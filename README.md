## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This repository contains an end-to-end **sentiment analysis pipeline** using the IMDb dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. The goal is to analyze the reviews with NLP techniques, clean and preprocess the data, visualize patterns (EDA), and fine-tune a BERT model for binary classification: **positive** vs **negative** sentiment.

In addition to standard accuracy-based evaluation, this project incorporates **CheckList**, a behavioral testing framework, to analyze model robustness through two key tests:
- **Invariance (INV):** Named Entities (NEs) are replaced with other entities to test whether model predictions remain stable.
- **Directional Expectation (DIR):** Emotionally charged adjectives/adverbs are added to observe changes in model confidence and sentiment output.

These tests help uncover hidden weaknesses that accuracy alone may not reveal.

A research paper is included to document the process and findings, focusing on model behavior, domain sensitivity, and the importance of nuanced evaluation methods in NLP.

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

The dataset used is the [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) from Kaggle.  
It contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews split evenly between positive and negative sentiments.

To use the dataset:
1. Download from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
2. Place the CSV in the `data/` directory as `raw_imdb_dataset.csv`.
