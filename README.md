## About the Project

This repository contains an end-to-end **sentiment analysis pipeline** using the IMDb dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. The goal is to analyze the reviews with NLP techniques, clean and preprocess the data, visualize patterns (EDA), and fine-tune a BERT model for binary classification: **positive** vs **negative** sentiment.

In addition to standard accuracy-based evaluation, this project incorporates **CheckList**, a behavioral testing framework, to analyze model robustness through two key tests:
- **Invariance (INV):** Named Entities (NEs) are replaced with other entities to test whether model predictions remain stable.
- **Directional Expectation (DIR):** Emotionally charged adjectives/adverbs are added to observe changes in model confidence and sentiment output.

These tests help uncover hidden weaknesses that accuracy alone may not reveal.

A research paper is included to document the process and findings, focusing on model behavior, domain sensitivity, and the importance of nuanced evaluation methods in NLP.

## Dataset

The dataset used is the [IMDB Dataset of 50K Movie Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews) from Kaggle.  
It contains 50,000 labeled movie reviews split evenly between positive and negative sentiments.

To use the dataset:
1. Download from the [Kaggle link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lakshmi25npathi/imdb-dataset-of-50k-movie-reviews).
2. Place the CSV in the `data/` directory as `raw_imdb_dataset.csv`.

## Workflow of the github and notebooks:

1. Training the BERT NER tagging model ()
2. Cleaning the raw IMDB dataset
3. Using the trained BERT model to tag IMDB Data
4. Fine tuning pretrained sentiment model from hugging face with 90% of cleaned IMDB data
5. Clean and tag yelp data same way of IMDB
6. Use cleaned YELP data as test data for the fine tuned model
7. Perturb cleaned IMDB data and use for sentiment analysis test
8. Test remaining 10% of cleaned IMDB data, perturbed IMDB data

## How to run the code

To run the code first you will have to download and install the 'requirements.txt' found in the "data" folder. 

### Project baseline model / BERT NER tagging model:

We have trained the model using the dataset. The parameters for the saved model can be found in a
