## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

This repository contains an end-to-end **sentiment analysis pipeline** using the IMDb dataset of 50,000 movie reviews. The goal is to analyze the reviews with NLP techniques, clean and preprocess the data, visualize patterns (EDA), and fine-tune a BERT model for binary classification: **positive** vs **negative** sentiment.
