When a movie like The Dukes of Hazzard brings in over 75 million it makes some incredibly sad statements about the condition of our own society Either we are collectively too stupid to stay away from trash like this or maybe Im just not realizing how many people this kind of noeffort trash will appeal tobr br Hollywood has had no incentive to make good movies since if it puts out trash then people will see it anyways since there is nothing else on screen This is that I walked out despite getting a free movie pass The dialogue could not be dumber The stunts could not be more overthetop and outrageous Perhaps this bigger that big image appeals to Texans but it didnt appeal to me nor anyone else in the theater None of the big names were in this careerending flick except for Burt Reynolds which says all you need to hear Jessica Simpson  dont make me laughbr br I wouldnt even recommend this film for video even if you were desperate This was all about fooling the public to make enough money after opening day to equal or do better than it cost through marketing They did despite the public being forewarned Stupidity abound,negative
This movie is probably for you It had an overall meditative quality from the music to the beautiful photography and listening to the often cliché things about life that Andy Goldsworthy would say as he worked or in between shots If youre familiar with Buddhism that is the sort of the sense I got out of this film The impermanence of life the beauty of nature the interconnectedness of all things etc However what I did not understand confused and ultimately forced me to leave without finishing I saw over an hour of it was the redundancy of the whole thing You only find out bits and pieces of why hes commissioned and how he can even afford to live off of this kind of work The art work comes alive but all his talking with no conclusions leads to dead ends,positive
Usually I dont think Hollywood productions are fit to be called film so I call them movies instead But this piece of elephant manure is not even fit to be called a movie hence the quotes in the titlebr br Where shall i start 1 If this isnt the start of geriatric casting it sure is the epitome of it Stefanie Powers is supposed to play someone even LESS than half her age shes supposed to play an 18 year old and she is FORTY effing TWO br br 2 A horrible and stupid mindless portrayal of Paris and France where we see cliché characters such as the sympathetic grumpy shop owner the bitchy queen of models the fairy god mother exqueen of models etc This film is surpassed only in this respect by the Da Vinci Code which reviewers correctly determined was a comedy br br 3 Its highly and utterly ridiculous to have no nudity in a film about a time and a place where nudity was so common place especially if the whole focus is about thatbr br 4 The horrible accents br br 5 The Nana Mouskouri elevatormusicbr br I could go on but i think this is enough And I was able to make these observations after watching this crap for just half an hour WHILE surfing the internet and talking to my friends about math equations  I mean br br I invite everyone to add to my list  P D,negative
As a Long Island independent film maker myself and having have had two theatrical releases under my producingdirecting belt I had always been told of how much I could learn by viewing a FRED CARPENTER production so I was lucky enough to have his Eddie Monroe as my initiation to his superb budgeting production casting settings and masterful directing talents My heart went out to its characters its story and was totally won over by the trickswitch ending that brought the films plot to fruition Locations were marvelously chosen and human emotions in its characters brought a realistic link to my bonding with all the elements that Mr Carpenter utilized throughout to his and his films benefit,positive
The Hazing is confused mumbojumbo that wants so hard to be The Evil Dead that it even references Bruce Campbell several times The problem is it is simply not in the same league as that terrific movie This movie is nowhere near as original The plot has been used before by Kevin Tenney in Night of the Demons and that was a lot more fun This flick wastes too much time with complicated exposition before getting the kids into the spooky mansion and starting the demonic happeningsbr br Brad Dourif is as usual not given much to do here but when he is on screen he puts in another overthetop performance that would make Christopher Walken jealous As for the acting of the kids its passable but by no means good The shaky camera work is more annoying than clever or atmospheric There are a few good moments when the first guy gets possessed and throws around some deadly one liners while dispatching his victims but it was never scary for a second The gore level is midrange to low but the director tries to make up for it by showing the actresses topless a few times All in all just okay if you have 87 minutes to waste,negative
One of the most disgusting films I have ever seen I wanted to vomit after watching it I saw this movie in my American History class and the purpose was to see an incite on the life of a farmer in the West during the late 1800s What we saw were pigs being shot and then slaughtered human birth branding Oh and at the end there was a live birth of a calf and let me tell you that the birth itself wasnt too bad but the numerous fluids that came out drove most people in my class to the bathroom The story itself was OK The premise of the story is a widow and her daughter and they move to the west to be a house keeper of this cowboy They live a life of hardship and it is an interesting a pretty accurate view of life in the West during the late 1800s But if you have a choice do not see this movie,negative
I could see this film is super He didnt surprise to oneself when so that it was taking place for the truth this way by itself how swigged flight to the which didnt have the place but it is only such an conspiratorial theory Rightbr br Very I liked watching this film when I was the child I am interesting which so that it was if it turned out that such a flight was taking place really certainly to it for not a belief because it is denying logic and the common sense Who at healthy senses sent to kids with space shuttle into the orbit I very like reading for the subject American and Soviet space programs I know a few missions of space shuttles remained provided by CIA with the clause TOP SECRET certainly these are only such my divagations but who knows,positive
Good Folks I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers My academic specialty is AngloSaxon literature and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves The Icelandic Beowulf and Grendel is the least offensive I have seen and I did pay 300 for my copy This SciFi version ranks with the Christopher Lambert version Yuckbr br What didnt I like CGI for one Amazingly bad More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting I am used to both with all the versions I have seenbr br Delighted Regardless Peter,negative
This film has some rather shocking scenes and subject matter considering it was made in 1971br br Clint Eastwood Geraldine Page and Elizabeth Hartman do excellent work in the film as do all the cast membersbr br Set during the Civil War the film begins when a wounded Yankee soldier Johnny portrayed by Clint Eastwood is given refuge and help at a girls academy located in the southbr br The headmistress of the school Ms Farnsworth Geraldine Page the one teacherEdwina Elizabeth Hartman and a small group of half grown girls have been without a man in their midst for perhaps a little too longbr br While their loyalties lay with the Confederacy their emotions and physical needs definitely lead them in the opposite direction Johnny immediately uses his masculine charms to try to win the women over to his sideand keep them from turning him over to the patrollersbr br However feelings previously stoked by incestuous behavior an adulterous father a brutal rape and adolescent inexperience combined with jealousiesturn things upside down with some unexpected consequences for both Johnny and the schools residentsbr br 10 stars,positive
Lets see What annoyed me most The extra long dance scene in the beginning watching people twirling around so much I got dizzy Without even showing where the music was coming from All part of a college graduation that had nothing to do with the rest of the film Or perhaps it was the fact that each scene lasted about fifteen minutes longer than they had to What a drag this film is And the most annoying aspect is the bad guys are so bad so obviously horrible that it seems as if the director were making this film for second graders These people are bad These people are good Whenever a movie has its agendaheart on its sleeve I am beside myself Theres a scene in a rollerskating rink that seems totally out of place Long drawnout love scenes with the main character and a Russian prostitute that seems more like a rock star and his sexy groupie John Hurts character who is part of the overlong beginning scene drinks and disagrees with the overdone villains His death scene could very well be the stupidest in history And I hear everyone even the haters of this film talk about how gorgeous the cinematography is I think it looks washedout Watch Days of Heaven if you want to see gorgeous backyards This movie is even worse than the anti hype Its pointless The epilogue showing the main character in a yacht was almost as dumb as the prologue The battle scenes are tedious and dizzying This movie is really bad Avoid it unless you love bad movies because this is the king of them,negative
The movie was better than what i expected I was working on the movie set for a short period of time when Damien was making this filmThe gun fire stunt and acting came out pretty good on the editing tipAll thou the the music wasnt all that great Better music would have top this filmSome of the music sound like the hippie days Damien remember you have gang violence gangsters some oldies or hip hop would have did it It was more realistic than blood in blood outThe casting was picked real wellSuspectentertaint did a good job in this filmThe movie brought back a fill of a life style i use to live But than at the end you do not always win And in my history thats how it wasI adapted to the movie the first time i watched itDamien Congratulatoins on this film,positive
I saw the movie late one night on cable and could not believe how bad it was I usually enjoy bad movies but this one was so revolting that it wasnt even entertaining Some of the highlights of this film include the absurd music which is constantly playing throughout the movie the hideous special effects when someone is shot with a laser gun they turn neon green and promptly disintegrate and the disgusting acting The acting in fact is what I feel steals the show I didnt recognize any of the actors in the movie and I hope that I never have to see any of them again Overall I recommend renting this movie if you can find it I cant imagine a video store carrying this garbage just so that you can learn to appreciate quality films after seeing this trash,negative
I think Phillip Kaufman read the cliffs Notes version of the Kundera novel and then set about making this film Okay of course it wont have the punch of the original Kunderas novels are great because of his manipulation of the narrative concept his ability to step in and out of stories he constructs This film does not even try The one dream sequence of Terezas so vital to the atmosphere of the book is reworked and makes no sense whatsoever Also and this is perhaps a lesser point Daniel DayLewis looks a lot like Ben Stiller in this I know its not really a valid complaint but hey A perfect example of the Hollywoodizing of otherwise fine literature,negative
Ive watched this movie twice now on DVD and both times it didnt fail to impress me with its unique impartial attitude It seems more like a depiction of reality than most other Hollywood fare especially on a topic that is still hotly discussed Even though it sticks closely with the southern viewpoint it doesnt fail to question it and in the end the only sentence passed is that the war is lost not matter what and cruelty is a common denominatorbr br What really makes this movie outstanding is the refusal to overdramatize Nowadays truly good movies in a nutshell are few and far apart with mainstream fare being enjoyable if you dont have high expectations but terribly commercially spirited I think this movie comes off as a truly good movie without being a masterpiece because it sticks to itself and gives the viewer a chance to watch and analyze it instead of wanting to bombard him with effect and emotion to blot out his intelligence This movie is cool observant and generally lighthanded in its judgement which is GOODbr br The story has its flaws especially Jewels Character comes off doubtfully but then again the situation at the time was so chaotic that for a young widow it might have been only logical to somehow get back into a normal life even by liberally taking each next guy Still she doesnt come off as weak in fact I think shes one of the stronger characters shes always in control of the relationships with the men just tagging And I take it very gratefully that shes not a weeping widow I believe in the 19th century death of a loved one was something a lot more normal than now You could die so easily of even minor illnesses and injuries so the prospect of of someone dying while surely causing grief didnt traumatise people like it does now People didnt seem to build shrines about their lost ones like they do now and I like that attitudebr br My recommendation is for intelligent people to watch this movie if they are in the mood for something different than the usual hollywood fare Dont watch if if you want nonstop action or heartrenting emotion,positive
the fact that there was so much fuss is ironic as the whole point of the programme was to highlight the way the media treat such taboo subjects such as paedophilia the newsdesk set the suits the smug presenters the menatthescene shouting about things you can see behind them the pointless cgi graphs and stats the whole thing was a satire a very very funny satire the way clist celebritys will say absolutely anything if their agent tells them itll be good for their career there is no evidence for it but it is scientific fact It may be hard to watch with milly dowler and the cambridgeshire girls as well as 911 but satire is supposed to be challenging and we shouldnt be afraid to stand up against the blatant scaremongering and headline grabbing media just because its a delicate matter How this show failed to win any TV awards for its intelligence observation courage acting and thought provocation is shameful but as watching it will show you not in the least bit surprising,positive
This is my favorite of the older Tom  Jerry cartoons from the early 40s The original version with Mammy Two Shoes is on the Tom  Jerry Spotlight Collection 2 set disc one and showcases the wonderful detailed animation of the early cartoons The gags on this one arent all madcap Avery style but more subtle and aimed at anyone whos ever stayed up late watching scary movies or radio programs Tom is listening to a creepy radio show and Jerry decides to play a number of tricks to spook him The ninelives gag is well done here and I dont know how many times I tried to make a vacuum and a sheet that scary when I was a kid When Toms owner is awakened by the ruckus Mammy was NOT the maid it was HER house she gets one heck of a surprise with a big laugh Get your pause button ready its worth it,positive
Charles Chaplins Shoulder Arms of 1918 was his longest film to date though at just over 45 minutes in length it was not quite a feature film With World War One just drawing to a close many popular entertainers of the time were doing their part to inspire their native troops and Chaplin was no exception And so the lovable Tramp went to war The film begins with the Tramp in training and the character is hilariously inept at even the simplest military drills including marching and gunslinging much to the disgust of his drill sergeant The Tramp then finds himself in the trenches faced with a more formidable foe though the Germans eventually turn out of be infinitely more incompetent than even he The uproarious moment when the Tramp declares that he singlehandedly captured thirteen German soldiers by surrounding them had me in stitchesbr br There are plenty of other great moments in this film Chaplin awaking to find his sleeping barracks underwater and being unable to literally find his own feet is hilarious as is his ingenious use of a tube from a record player to sleep beneath the surfacebr br However the most memorable scenes in the film undoubtedly involve Chaplin skulking behind enemy lines disguised as a tree The reactions of the bumbling German soldiers unknowingly just metres from a sworn enemy as they are singlehandedly disabled onebyone are highly amusing especially when one soldier grapples an axe with the intention of cutting down a tree for firewoodbr br This is a very enjoyable film and one of the best of Chaplins pre1920 efforts Highly recommended,positive
I watched this again after having not seen it since it first came out in 97 and it still made me laugh out loud Its skillfully written Kevin Kline and Joan Cusack are both perfect in their roles and if you can look at Bob Newhart in this movie and not chuckle youre more of a man than Ibr br For that matter I think the scenes where Tom Selleck kisses Kevin Kline where Kevin Kline listens to the How to be a Man cassette and the postalmostwedding scenes w Joan Cusack are three of the funniest scenes in any moviebr br Sure the last scene is a bit of an excuse for a happy ending butfew movies are perfect,positive
Franco Nero stars as Cole a ninja who comes to the rescue of his war buddy Frank Landers Alex Courtney and his fetching wife Susan George to protect them from a mobster Christopher George who wants the land Things get even more complicated when the mobster hires Coles old nemesis Sho Kosugi who is also a ninja Inept martial arts actioner while having better production values then most ninja movies fails to inject any life into the surroundings or for that matter actionscenes A poor effort all around,negative
It starts quite good but after a while you start to expect more from this film than you are actually getting Everything becomes unclear and unclear it stays Czech filmmakers were good 20 or more years ago But after they transfered to Capitalistic country here it is Czech unofficial but well known mentality  COPYING  COPYING  COPYING of everything they consider good when they see it in another movies or countries or elsewhere I think that this is a good example of making art and politics and horror and humor and film and money And it remains me of the One Flew Over the Cuckoos Nest which can not be compared to this film in the way of ART and ACTORS and STORY and POLITICS I think this film is boring It could be done better At least they tried Sorry guys  CANOT NOT Recommend,negative
Something about Paulie touched my heart as few movies do It is a witty funny yet emotional movie Im a late comer in becoming a fan of this movie I didnt see Paulie until May 2004 and have since ordered the Widescreen DVD from a seller at eBaybr br The special effects of showing Paulie talking are superb My son asked me how the bird knew so many phrasesProbably my favorite part of the movie is when Paulie is in Gena Rowlands Ivys company followed by Cheech Marin Ignacio Tony Shalhoub Misha plays an excellent part as the good hearted human You root for him all the way through the moviebr br You cant go wrong renting or buying this movie,positive
How much do I love this film Now Im not a fan of bad films but I do love a film that is so bad its good This is one of those Juan Pablo Di Pace has a great butt looks fab on screen and definitely doesnt make a bad turn at his acting debut I believe Billy Zane is suitably mean and moody though I still constantly feel that there is something more in him I felt it in Titanic the look on his face when La Winslet spat on him for example totally broken shocked and putdown  fierce Kelly Brook is a pretty face  no seriously I think thats it Its worth catching this to see one really hot guy some big bra fillers from Brook nasty growling from Billy laugh at the dialogue revel in the scenery and madness of the whole affair  Im gona go watch it again now  yes I bought it,negative
Really really bad slasher movie A psychotic person escapes from an asylum Three years later he kills a sociology professor end of scene One semester yesterday later hey thats what the title card said a new sociology professor is at the school She makes friends with another female sociology professor who works there and starts dating another professor The students are all bored as are webr br There are a number of title cards indicating how much time has passed Scenes are pretty short and cut to different characters somewhere else making for little progression of any kind A lot of scenes involve characters walking and talking or sitting and talking and serve little purpose Despite the passage of time many of the characters are always wearing the same clothing Sometimes the unclear passage of time means when we see a body for the second time we ask ourselves how long has that body been there And also at least one of the dead people dont seem to have been missed by othersbr br The killer manages to kill one person by stabbing her in the breast another by stabbing him in the crotch and another by slicing her forehead Is his knife poisoned or somethingbr br The video box cover has a cheerleader there arent any in the movie The rear cover has a photo of someone in a graduation cap and gown menacing a group of women in a dorm room The central redhead in the photo is in the movie but nobody ever wears such an outfit and there is no such scene The killer is strictly oneonone,negative
This documentary begins with an interesting premise  it makes an intriguing and convincing argument that the history of Jesus as is commonly believed is probably a myth Sadly though after priming us with this the movie completely shifts gears and becomes little more than a nonstop attack on Christianity and pretty much focusing on the easy targetsbr br The writerdirector clearly has some issues with the Church he is a former evangelical Christian and has some legit anger and this film seems to be his form of release Itd be interesting to see the first 20 minutes expanded but as a whole the movie is disappointing,negative
If this film were to be rated on a scale of 1 to 10 one would need to create a new rating system as this one should not even qualify The films plot if you can call it that revolves around Charlie Stephen Baldwin an ex special operatives agent who is being targeted by the brother of a man he killed while he was still working for the US govt If this sounds like an interesting scenario please dont be fooled as this film will not deliver that which its actionthemed story suggestsbr br Comedian Chris Rock once said that when one sees an actor doing a bad film that it makes one want to send the actor 50 given that the actor must be desperate for money to be doing such poor quality work After watching this film you may want to send Stephen Baldwin 100 br br It appears that Baldwin did not put any effort into his role in the film In the film Baldwin is forced to run all over the city of Los Angeles in order to protect his honeycomb wife from being murdered by the brother of a man he previously killed However throughout the picture it appears that Baldwin can barely pull off maintaining a light jog His laid back performance succeeds in subtracting from any suspense that the film might have intended to portray br br If you are the type of person who enjoys watching very bad films and laughing at their shortcomings than this film is for you However if you are looking for a well made action thriller it would be best to look somewhere else rather than renting this film,negative
This review is in response to the submission wondering how factually correct the movie wasbr br Saw this movie last year and found it inspiring that hopeful immigrants like my Italian grandparents who came through Ellis Island at the turn of the last century would subject themselves to all manner of invasive inspection just to enter Americabr br It was certainly eye opening since my grandparents never spoke of anything terrible while there My grandmother was 5years old and my grandfather 18 when they arrivedbr br I just returned from a trip to New York where I had the pleasure of visiting Ellis Island and the museum actually walks you through the immigration evaluation process  The filmmaker obviously did his research right down to the medical exams and equipment questions and puzzles They are all there at the museum Even the wedding pictures and the review board room  Factually correct Anyone who has immigrant grandparents should see this movie Inspirational to say the least,positive

From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was hooked I had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy scifi movie Instead I found a highly entertaining on the edge of your seat thought provoking action film The movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick The actors are amazing Radah Mitchell High Art Love and other as Fry is truly a joy to watch on screen while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak againbr br The look of the movie is breath taking the contrast of blues yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing Followed by the complete darkness of nightfall I would truly recommend any lover of the ALIEN movies or Radha Mitchell which is why I went to see it to check out this film Im sure by the end youll look at the dark in a whole new way,positive
You gotta love the spaghetti western universe The vision of a west where good guys get shot point blank with no warning cartoonish villains chew the scenery in extreme closeups and the antihero walks away from the girl in the end A lot of people call Corbuccis films depressing I find that a bit dodgy as far as descriptions go I think bleak and unforgiving are more apt mostly because depressing suggests a level of sentimentality almost every Eurowestern director ignored in favour of painting characters in broad strokesbr br GLI SPECIALISTI must be seen in all its widescreen glory before it can take its proper place in the Sergio Corbucci canon Its a beautiful movie And it makes sense that Corbucci wanted to blow off some steam with COMPANEROS after the unremitting one two punch of THE GREAT SILENCE and this although he would later revert back to his usual tricks with the foulmouthed SONNY AND JED Theres still a certain amount of caricature that detracts from the overall grimness of the movie imo it hurts more than does any good to have a needless inclusion of three kids dressed like hippies skulking around town in search of gold and trouble And it hurts to have Mario Adorf playing Mexican onehanded bandit El Diablo as over the top as he always plays his charactersbr br Those minor gripes aside theres more than enough here to wet the palate of the spaghetti aficionado Shootouts galore the population of an entire town reduced to crawling naked in the dirt the typical iconic badassitude of the laconic antihero played by Johnny Halliday the moral bankruptcy of almost every character in the movie Corbucci might never receive the acclaim of the more famous Sergio or the American patriarchs of the genre but you and I know thats a gross injustice for a very talented director His dynamic shot selection in depth staging with objects sticking close to the camera and receding in the background his flair for quick pacing and feverish energy in moving a story that wasnt always all that along the way he photographs open spaces everything in his work makes me sure that if Corbucci was American and had emerged 15 years later along with Mann and Hawks the Cahiers du Cinema critics would have lauded him as an auteur worthy of serious critical consideration,positive

This film is a variation of a theme weve all seen over and over again  the Posiedan adventure in Space The characters are all stock characters  feisty heroine Judas coward etc etc The only question really is whos next to snuff it Sometimes this tried and tested formula works  like in this case  but more often not  like the truly mindnumbing Red Planet br br So why does this one work Because its stylish The acting is above average And above all it isnt predictable The conclusion isnt signposted I really had no idea how it would all end and was surprised at how it did end That alone deserves top marks in my bookbr br Its an intriguing and entertaining movie And though it was never likely to change the face of cinema as we know it it doesnt disappoint,positive
One of the many speculations about Y2K was that the world was going to end at the stroke of midnight on December 31 1999 In The Book Of Life writerdirector Hal Hartley takes a look at the possible ramifications of a new millennium Armageddon beginning with the return of Jesus to Earth on New Years Eve 99 The story examines the task of the Son of God who must open the remaining three of the seven seals contained in the Book of Life now contained in a Mac laptop computer in which there is also the names of the onehundred and fortyfour thousand good souls who will be spared on the last day Jesus Martin Donovan along with Magdalena PJ Harvey arrives in New York City to make the preparations necessary for carrying out his Fathers will but he begins to have second thoughts must he judge the living and the dead Do they deserve what must befall them It is a cup He would prefer not to embrace at this particular moment which gives encouragement to Satan Thomas Jay Ryan who fears that the fruit of all his hard labor is about to be washed away at midnight for he can only continue his work so long as there are people around who cling to their pitiful hopes and dreams An artistically rendered high concept film Hartley presents the story in an intelligent thought provoking manner taking great care in dealing with the sensitive subject matter so as to make it inoffensive even to the most ardent fundamentalist The dialogue between Jesus and Satan is intriguing and stimulating as is the effect of their presence upon those they encounter during their corporeal stay in the city Its an engrossing meditation on the spiritual side of Mans fragile existence and a contemplation of that which has been prophesied in the Revelations of St John in the Apocalypse the last Book of the New Testament And there is logic in Hartleys approach to the Second Coming he maintains the aesthetic of the contemporary setting while employing altered film speeds which visually give the film an ethereal quality Christ inconspicuously wears a suit and tie effectively blending in with the populace while Satans attire is a bit more casual his appearance somewhat scruffy he sports a bruise above his left eye Donovan is well cast as Jesus lending a benevolent mien and a sense of restrained urgency to his character that is very effective It is of course a unique portrayal of The Saviour and possibly the best since Max von Sydows in The Greatest Story Ever Told He successfully conveys a feeling of inner peace and tranquility of serenity that is the essence at the very core of the character And Ryan is thoroughly engaging in his role of the Prince of Darkness he has a distinct manner of speech and a resonant quality to his voice that make him absolutely mesmerizing to watch His eyes are darkly penetrating a trait he uses effectively with furtive glances and captivating stares Hes the guy who could sell you anything in exchange for your soul before you ever knew what hit you Its a memorable performance that contrasts so well with Donovans portrayal of Jesus The supporting cast includes Martin Pfeffercorn Martyr Miho Nikaido Edie Dave Simonds Dave DJ Mendel Lawyer James Urbaniak True Believer Katreen Hardt Lawyers Assistant and Anna Kohler Hotel Clerk In his own inimitable style with The Book Of Life Hartley has crafted a perspective of the last days that is interesting entertaining and truly unique He has a way of capturing life as it is just off center a method which works especially well with a film like this Comparatively short for a feature film running time of 63 minutes it nevertheless is one of Hartleys best and more than worth the price of admission Its a film that will stay with you and perhaps make you think about some things you may have tucked away in a corner of your mind for later And that is part of the attraction of this film it makes you realize that later most likely is now I rate this one 910,positive

Four Daughters begins as just another clone of Little Women type melodrama A single father with four musically talented eligible daughters has his hands full trying to keep them in line and guide them in their courting rituals What turns the film around is the sudden appearance of a new Hollywood star some critics say the first antihero long before James Dean graced the big screen From the time the dark foreboding figure of Mickey Borden John Garfield appears at Ann Lemps Priscilla Lane gate splashing his selfpity and doomed philosophy on the rest of the cast Four Daughters becomes much more than just a chick flickbr br Though Garfield is the main reason to watch Four Daughters there are other flashes of brilliance to enjoy Hungarianborn director Michael Curtiz later responsible for such gems as Casablanca and Mildred Pierce pinpoints certain images with his camera aided by cinematographer Ernest Haller of Rebel Without A Cause fame that sticks in the viewers mind for example the screeching gate that Anns first suitor Felix Deitz Jeffrey Lynn swings on so merrily becomes symbolic of the shifts in moods and affections by those who use itbr br That Garfield delivers the standout performance is obvious but the rest of the cast keeps up with him most of the way The underrated Jeffrey Lynn plays his role to perfection as the neglected suitor whose love for his cherished Ann never falters even when shes with another man Claude Rains somewhat miscast as the father of the four comingofage young women gives a fine portrayal of a set upon doting family head who gets lost in the shuffle The three Lane Sisters already famous for their musical abilities turn into accomplished actresses playing their parts well A raft of supporting actors including Dick Foran Frank McHugh May Robson and Eddie Acuff makes it all believablebr br How opposites attract is part of the ploy for touching the quick of the viewers imagination Ann is the eternal optimist even when she and Mickey are down and out She always looks on the bright side and like so many caught in the pliers of the Great Depression in those days she saw prosperity just around the corner Mickey recites an entire list of bad things that have happened to him seeking company in his misery from Ann which Ann refuses to do Mickey expects to go out with a bolt of lightning striking him dead as he rounds the corner of life Mickey has meager talent as a composer Ann has talent to spare as a singer and musician Ann is big on beauty Mickey is big on personality in a warped sense of a way And the differences go on and on How all this is reconciled in the end is an important part of the movie not to be missedbr br See Four Daughters for John Garfields doozy of an acting debut on the big screen The only time he was better came seven years later when he again mesmerized the film goers with one of the greatest screen performances ever as Frank Chambers in The Postman Always Rings Twice opposite the equally charismatic Lana Turner But also watch Four Daughters to catch important elements that may be missed if too much concentration is placed on the star of the show,positive

After starting watching the reruns of old Columbo movies I thought they would all get about the same vote from me 6 But apparently Im now starting to see differences in the movies It happened in some of just previous episodes that showed some pretty genius directing and it shows in this one but in the negative waybr br The movie was so boring that I sometimes found myself occupied peaking in the paper instead of watching never happened during a Columbo movie before and sometimes it was so embarrassing that I had to look away The directing seems too pretentious The scenes with the ohsomature neighbourgirl are a misplace And generally the lines and plot is weaker than the average episode Then scene where they debated whether or not to sack the trumpeter who falsely was accused for the murder is pure horror really stupidbr br Some applause should be given to the prelude however In this episode a lot of focus is given on how the murderer tries to secure his alibi and hide the evidence etc I really liked that But alas no focus on how Columbo reveals all this And the proof that in the end leaves Columbo victorious is the silliest everbr br Rating lies between 4 and 5,negative

Highly politically charged drama that while biased is extremely wellhandled and one of the most intelligent films ever made It contains almost no preaching but rather follows a naive TV reporter who gradually comes to realize the threat presented by nuclear power plants not because of an inherent danger but because the purveyors are more interested in the bottom line than in the safety of those affectedbr br Many hated the film because they saw it as a political tract made by ultraliberals like Jane Fonda and Michael Douglas but if you view it simply as a drama its gripping exciting full of welldeveloped distinctive characters and ultimately a truly suspenseful contemporary thriller that hits close to homebr br Historical note For some especially those in the energy industry and inhabitants of the Harrisburg PA metro area it hit perhaps a little too close to home as less than a week after this film was released the devastating explosion at the Three Mile Island nuclear facility occurredbr br Update 04082007 In the nearly a decade since I first wrote this critique Ive heard a lot of commentary on the film One thing I think really needs to be noted is that this film is not the ultraliberal antinuclear tirade that its often tagged as beingbr br While the makers and stars are or were notable Hollywood establishment liberals what this film attacks is not the very idea of nuclear power but rather the idea of human greed corruption and fallibility calling into question the potential hazards of something that nature has already made dangerousbr br No one who accepts reality can argue the fact that human exposure to nuclear radiation is at least quite likely to be fatal Close friends of mine who worked at a nuclear plant for several years even told me of their employers official policy on the maximum safe exposure levels that its employees could handlebr br You dont have to believe that corporations are inherently evil in order to accept that individuals in pursuit of wealth and power are greedy and often corrupt And even if you refute that claim you cant dispute that all humans are prone to make mistakes When it comes to exposing innocent people to nuclear radiation we cant afford any mistakes and that more than anything is the argument this film seeks to makebr br Condemn it if you must but try to have a little perspective Were currently engaged in a war whose ongoing results are quite different from those originally predicted an incredibly costly war with no end in sight And whether or not you feel the war was necessary to combat global terrorism you cant dispute the reality that the length the financial cost and most importantly the loss of human life have all far exceeded the levels that the experts assured us of back in 2003 So even if no one involved is greedy or corrupt mistakes were made and mistakes of a pretty serious magnitude to boot The same kind of serious mistakes if allowed to arise in the nuclear industry could render much of the earths surface uninhabitable,positive
The true story of a Spanish paraplegic Ramón Sampedro who fought for decades for the right to be euthenized This film along with the Best Picture winner of the same year Million Dollar Baby caused a stir that year with their depictions of disabled persons desiring death Both advocates for the disabled and unfortunately for the disability advocates conservative prolife groups protested both films and their Oscar nominations The nominations also came during the entire Terry Schiavo debacle just to put it all in some historical perspective The protests especially from the disability groups against Million Dollar Baby make some sense  the film clearly depicted without wavering the life of a paraplegic as worthless The films central character Maggie Fitzgerald becomes a paraplegic doesnt seem to get any counseling whatsoever no help whatsoever and immediately wants to die The film is honestly pretty dumb and uncomplex The Sea Inside based on the true story is certainly a lot more thoughtful on the subject It most likely got railroaded into the same category as Million Dollar Baby without its protesters having even seen it an incredibly common phenomenon The film does give time to many different sides of the argument And it immediately declares that the wish to die is that of the protagonist and the protagonist alone It is guilty of a couple of crimes though and Id still understand why disability groups could have a problem with it First and foremost theres the protagonists meeting with a paraplegic bishop I dont look kindly on the way hes depicted His orally operated wheelchair is depicted as absurd and theres almost a comic sequence where his effeminate boytoy servants are dragging him in his chair up the stairs He cant even reach the room in which Ramón is located and one of the boytoys is forced to carry the conversation between them I had to think gee maybe if Ramón lived in a slightly more wheelchairaccessible household he wouldnt spend his entire life in bed and might find life more fulfilling who knows how closely the film depicts the reality Director Amenábar The Others also includes some laughable scenes that try to make this film about suicide more lifeaffirming like a crosscut sequence where Ramón looks thoughtful and his lawyers baby is born But besides a few ugly moments the film is very good It hurts that someone may want to die when they have the ability to bring so much joy and insight into the lives of others However in the end our lives do belong to us Shouldnt we have the right to choose The films strongest asset is its supporting characters and the actors who play them It depicts how Ramóns fight and decisions affect those around him with a beautiful precision The family members in particular are great and Ramóns final departure from them is absolutely heartbreaking and had me in tears My favorite performance in the film comes from Lola Dueñas whom I also felt gave the best or at least certainly most undervalued performance in Almodóvars Volver last year,positive
Slow Slow Slow There is no mystery or excitement in this film If you dont figure out who the mole is in the first ten minutes you must be brain dead The secret service must have been too because it took them the whole film to put it together There are no compelling characters in the movie not film The pace of the movie is slow there is no tension The hired killer is an excellent shot unless he is aiming at Michael Douglas than all he seems to be able to hit is large panes of glass The funniest scene in the movie is when the presidents wife says the code word at the anticlimactic ending It is laugh out loud ridiculous At least six people got up and left the movie early I would have joined them if I were not sitting in the middle of the row I would not recommend this film to anyone,negative
John Holmes is so famous hes infamous as the Three Amigos would say This is a Rashomonlike story about the events surrounding the Wonderland Murders of the early 1980s in Los Angeles The story is pieced together from the retelling of a few of the participants There is story from the friends perspective namely David Lind played by Dylan McDermott He is a participant in the robbery assault at Eddie Nashs place Eddie Nash is a infamous drug dealer  and is the suppose to be the same character Alfred Molina played in Boogie Nights and is heavily into the drug scene There is John Holmes perspective played by Val Kilmer which makes him out to be a pawn stuck between two kings with a severe case of cocaine cravings There is also the patchwork recollections of Johns wife Sharon  played by Lisa Kudrow and his girlfriend Dawn  played by Kate Bosworth that fill in the spaces between the two stories It is basically the same time frame that we are looking at just each characters version The only thing that is missing is the perspective from the dead people br br Paul Thomas Andersons Boogie Nights portrays John Holmes as a slightly heroic character with a tragic yet comedic karma He is a caricature of a real person He was more of less a mixed up kid that got what he got through his large endowment Director James Cox turns the comedy off and makes this episode in Johns life into a nightmare for all of us watching The details of the real life murders make this movie even more eeriebr br Val Kilmer took what he learned of Jim Morrison from the Doors enhanced the performance for the Salton Sea and then further enhanced that to bring us the deterioration of John Holmes through cocaine All of the actors pull off very realistic looking portrayals of cocaine junkies Josh Lucas performance stands out as one of the best in the movie He plays Ron Launius I think this character is suppose to be the same as the Thomas Jane character from Boogie Nights Ron was the leader of the gang loved having John Holmes around as a novelty and had a cocaine craving like sharks enjoy blood The cocaine use seems so realistic as to make one think Did they really use Splenda  br br Where Boogie Nights has a bubblegum pop feel to it lots of color and 70s nostalgia Wonderland is dark The action is fast and furious with a lot of jumps It is twitchy and grainy There is no comedy just a never ending pace as if the director is trying to put us into the nervous fast paced edgy cocaine high to make us feel what the characters are feeling This is a graphic movie It has one of the most intensely violent scenes I have ever seen in a movie It actually shows the murders themselves through the eyes of John Holmes at first and then from a third person perspective It is so graphic it looks like police evidence of a crime I had to pause after this scene and remind myself this was just a movie This movie is definitely not recommended for everyone I recommend it as a good alternative to Boogie Nights for those interested in the other sides of John Holmesbr br Celluloid Rehab,positive
A great performance by Emily Grace I stumbled upon this movie while browsing my satellite listings and was curious by the summary of the plot giving by my satellite service provider I was high entertained and had much compassion for the character Alice played by Emily Grace The story had me guessing in what would happen to Alice and was not predicable The overall story was refreshing and had some great twists to the supporting characters The ending of the story ended on a rather fair way I will purchase this DVD to add to my library I am a new fan of Emily Grace and I high anticipate in seeing more from her performances,positive

I watched the McCoys reunion and was glad to see Richard Crenna and Kathleen Nolan and Tony MartinezTo see them now was wonderful because I always watched the show growing up so when the TV said that there was going to be a reunion I was so excited  The only thing I could not figure out is why Lydia Reed Hassie McCoy and Michael Winkelmanlittle Luke was not on thereI know that Walter Brennan had died So I got on my computer and tried to find out about them and found this site so if there is anyone out there that can tell me what ever happened to Lydia Reed Hassie McCoy and Michael Winkelman little Luke I would be thankful I have searched everywere and no luck The only thing I could find out about Michael Winkelman is he was supposed to be born in 1946 This show had value and morals each show gave a lesson to be learnedThe shows today dont have thatThe whole cast was incredable the only thing better than finding out obout them would be to meet them So since that is impossible if there is anyone that can help please do Thank You Glenda,positive
This one tends to get slighted by a lot of critics and Kurosawa fans but I thought it was wonderful Its an episodic multicharacter study of Tokyos poorest who live in a city literally made from garbage Though it looks like an ABomb just hit the film has a sort of serene beauty thanks to the glorious use of Technicolor The title comes from the sound made by the insane young man who drives an imaginary trolley through the slum All the characters were wonderful and all the stories engrossing but perhaps the most tragic concerns the man and his young son who live in an abandoned car When not searching for food they spend their spare time using their imagination to build their dream house An emotionally moving and beautiful film,positive

This movie was a dismal attempt at recreating a crucial time in English history The film version of Cromwells growing involvement in the War is marginally accurate but the overall historical accuracy of this movie was way off This film implies that the war was started over religious differences but the Civil War was in no way Catholic versus Protestant both sides were Protestant Cromwell was never present at the battle of Edgehill nor did he ever save the day The royalists did not win the battle ended in a drawbr br As another reviewer has noted Cromwell was certainly not one of the Five Members who were to be removed from the House and arrested br br Overall this movie was decent The producers tried WAY to hard and it didnt turn out so great br br definitely could have been better,negative

As a semifilm buff I had heard of this infamous movie a long time ago I had heard that it was basically a 15 million dollar film about the tyrannical rule of the Roman emperor Caligula complete with hardcore pornography What struck me was that it was a porno movie yet it had great thespians like Peter OToole John Geilgud Malcolm McDowell and Hellen Mirren in it A week ago I saw a documentary about Caligula on the History channel and this film came back into my head and finally my curiousity got the best of me I foolishly rented the DVD and even more foolishly watched itbr br Within the first 30 minutes I was seeing acts of sex and especially violence that would earn an NC17 even by todays standards Was it really necessary to have a scene of a man having his urinary track closed and then have gallons of wine poured into him and then have his stomach cut with a sword all in very graphic detail And a scene where a guy gets his d cut off and fed to dogs again in very graphic detailand this just scratches the surface The argument for this movie from those who like it seems that it is the only film that honestly portrays pagan Rome and its excesses When in fact what this movie really is is sheer exploitation From beginning to end you see nothing but endless torture and decapitations and every kind of violence and crude behavior imaginable sadomasochism rape necrophelia it just never stopped There is no insight into Caligula himself what might have propelled him to go mad the horrible childhood he had that molded him into a sadist as an adult This is not a historic film it is sleaze Even the porn in this movie stinks and through much of this when I wasnt gagging I was just incredibly bored By the time it was over I was depressed didnt feel much like eating and this movie does the impossible it actually can turn you off of sexbr br What were these great actors thinking when they got into this I did read that the porn segments were filmed after the principal shooting was completed which explains why none of the main actors are in any of these scenes and why the quality of these scenes is so poor But still and all these actors must have known what they were getting into Right at the opening credits it says Penthouse Magazine and Bob Gucionne Presents And the scenes that the famous actors actually take part in are completely repulsive in and of themselves Apparently director Tinto Brass wanted his name removed from the completed film entirely as did the screenwriter Gore Vidal of all people Even John Geilgud and Peter Otoole were begging people not to see this when it opened at the Cannes film festivalbr br For the amount of money the producers spent on this the movies quality is terrible Everything is underlit and murky as if the film was dropped in a swamp prior to being developed and thats when youre lucky enough to view a scene thats actually infocus The sound is poorly dubbed much of the music is awkward and the editing is god awfulbr br Anyway I brought this movie on myself My advicedont watch this dont watch this dont watch thisas for myself tomorrow night I am going to watch something lighterlike DAWN OF THE DEAD,negative
It seems that Dee Snyder ran out of ideas halfway through the script The second half of the movie is basically just a rehash of the first which makes the film very boring To sum up Cops daughter is suckered into party via chatroom where she is sexually molestedtortured by psychopath played by Snider Cop rescues her psychopath is put in therapyjail Psychopath is released four years later and the whole thing is played out AGAIN Within all this are many unexplained plot elements Why was Captain Howdy psycho in the first place Whats with the onetime personality detour to biblethumper How does he kidnap all the adults and manage to sew their mouths shut without a struggle And perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery of all how does a 62 man with pink hair hide himself completely behind a 56 average build woman These are just some of the questions I had watching this filmbr br It seems that Snyder was trying to make some kind of commentary on a the dangers of online chatrooms b the hypocrisy of Christian sexual mores and c the effect our twisted puritanical society has on us as individuals If that is so he failed The movie is just too poorly done to entertain never mind convey social messages The torture scenes are stupid and boring bordering on silly especially when Snyder goes into one of his pain and death monologues and everything else is just plain dumb The call tracing scene is really lame when are the cops gonna get caller ID and 69 The young partner of the main cop character is particularly awful he shouldnt be working as an actor basically And the audio in the final showdown scene is really poor I guess they couldnt afford two boom mikesbr br The rest of the acting is not awful but its not good either The cop is pretty one note and his detached quality is not quite believable Dee Snyder is actually not too bad but he snarls and sneers way too much Robert Englund who deserves way better puts in a somewhat amusing performance of a hypocritical redneck If youre a big Robert Englund fan the movie is probably worth seeing just for him Everyone else is forgettablebr br In conclusion weve seen all these plot elements done before and done better in films like SILENCE OF THE LAMBS HELLRAISER and TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE I suggest you rent one of those instead of watching this turkey 310br br ,negative

How to take Charles Darwins fantastic intellectual journey and turn it into a chick flick His pivotal and seminal ideas and their radical influence on Western thought and capitalist society are untouched except for two brief scenes in one of which it is claimed he is killing God pure demagoguery to make the movie emotional And the rest of the movie buckles to that purpose it consists entirely of melodramatic and long family scenes with overloud music at which one is beholden to cry Anyone who actually read Origin Of Species would be vividly aware that there was no breach with God in any of Darwins work to the contrary there was an increased awe and respect and a revolutionary new way of looking at things A good movie about Darwin could be educational thoughtful and deeply inspiring even in a religious sense  but that would contradict the soapopera intentions of this flick This is a flick that is designed to make people wail in contrived sympathy and then feel transformed although unable to understand why it makes fast use of Darwins great name only as marketing clout as one would drop a famous name at a party to create an impression Sad that the sets and costumes are so good production values except for the writing were obviously high See it if you want to weep for the loss of intelligence in American literature,negative
This film should have been only 10 minutes I mean there is really only 10 minute worth of watchable content in this thing I even hesitate to call it a movie The opening credits of the film was somehow promising As the film begins by short comments of the man himself you really rub your hands and stay tuned for more footage from Cohens life Well Nick Cave does a reasonable job covering one of Cohens famous songs The length of Caves performance makes you even more eager to see more of Cohen whose wit and well spoken words have already tickled your fancy But as it turns out Caves performance is only the start of lengthy super boring performances by literally a bunch of no ones who dont even have a minimal attraction to keep you on your seat I mean what does the filmmaker really think fiveminute closeup shots of wanna be singers in a fake concert in Australia What does the filmmaker really think to insult the audience by adding fake applause to these endless nasty performances The film is a perfect torture that shows you very little of what you came to see There is not a single footage of Cohens past In fact except for a few photographs of his early days as a singerpoet there is absolutely nothing If you add up all the minutes that Cohen talks it may not even reach 10 minutes But these 10 minutes are tortuously presented bit by bit in between disastrous camerawork that captures some of the most unattractive people screaming Cohens lyrics If you ever decided to waste your money on this film DONT just throw it in the garbage and at least save your time,negative
I bought this from Blockbuster for 99p The guy behind the counter said the reason it was so cheap was because the disc was scratched to sht but failed to mention that the reason it was so cheap was because the film was a pss poor effort that sucked harder than Paris Hilton in a hotel room home video Talking of home videos since when has it been fair game to release them as films  I mean to say films used to employ actors and technicians and scriptwriters and so on  not any more  just gather your friends and lameo ideas together for the weekend lavish the production with an 800 budget and get someone to fall down the stairs with a Casio keyboard the soundtrack  then slap it on the shelves for some poor sap me to take home in lonely desperation But heres the clincher  I fast forwarded through most of this and tossed it to one side ready for the hammers until the next night while watching a Darren Day horror Hellbreed 199 to take home and keep from a different Blockbuster Now this film made Grim Weekend look like The Exorcist so I slapped Grim Weekend back on to catch up on some of the moments listed on the wonderful IMDb boards that viewers claimed were hilarious Sure enough once I had got over the misery the pain and the horror of realising Grim Weekend was utter chod on toast I could enjoy savour and downright get down to the funny stuff And theres a lot of it Check the boards Then check the flick Hell it might even be worth it AWWWWW CRAP,negative

Silent Night Deadly Night 5 is the very last of the series and like part 4 its unrelated to the first three except by title and the fact that its a Christmasthemed horror flickbr br Except to the oblivious theres some obvious things going on hereMickey Rooney plays a toymaker named Joe Petto and his creepy sons name is Pino Ring a bell anyone Now a little boy named Derek heard a knock at the door one evening and opened it to find a present on the doorstep for him Even though it said dont open till Christmas he begins to open it anyway but is stopped by his dad who scolds him and sends him to bed and opens the gift himself Inside is a little red ball that sprouts Santa arms and a head and proceeds to kill dad Oops maybe he should have left wellenough alone Of course Derek is then traumatized by the incident since he watched it from the stairs but he doesnt grow up to be some killer Santa he just stops talkingbr br Theres a mysterious stranger lurking around who seems very interested in the toys that Joe Petto makes We even see him buying a bunch when Dereks mom takes him to the store to find a gift for him to bring him out of his trauma And what exactly is this guy doing Well were not sure but he does seem to be taking these toys apart to see what makes them tick He does keep his landlord from evicting him by promising him to pay him in cash the next day and presents him with a Larry the Larvae toy for his kid but of course Larry is not a good toy and gets out of the box in the car and of course well things arent prettybr br Anyway eventually whats going on with Joe Petto and Pino is of course revealed and as with the old story Pino is not a real boy Pino is probably even more agitated and naughty because he suffers from Kenitalia a smooth plastic crotch so that could account for his evil ways And the identity of the lurking stranger is revealed too and theres even kind of a happy ending of sorts Wheebr br A step up from part 4 but not much of one Again Brian Yuzna is involved and Screaming Mad George so some decent special effects but not enough to make this great A few leftovers from part 4 are hanging around too like Clint Howard and Neith Hunter but that doesnt really make any difference Anyway I now have seeing the whole series out of my system Now if I could get some of it out of my brain 4 out of 5,negative
The Ghost Train is a treat to those who appreciate the typical 1940s humour It incorporates World War Two into the plot but not as much as I initially believed it would and the characters are a unique blend who play their roles fairly well Askey playing the role of Tommy Gander is what brightens the story up for the parts which could of been portrayed as boring or draggingbr br The story of the haunted station is actually spooky even for present day standards It is unique and the way the characters communicate with each is fantastic to liven up the mystery which is The Ghost Train Gander is basically a nuisance to all the other members while the rest get along fairly well He is always centre of attention and can be dubbed as being annoying but that is by those who do not appreciate 1940s humour His humour is innocent and childish which makes it sweet to watchbr br If it was not for AskeyGander than this film would of been shorter in action enjoyment and the result would be not as effective in my opinion,positive
I had high hopes for this film since it has Charlton Heston and Jack Palance But those hopes came crashing to earth in the first 20 minutes or so Palance was ridiculous Not even Hestons acting or Annabel Schofields beauty or brief nude scenes could save this film Some of the space effects were quite good but others were cheesy The plot was ludicrous Even scifi fans should skip this one Grade F,negative
Saw this movie in my English class this afternoon and was surprised by how bad this version was Dont get me wrong George C Scott was terrific as Scrooge but the rest of the cast fails so very badly Sometimes I couldnt stop laughing at the stupid acting and the repeated line Merry Christmas to everyone Other times I almost fell asleepbr br The movie is based on a Charles Dickens short story about a rich guy who dont think Christmas is nothing but humbug After 30 minutes the rich guy is visited by three ghosts who persuade him to celebrate Christmas after allbr br I can not understand how this movie with a script so bad it must have been written in five minutes can be so wellrated Instead of this piece of garbage I recommend to you the Bill Murray comedy Scrooged That at least was funny,negative
I thought it was one of the best sequels I have seen in a while Sometimes I felt as though I would just want someone to die Stanleys killing off of the annoying characters was brilliant It was such a well done movie that you were happy when so and so died My only problem was in some scenes it looked like someone with a home camera was filming it and it was weird Judd Nelson is cute at least in my opinion and he was excellent in the role as Stanley Caldwell Brilliant movie,positive

Theres an underlying current in all the positive reviews of this movie  its just a brainless comedy dont take it seriously Chillax dude Well thats one point of view The other would be  why are we accepting exactly the same script the same formula and the same unfunny people in all these comediesbr br What you get is a slacker who through some totally unreal circumstances has to change his life always a he overcome a set of circumstances which would only pose a problem to a raccoon or a teenager beat the equally stupid bad guy who is trying to steal the gal he met two days earlier and triumph by remaining a slacker but with more moneyselfesteem On the way somebody does something gross but very illogical This means you the viewer can call someone after the movie and say something like you wont believe it maaann This guy finds the otter drowned in the bucket of diarrhoea the other guy left after he ate laxative brownies Then he shines his shoes with it Hilariousbr br Most of the usual names turn up David Spade and Rob Schneider do unfunny shtick but theyre crrrazzeee characters  a Russian and Im holding my sides a waiter in a vegan restaurant Adam Sandler the king of the brainless unfunny illogical comedy coproduces and some talentless nobody called Dante shows up yet again The US will have to explain to the rest of the world what this guy Dante is famous for cos we are clueless Allen Covert plays a 36 year old which got the biggest laugh of the night from me He was 42 and looked years olderbr br Did I laugh Yes but no more than I would at a TV sitcom and I dont have to pay a penny to watch them Please stop making these movies,negative
I thought it was an extremely clever film I was very pleased with it and truly couldnt ask for more I actually own the film because I didnt return it to someone Which I should do but I really want to keep it due to how much I enjoyed it Also the fact I dont own too many foreign films and this is a first Now I personally love Finnish stuff so that definitely added to how much I enjoyed it But overall its worth watching However if youre not into the whole trying to understand Finnish or read Subtitles bit then this film is not for youbr br 910 for sure,positive
The whole point of making this film one of the earliest and best international color releases of cinematic opera was to make it more accessible to the masses And it succeeded admirably in doing so The general public would not sit still for a love story about two young exotic lovers in ancient Egypt if played by the typical 300 pound over 40 tenor and soprano with the vocal equipment to sing the glorious music properly Hence the visual substitution of the beautiful principals a young Loren handsome Della Marra and a slinky Ms Maxwellwho make the story much more believable giving those not familiar with the plot or the music a better chance at being wooed into the lovely arias who otherwise might not be Altogether an enchanting introduction to one of Verdis great works I remember seeing this when I was in junior high school and it certainly awakened my interest in opera a form with which I was then not well acquainted I still regard this film fondly and would recommend it highly to those who might appreciate the great music accompanied by better than average visuals Luciano Della Marra was a standout as Radames and unfortunately for audiences did not appear in any other films,positive
When I borrowed this movie I wasnt expecting a highquality performance but this was just sadbr br Most of the acting was so unbelievably bad that you couldnt easily get into this movie if you tried Theres nothing quite like seeing a kid announce things like Oh no My Dad is invisible or I wonder what this does in the same monotone that one might announce traffic advisories over the radio with There are some good actors but they are wasted on smaller partsbr br The story is decent though it would be fairly easy to guess considering that there arent too many real plot changes Lots of holes too For example the Dad is invisible and the inventor figures out what part is needed to make him visible again So the boy goes and steals the part from an electronics store Couldnt he just ask his Dad for the cashbr br This shows up in the Comedy category but most of the comedy in this movie was fairly dumb like the Invisible Dad taking off his clothes while invisible and then almost reappearing naked during a meeting or walking around with his head covered at all times Funny at first but it gets oldbr br 25 because it is watchable and its one of those movies that are funny in their own way like the monotone recitation of lines,negative
The Shining starts with Jack Torrance Jack Nicholson driving to an isolated hotel named the Overlook situated high in the Colorado mountains for an interview with its manager Stuart Ullman Barry Nelson about becoming the Winter caretaker Ullman tells Jack that he will be responsible for the basic upkeep of the hotel but will be almost totally isolated from the rest of the world for six months as the harsh Winter sets in Together with his wife Wendy Shelley Duvall  young son Danny Danny Lloyd Jack moves into the hotel  at first everything seems fine its a beautiful hotel absolutely huge  whatever they need is at their disposal However the Overlook hotel has a murky past with a previous caretaker murdering his entire family before committing suicide  Danny has the ability to shine which means he has psychic powers that let him see  hear things ordinary people cant As the days weeks  months begin to pass Jack become more  more insane Danny keeps seeing things  people while Wendy becomes frantic as she doesnt have a clue whats happening to her family as a heavy snowstorm leaves them trapped Jack finally loses itbr br This English production was cowritten coproduced  directed by Stanley Kubrick  is a fine horror film It appears that The Shining is another film that exists in two distinct different versions  the one I will be commenting on is the shorter European cut that runs just under 2 hours in length The script by Kubrick  Diane Johnson is based on the novel by Stephen King which I have not read so I cant compare them goes for psychological horror rather than visual with only one murder during the entire film There are very few characters in The Shining with Jack Wendy  Danny the only ones that really matter since the film concentrates on them almost exclusively you care for them become involved with them  what they go through The pace is somewhat slow but this is one film that didnt feel that long  keeps you interested throughout On the negative side I dont think the reasoning behind Jack going crazy  wanting to kill his family was strong enough to convince me the fact that Jack escapes from the freezer without any explanation bugs me  I dont know if I missed something but that ending didnt make any sense to me whatsoever Im still trying to work out what that picture is all about There is very little in the way of violence or gore a couple of rotten zombie ghosts  someone is killed with an axe but The Shining is a horror film that doesnt need to rely on blood  special effects as it has a gripping story With a budget of about 19000000 The Shining is technically flawless as you would expect from an obsessive filmmaker such as Kubrick the cinematography is brilliant with some fantastic freeflowing  smooth steadicam shots as the camera effortlessly follows the characters around the maze of corridors the sets look absolutely real  instead of clichéd old haunted house themes like dark corners basements  cobwebs Kubrick brings things right uptodate with brightly lit corridors massive open expansive spaces  a modern decor well 80s modern just check that red toilet out The acting is good from everyone involved although as usual in horror films the little kid is highly annoying  Nicholson seems crazy from the very start The Shining is an absorbing film that I enjoyed watching although Im not sure Id watch it again anytime soon For those looking for explosions  fancy special effects you will be disappointed for those looking for a good haunted house type horror with a strong story I definitely think The Shining is for you well worth a watch in my humble opinion,positive
For fans of Troma or the Cyberpunk genre mixed with a little blood shed then this film for you There is a good amount of blood shed within the confines of this film also the effects can be impressionable and awesome The plot is ridiculous and refreshing not being chained down to what we as audiences are expectant of from films these daysbr br Also notable are the little aliens who I found cute All in all its a good film for fans of the genre Also recommended are films such as TetsuoThe Iron Man and Versus for that weird Japanese film approach filled with wonderful obscurity and bloodshed Of course seeing this film you should already have knowledge of the two,positive
This movie deserved a working over on Mystery Science Theater Even though it has nothing whatever to do with King Solomon its worth a watch because it is an unintentional laughriot Really Its worse than Destroy All Monsters Be sure to check out the following the cheesy medallion looks like the Shriners have been here the obviously polyester Norfolk jacket on Allan Quatermain David MaCallums badly done stutter which does draw attention away from his even worse acting the incredibly bad process work on all the monsters the monsters themselves  the hand puppet which menaces the little girl the giant snake that menaces Macallum while he sinks in oatmeal the redlighted eyes on the motorized crabs the amazingly hilarious boat oh brother which appears to be made of plywood mounted on an old sand dredge and looks like a leftover from a JrSr prom Voyage into the Future with the class of 71 the Phoenician city  where they wear Roman Imperial armor but which inexplicably has Egyptian hieroglyphic inscriptions the Phoenicians invented the alphabetcome onand worst of all Macallum and Ekland with her fright wig playing smoochyface oh the horror The best parts are that the intrepid explorers manage to lose the comic Frenchman and the African guy Snuffleupagus or whatever  evidently chose to die heroically rather than be in any more scenes,negative

Yes Georgio is a lighthearted and enjoyable moviecomedy that contains beautiful settings and beautiful music Its not my favorite movie but it is a movie I have enjoyed seeing more than once Some reviewers suggested if one wished to enjoy Pavarotti they would likely be better served by picking up an opera DVD Although a full opera might be a better representation of Pavarottis operatic talents oftentimes an opera requires costumes and has story lines that completely hide the appearance and nature of the person Yes Georgio permits Pavarotti to use his speaking voice and to exhibit a personality and character in ways an opera would notbr br Many reviewers seemed to find the story unbelievable I dont agree Enormously talented people can be both selfcentered and charming  charming enough to captivate intelligent and beautiful people Additionally people who are very different from one other often gain insights about themselves and grow in positive ways from interacting with people who stretch them or take them in directions they might not have chosen on their own Both Georgio and Pamela become more open to unexplored parts of themselves in relationship with the otherbr br Relax and let yourself go into a visually and aurally rewarding film with Pavarotti at the peak of his vocal abilities The ending scenes from Puccinis Turandot alone are worth the time to get there,positive
From the start you know how this movie will end Its so full of clichés your typical NRA member will not even like this movie I give it 2 out of 10 only because of the acting of William Benton I cant believe people voted 6 for this movie Its so biased towards a certain point of view once a thief People arent born bad Neither are they born good They are born with a clean slate Its society parents and education what makes them who they are And if they take the wrong turn somewhere down the line it certainly isnt going to be the American penal system that gets them back on track Anyway avoid this movie like the plague I bet you have better things to do with your time than waste it on this piece of crapbr br ,negative

Watched this film having really enjoyed Gregorys Girl many years ago This was drivel The plot was vaguely distasteful with the teacher and his friend perving over 1415yearold girls in very short skirts Previous commenters seem to think that this doesnt matter but I found it rather nasty If you have children at school then the last thing you want is to think that every youngish teacher is lusting after his pupils We were surprised that the censor let that through Apart from that the film was just a waste of time The script was poor and John Gordon Sinclair trying too hard to recreate his schoolboy image slightly wacky and off the wall Why anyone would want to lust after him in this performance is incredible This film failed on all counts for me Dreadful Please dont waste your time watching it Lifes too short,negative

I love the first and third Beastmasters but this one was an abomination It was almost as horrible as The Never Ending Story 3 for the same reasons They took a fascinating fantasy world of Barbarian tribes farming villages witches supernatural creatures and a cult of religious fanatics using a pyramid and thought it would be funny to mix in our materialistic popculture world of rock  roll sushi I think thats what it was and flashy sports cars These two worlds do not belong together I do not want to see a bunch of ancient barbarian looking people dancing to some rock song on the car radio I have a sense of humor but this is just stupid This is what Hollywood does to good fantasy movies when they run out of ideas Dont give up though the Eye of Braxus is much much better That one I gave a 10 This one Portal of Time I give a 1 Believe me I dont always give such extremely high or low ratings I just tend to comment only such movies,negative
One of the silliest movies of the 1940s an unbearable haunted house comedy with music starring Kay Kyser Kyer orchestra leader and radiostar and eternal college fraternity goofoff was sort of the precursor to Spike Jones hamming it up for his guests and backed up willingly by his merry troupe of musicians Hes hired to play a birthday party in a gloomy mansion the kind where poison darts imported from Africa are framed and hung on the wall The shindig is beset with a creepy judge a scary professor an ominous swami lots of giggly females and enough bad jokes to fill three Bob Hope pictures The songs by Jimmy McHugh and Johnny Mercer are nothing to brag out and neither is overconfident Kyser yukking it up with elbowintheribs material that turns 1940 back ten years  from ,negative

The Thing has to be one of the all time great movies Of course it was ground breaking special effects at the time of its release that impressed me so much back in 1982 it just blew my mind Id never seen anything like that However although the effects themselves made the movie more horrific it was the story itself the music score  the claustrophobic atmosphere of the Anarctic as well as the interaction and tension between the members of the doomed research station that makes it a classic br br Movies dont get any better than this In the opening scene with the the chopper chasing this husky you just assume that it was some bored scientists from some station letting of some steam Yet when you see them continue their chase at the US base you then think that the Norwegians are suffering from some form of advanced or extreme strain of cabin fever Yet this is offset by the menacing opening music score that sets the tempo You just know that something is not right At this point its a mystery until the thing reveals itself br br However the mystery returns because it becomes a sort of Agatha Christie who dunnit  ie ten little Indians movie scifi style as the members dont know which one of their team is really an alien Suspicion continues to go back and forward between them all as one by one they eventually get knocked off or revealed as the alien The mistrust between the station crew is absorbing as the movie progresses until the final showdownbr br After 20 years of advances in computer graphics and film making production the special effects in the Thing dont carry the same weight as it did in 1982 but other than that it holds up very well all round with some great performances by the cast,positive
OK heres what I say br br The movie was excellent I am a huge Nancy fan and I have read all 156 original books and I went on to read more I am now on 96 Beware of villains giving this movie a lower grade than it should have All clues point to a wonderful movie I loved the whole thing So what Nancy is in current time She is still old fashioned like she is in the books People who havent read more than 5 books are complaining about the view of Nancy I have read all of them and I think Emma is perfect and that Nancy was perfect I found parts of the movie spooky I loved the exciting car chases and get aways I loved the clues I solved the mystery myself It was really wonderful I suggest you go see it since people who have been complaining know nothing of A what a good movie is and B about Nancy Drew Go see it It may not be Oscar worthy but its really a good movie,positive
This is a fact that this is the 1st Saudi feature film to be shown in cinema theaters but not in Saudi Arabia for a simple reason we dont have cinema theaters in our large kingdom  not only one cinema theater The government forbidden opening cinema theaters after the Islamic extremists OR the religious police or both asked for closing it in the late 1970s  the early 1980s  accusing the 7th art with encouraging wrong sex relationships and stuff like that  I dont see a powerful reason why we dont open cinema theaters  we have many videos stores throughout the kingdom we watch movies in the TV from some satellite channels we can install the Showtime set channels and after all movies in general seems harmless in many ways  I know many people how go to neighboring countries only to watch a couple of films  I personally went to Bahrain several times only to watch films in theaters because watching it there is big fun unlike watching a movie home Saudis pay the most expensive cinema ticket in the world we travel to watch movies while the rest of the world have cinema theaters around every town This is one of the problems that we are having br br The movie is produced and presented by Rotana Filmed Entertainment which is a major company belongs to the Saudi tycoonprince Alwaleed Bin Talal the 8th richest man in the worldbr br The movies title is a word means literally how are you but it is also a slang means whats up sometimes used as a slang to say bad about something and sometimes is used as a slang to tell someone politely to mind his business  not to interfere in someone elses affairs Anyway I think they meant how are you  whats up in the same time I could be wrong thoughbr br Male actors are from Saudi Arabia like Hisham Abdulrahman who is very famous and has some popularity after winning 1st prize in Arabian realty show more like American Idol he works in some TV programs like the Arabian version of Cash Taxi  the other famous actor is Khaled Sami who is funny and has a very good sense of humor  other actors like Mishal AlMutairi Turki AlYusuf and Ali Al Sabea are less famous and they work on some TV series shows Female actresses are nonSaudis and they did a very good job speaking the Saudi accent  Jordanian actress Mais Hamdan in leading role  Emeriti actress Fatima AlHawsani  not that we dont have Saudi actresses but are few and not that goodbr br A Saudi critic  Rja AlMutairi who writes for Alriyadh Newspaper the most popular newspaper in the kingdom wrote about it saying lets not expect much of the 1st Saudi feature film It was born in unusual circumstances therefore we cant judge it under the usual standards like any other film It is a fact that the movie hit a huge financial success in its 1st opening days only in Kingdom of Bahrain The movie is fresh and is about a Saudi family deals interacts with controversial fresh issues inside the Saudi society like women driving cars the lowshallow thoughts about the arts the guardianship of the society by a certain group  the differences between being conservative and being an extremist The ideas are good but you feel you are lost in the middle of the movie One of the movies advantages is the beautiful music score by Rajeh Dawood which was good but sometimes it doesnt match or express whats in the picture Turki AlYusuf did a great job  his performance was the best alongside with Mais Hamdan  the biggest loser is the leading actor Hisham Abdulrahman who came behind the supporting actors Mishal AlMutairi Ali Al Sabea and Khaled Sami who did a good job within the limits of their roles br br after all  Keif alhal even with all of its disadvantages still an OK movie and it is a very good 1st step of Rotana  and the movie became the speech of people and streets which is a golden goal to make a strong debates inside the Saudi society about movies in general until they become aware of the importance of the 7th art and other artsbr br PS there is another Saudi filmmaker Abdullah Almohaisen claims that he directed the 1st Saudi movie titled Shadows of Silencebr br I havent seen the movie yet  I hope Ive been helpful,negative
Master of Italian horror Dario Argento is called a lot of bad things by nonfans And is deserving of absolutely none of the backlash In fact every time I hear something bad about Argento I think theyre really talking about Michele Soavi He just doesnt get the same amount of attention because his films were never as successful in theaters In fact his best film  1994s Cemetery Man  was probably his least successful Or just didnt get the attention he felt it deserved because after that he left film and went into directing television Hes never gone back So people really dont know how inferior his other films are because by the time theyve seen them theyre already fans of the Italian horror aesthetic Which means you have to accept the fact that they make almost zero sense and are usually very unattractive films This is where The Church stands out from the pack Because visually its so cheap and ancientlooking you can smell the dust But it has its charms too though they are few The camerawork is truly arresting and the music score is hugely elaborate and grandbr br Since Argento is the reasons people have seen Soavis work all I dont know anyone who caught The Church before Argentos Suspiria and Deep Red Soavi is a bit of a hack Sort of like an Italian Mick Garris the utmost example of a director preferring style over substance The flaws of The Church are constant and plenty The film opens with a somewhat interesting prologue showing knights on white horses charging through a peasant village akin to those you see in any Robin Hood adaptation in some longago century These scenes are intense enough energetic and get quickly to the point Then we cut to the present where the films style takes over Yeah the movie is okay to look at And for about 35 or so minutes in the present 1980s whereverItaly the movie is just interesting enough to get us to the slowly revealing horror elements So now we know the purpose of the film is the build up of its horror And its a decent build up for the most part But as the movie approaches the halfway point we realize the movies driving by and nothing is happeningbr br The plot is very simple I think Two people working in a church one as a cataloger of books and the other as a restorer of the buildings wall artwork discover a scroll  scripture that the man thinks will lead them to some kind of buried treasure or priceless artifact that he can sell and get rich off of So he follows his map only to uncover a force underneath the church that has him hallucinate while hes slowly becoming a demon who will make everyone else hallucinate So while he is doing his demonwork someone he passed the force onto kills himself in a manner that traps everyone in the church while the demon contagen spreads onto everyone leaving a Black preacher and the little girl who sneaks out of the church every night to go clubbing as the only 2 people who can stop the plague from spreading beyond the church walls That probably sounds actionpacked and Soavis style is far more lethargic than Argento But never before have I seen an attempted surrealist film this agonizingly boring I kid you not Absolutely nothing happens in the entire film Ive seen expressionistic or impressionistic Im no film school supergrad films before but most of them actually show things happening John Carpenters Halloween for onebr br It follows pretty closely in the footsteps of Lamberto Bavas Demons films since Argento coproduced Were shown to a location where a bunch of people gather one turns into a demon all the others are isolated that person infects everyone except a couple survivors then the demons either get out infecting the world or the survivors get out when the demons die This film puts all those same elements in place Except unlike Argentos work nothing happens Okay a few things do happen But only one bizarre sequence has the panache of Lambertos much more fun Demons films A random womans neck is impaled by a demon using a section of fence he rips out of the floor Whats bizarre about that you wonder It happens in front of about two dozen people What do they do Nothing She dies her head trickles blood in closeup But all those people dont even notice though it happens in plain view and no less than 8 feet away from them Maybe 4 people notice the demon running up to stab anyone he can as he runs toward her so they duck out of the way Shes killed and in the shot after she dies everyone is just sitting around being quiet while a boy plays a saxophone I kid you not Thats what happens Thats more than logically incoherent its plain stupidbr br The scene is suggesting that the woman just sort of disappears and no one saw her death They all just up and forget about it And this 15second thing is absolutely the only event that takes place in the movie Im not saying its the only violence gore or murder we see Its not Its just the only thing we can tell is happening For example in one scene a beautiful woman sees herself in a mirror looking old and ugly She starts clawing the skin on her face off but when she reappears minutes later no scratches People are devoured by fish and their faces are squashed by subway cars But later they turn up as totally unharmed members of a possessed cult in a scene that commits the ultimate horror heresy copying a famous scene from Roman Polanskis 1968 masterpiece Rosemarys Baby the greatest horror film ever made shot for shot Even if Argento did that I would be furious,negative

I was babysitting a family of three small children for a night and their mother gave me this to show for them having just grabbed it at WalMart earlier in the week All three children actually got physically ill while watching it Im pretty sure it was the pizza they ate or something they all had picked up from school but really it could have been this film Absolutely disgusting How any one can produce this caliber of trash is beyond me Fortunately I turned off the film when I noticed the children were not responding and acting strangely For any parents out there I strongly advise you to refrain from letting young children view this movie,negative
Algiers is not a classic it is a perversion of the wonderful original Pepe le Moko directed by Duvivier and starring a much more attractive and charming Pepe Jean Gabin If you want to fully experience the Casbah and the characters in Algiers I recommend you dont even watch this movie and see Pepe le Moko instead for it is much more elaborate more beautifully filmed the lines are not clichéd and the characters adhere much more to reality Furthermore the ending is so dramatic and key to Pepes character that youll find the Algiers version intolerable Although Algiers does an almost excellent job mimicking each scene the acting falls short as does the credibility of the characters Plus the wardrobe is truly breathtaking in all scenes particularly Pepes in the last scene and Gabys at all times but also when shes on the boat Frankly Algiers is cheap as far as imitations go,negative
This is a terrible film and not one scene has an ounce of truthful emotion The characters are uninflected obviously drawn predictable and the story line is obvious and typical Hollywood wish fulfillmentbr br William Holden so sad to see him in this role was 55 when this film was made but hes playing someone in his early 40s and looks like hes in his 60s Kay Lenz was 20 and was scripted to find him irresistibly attractive I think the dog they found by the side of the road was sexier and had more life than their erotic connectionbr br Holdens characterthe same age as Clint Eastwood when he directed this film not coincidentallyis placed with obvious trappings of 60s prehippie cool the bachelor pad the swinging hifi the lunches at Yamashiro But the film is ridiculously uncool a clanging claptrap of old fogies desperately wishing that the free spirits they saw on Sunset and in Laurel Canyon would find them and their big honkin cars sexybr br Ugh Youth culture was never that desperate And I shudder to think that Bill Holden was so desperate for youth that he took this embarrassing part,negative
Seriously where is Al Pacinos Oscar nomination for this one Is it that we take him for granted at this point in his career Pacino here is extraordinary He gives a complex heartbreaking performance as Shylock the Jewish money lender the movie as a whole was quite great with beautiful shots of Venice to look at and a pitch perfect score to listen to the other actors all do a fine job as well but the real reason to see this is Pacino I have seen all the nominated Oscar performances of 2004 and I must say that Pacino was snubbed blame it on the antisemitism associated with the play the lack of campaigning by the studio the late release date with no major push or most likely all of the above in my mind the best performances of the year belong to Jamie Foxx in Ray Don Cheadle in Hotel Rwanda and Al Pacino in The Merchant of Venice,positive
I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Dick Tracy persona This is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story If you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old Dick Tracy bw movies then youre sure to get a kick out of this rendition The pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as its meant to be I personally find Madonnas musical element to be a major part of this filmthe CD featuring her music from this movie is one Ive listened to often over the years its just so well done and performed musically and tuned to that era In my mind Madonnas finest moment both onscreen but especially musically This is sure to bring out the kid in you,positive
I dont hand out ten star ratings easily A movie really has to impress me and The Bourne Ultimatum has gone far beyond that Furthermore this trilogy has come together so nicely that I believe it to be one of the greatest motion picture trilogies of our time Though all three films could not be any more different from the Ludlum novels they still stand as a powerful landmark in cinematic achievement The Bourne Ultimatum made me want to cry that the series was complete yet I could not even attempt to stop smiling for hoursbr br From the moment that the opening title appeared I knew we were in for a ride Paul Greengrass has done it again Everything we love from the previous Bourne films is here once again the action the dialogue and of course the shaky camera However for me that last one was never a problem I think it adds to the suspensebr br I will be back to see this film several times before it is released on DVD simply because it is genius It is a perfectly satisfying conclusion and should stand the test of time as a fantastic movie and altogether an unforgettable trilogy,positive
This movie lacked everything story acting surprise ingenuity and a soul Fifteen minutes in I was staring at the screen saying How could all of these guys get together and consider themselves friends even without the girl Another fifteen minutes in I was praying for as much Amanda Peet as possible When a bad movie quietly rears its ugly head eye candy is a nice consolation But there wasnt much of that Cheated on all fronts,negative
Well I can safely say Im human Wong And I didnt throw up I laughed And laughed If this movie made you puke there is something wrong with you But this movie is incredible I bought it four days ago and have watched it 5 times already The animal cruelty gets my heart but not long enough to be guilty The movie is shocking disgusting and vulgar The acting is horrific What else do you want from a movie I am a diehard cult film maniac Pink Flamingos is awesome It makes Rocky Horror as someone has said look like the teletubbies,positive
I saw this movie on Thursdays night after having a really boring day I had no expectations those I had were rather negative Being that the only movie Ive ever watched Jimmy in is the American version of Taxi with Queen Latifahdont ask why But seriouslythis movie is so cute Drew Barrymore is always sweet but I almost fell in love with Fallons character Why cant I meet a cute nerd like that  Movies like that are excellent Simple sweet and necessary Sunday on a Thursdays Im not even a sports fan but its something about American movies with baseball that fascinates me Probably the fact that we dont have that sport here in Norwaybr br My first comment ever Haha,positive

Being a fan of time travel stories I was surprised that there was no device that sent Russell Johnsons character through time He just appeared in 1865 It was a disappointing part of the episode I enjoyed the premise of the dangers of altering the future by changing the past Other Twilight Zone episodes about time travel such as No Time Like The Past Once Upon A Time etc were more to my liking because of the uses of time travel devices Perhaps if Russell Johnsons character had been the same character he played in Execution it would have been more acceptable to fans like myself As scifi fans know no characters really ever have to die in time travel episodes All sorts of plot twists can be applied in these types of stories That was the only flaw I could comment on for this episode,positive
The team of Merian Cooper and Ernest Schoedsack produced a documentary of 50000 Bakhtiari people and their animals on the Summer migration to winter grazing The basic worth of this film today is as a time capsule of a forgotten people and how they lived during what we in the West knew as the roaring twenties A more drastic contrast could not be imagined Raging river and barefoot mountain crossings are brutally realistic and the animals that disappear under the water do in fact die To make sure that the audience of the time believed that the story took place a signed certificate of authenticity is offered up at the end The version that I saw had fascinating Iranian music that can stand alone and be appreciated without the film Having said all this the film is probably of more value to the anthropologist than the casual viewer in search of a good evenings entertainment The crew had just barely sufficient stock to take the shots that they recorded and there is no fancy camera work resulting from multiple retakes The Western intertitles detract from the experience but are in fact a part of the record since they demonstrate how Hollywood tried to put their spin on the lives of an indigenous peoples lives so that they would be appreciated by the audience of the day Offduty entertainment by desert police becomes a policemans ball The producers went on to make the docudrama Chang 1927 and the totally commercial King Kong 1933 The migration theme is used again in People of the Wind 1976 and in Himalaya 1999 Recommended for those who know in advance what they are getting into  and then highly recommended for them,positive
After seeing this movie I came to the realization that Drew Barrymore is a great actress This movie wouldnt have been watchable without Drew The fact that somebody as attractive as Drew could actually gross me out and she did when she was Josie Grossie Her attempts to transition as the cool girls called it were hilarious especially her trying to dance at the night clubbr br We also had SNL favorite Molly Shannon playing a great part as Anita Josies best friend One of the funniest scenes in the movie was Anita trying to teach the class sex ed This was one of Mollys funniest performances and bestbr br Leelee Sobieski also had a great part and I really felt for her because I know people like her that got tortured like thatbr br This movie is a must see for Drew Barrymore fans because Drew makes the movie,positive
Overall the Dads Army movie is very funny although the humour isnt quite as catchy and sparkly as in the TV and radio series So where does this leave us the viewers If youve never seen Dads Army then the movie is a good way of bringing yourself up to speed and getting hooked on the mad world of Walmington oS The downside is that you might not get it because as I said the humour in the movie is a bit on the stolid sidebr br For Dads Army buffs the movie holds nothing new as the story is more or less a cutup of the TV series but its a unique chance of seeing your favourites in high def as compared to the shitty quality of the BBC video recordingsbr br The movie also features what must be the lamest holdup sequence in the history of the universe I cant make up my mind if thats a positive or a negative though,positive
This movie is the worst movie i have ever seen it is humorous how bad it is the entire time i was watching it i half expected music to start and the doctor starts dancingive seen pornos with a better plot When the raptor was trying to get in the door i think someone was throwing a plastic doll against the door from about 2 feet away But as i said it is so bad you need to watch it so that you can see just how bad it is me explaining it isnt going to do anything compared to if you watch it  i dont recommend renting it but if it comes on TV watch it for about 30min just to see what i mean I couldnt watch more than 30min but if you can sit through the whole thing then you have some good willpower,negative
Steven Seagals films of late have not exactly been good but this is by far the worst since The Patriot The plot makes no sense what so ever it is never clear in what the relationships between the characters are who works for who or who is double crossing who The film is completely disjointed each scene seems to confuse the story further rather than carry it forward Even the action sequences are uninspired and hard to follow Most of the blame must lie at the directors feet for not even understanding the basics of film making but Seagal does not get off lightly as one of the producers of this film he must also share the blame Oh and I havent even mentioned how awful the acting is even by Seagal standards Even as straight to video fodder this is not worth a view even for Seagal fans Give it a wide berth,negative
This movie was bad to say the least The plethora of superb cars are disgraced to have have been showcased in this LAME movie It starts off with a race from LA to Las Vegas to be completed in 1HR 45minin a Ferrari F430 I did that in 1HR 50min in a tiny 4cylinder 140HP 1993 Honda Accord Seriouslythis movie does not do justice to these cars Obviously these writers are just that and probably drive under the speed limit with their hands  10  2 oclock I remember seeing on the news how Eddie Griffin crashed a 15 million dollar Ferrari Enzo going 3040MPH youtubecomwatchvcNVrMZX2kms br br Andthe director ANDY CHENG is THE biggest SELLOUT He brings shame to his own race I wonder just how many people he orally pleased just to break into Hollywood He partook in a movie that portrays Asian Americans in such a negative and FALSE way Asian womencheap money grubbing whores Asian menlosing compulsive gamblers  thugs that get beat all the time  What the heck is all the fear about asians Why the need to always portray them in such a negative connotation I am SO sick of the way Hollywood ALWAYS portrays asians in SUCH a negative and false pretext,negative
This second film is just as interesting as the previous one except that there is no suspense We know what he is going to do and what is going to happen before it is even hinted at on the screen Then the pleasure comes only from the way the various tricks happen and the succession of them We know there will be dynamite in the car that he will lose a wheel that the car will have a crash just to speak of the car And that is what happens Now the details and the particulars are for you to discover them in the film That he may be baited by some dumb woman is obvious and has to come but we know that he has already seen through her and that he knows he is being dragged into a trap Now how is he going to get out of it Thats what you must discover by yourself And dont worry he will get the main trafficker but how is another story A speed boat is no match to our busy beaver on the river We also know when he is going to be wounded They did not know what bulletproof jackets were in those days Its true recently it was discovered that some GIs did not have that kind of equipment in Iraq But what is the meaning of such a film This insistence on hunting the traffickers and this blindness that does not see that it is the prohibition that creates the problem But the film is a constant and perfect illustration that there is no value what so ever that can stand in the way of this moralistic crusade against the forces of evil Why not simply legalize these goods so that they can be properly observed and under surveillance When something is not illegal or pushed out of the way it is all the less fun to use them to do them It is the forbidden or the restricted that is attractivebr br Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris Dauphine University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne  University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines,positive
Spending an hour seeing this brilliant Dan Finnerty and his Dan Band perform their special on Bravo is the most enjoyable hour Ive ever spent watching TV This young man Dan is such an incredible talent as a singer performer and even dancer He can go from the cheesiest of ballad pop songs all of which have only been sung by women to hiphop rock also songs written for women This guy can do anything Ive seen him live at least 11 times so I was not expecting just how well that his show would adapt to a television or film format but all reservations went away instantly when the show started because of Dans overwhelming star qualityDo yourself a favor and watch this or better yet buy it,positive
This movie is another fine example of what Jerry Bruckheimer since about 1997 seems to be best athyping up a movie a year before its release and not coming through with a quality movie Im no film critic but this movie was as predictable as they come Every attempt at a joke every attempt at a touching moment and the pitiful attempt at a love story was exactly what I was predicting in my mind Do yourself a favor and save your money on this one,negative
This movie catches a lot of flak but this is usually based on the horrible looking and covered  clothed version of the film that played US television and has also been issued to death on VHS and DVD buy companies like Alpha Unicorn etc This movie never had a theatrical release in the states although it was picked up by Avco Embassy in 1973 In Spain at the time when there was nudity involved the filmmakers shot two versions one with clothes and one with out The fully uncut English dubbed export print was titled WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS and seems to have been released to home video only in Sweden back in the 80s It can be found on Ebay and the likes and comes highly recommended My guess is Avco cut the film down for a R rated release that never happened In 1974 it was released by Avco to television titled FURY OF THE WOLFMAN and the clothed version was used for this TV print Cut to 12 years later and FURY OF THE WOLFMAN pops up on home video on the Charter label This version appears to be what Avco was going to release back in 73 Its the uncovered version with some nudity that would never pass on TV or in a PG movie There are several scenes on the Charter tape that play out with nudity that are clothed in the TV print  the source for all those dollar Duds and VHS editions  But a comparison to the fully uncut WOLFMAN NEVER SLEEPS reveals that 2 scenes are cut on this version  spoilers in next paragraph  The scene where Ilona has Waldermar chained to the wall and whips him after he transforms into the werewolf is incomplete After whipping him into submission she starts to remove her clothes and begins making love to the werewolf The werewolf responds positively to these sexual shenanigans too This scene certainly ranks as one of the most unusual in the history of horror films and is a delirious treat Its not graphic but the implied bestiality was too much for US audiences or more likely the MPAA Ilona is desperately in love with Waldemar and could not possess him hence her whole scheme to mind control Waldermars wife and involve her in an affair She wanted to wreck his marriage and she accomplishes this while Waldemar is in Tibet Unfortunately he returns a werewolf but this does not slow her down a bit If she cant physically have him as a man she loves him enough to have sex with him as a werewolf This also helps explain the later scene where the werewolf beds down with a woman he spots getting naked before bedtime while peeping through her window This scene is presented sans nudity in the covered version and really makes no sense In the uncut version it would seem Ilonas affections have made the werewolf horny and in need of release so he rapes the first woman he can after escaping The other cut is a complete scene of Waldemar in bed with Karen and she is seen naked A very similar bedroom scene was cut out of the US version of WEREWOLF SHADOW  WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN  as well The film does have its problems though for certain The director was drunk the bad stand in for the werewolf at points the atrocious English dubbing the inclusion of sequences from the first Waldemar film MARK OF THE WOLFMAN aka FRANKENSTEINS BLOODY TERROR and the grotesque overuse of that films music score throughout etc but seen in its original widescreen format and uncut  ie WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS  it is one of the wildest and most outrageous of the Daninsky werewolf series with a plot line unmatched in its everything but the kitchen sink approach The cut  clothed pan and scan full screen copies of this film do it no favors and unfortunately thats the version almost everyone commenting on the film have seen The film carries a 1970 copyright and Id bet the 1972 release date on the IMDb is incorrect The film precedes WEREWOLF SHADOW  aka WEREWOLF VS THE VAMPIRE WOMAN  in the series and was certainly released before WEREWOLF SHADOW The ending of WEREWOLF NEVER SLEEPS  FURY OF THE WOLFMAN dovetails directly into the opening of WEREWOLF SHADOW offering concrete evidence of this Sadly a complete version of this may never get a decent release A perfect release would be the uncut English version but in Spanish with English subtitles The English dubbing severely hurts the movie But any Spanish language version would reflect the covered version as shown in Spain during the Franco era where nudity was verboten,positive
Though this may not necessarily be a socalled classic film by todays standards its still worth seeing The main reason why is because after experiencing this film you get the feeling that youve also experienced the countercultural idealism of the 60s no matter however good or badbr br I happened to see this film in an English literature class at SUNY Geneseo and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60s icons the film is far from being simply thrown togetherbr br My point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused the film has done its job its conveyed a desolate view of the future that leaves you feeling unsure and angry It was perhaps this same feeling that the film sought to explore in the youth it exemplifiedbr br As such Zabriskie Point may not tell a very good or interesting story and at the same time its characters may be onesided and predictable However it also conveys so well this sort of clichéd rebellious desire to get out of the existence which both Mark and Daria must share Even the antiestablishment students are as inauthentic as the govt they rebel against,positive
This movie was really bad First they didnt even follow the facts for it Half of the movie was made up and it was more about the deputy whose mother was one of Ed Geins victims The acting was horrible except for the guy playing Ed Gein but its not hard to mess up playing a weird guy though i think it was horrible i gave it a three because they started it off with actual crime photos that was the best part of the movie As soon as the introduction of the movie was finished the movie went downhill The writer of this movie tried to spice it up but it didnt need to be The story of Ed Gein is interesting enough without falsifying information,negative

I have seen this movie about 4 times and every time I am impressed with the Second Camera Assistants work Seems trivial but there is something very professional knowledgeable and talented there The movie as a whole suffers from other problems as stated by other comments The significance so the issues being approached are as relevant today as it was 40 years ago The acting is a bit strained but the work of the Second Camera Assistant is stellar This person needs to get back into the business  perhaps directing What is this person waiting for I will be watching and waiting and cheering from the sidelines Bob,positive
The only previous Gordon film I had watched was the kiddie adventure THE MAGIC SWORD 1962 though I followed this soon after with EMPIRE OF THE ANTS 1977 he seems to be best remembered however for his scifi work of the 1950sbr br Anyway I happened upon this one in a DVD rental shop hadnt I noticed Orson Welles unmistakable figure on the sleeve I probably wouldnt even have bothered with it  since I know the film under its original title NECROMANCY Id seen a still from it on an old horror tome of my fathers the actors presence in a film about diabolism seemed like a great idea which couldnt possibly miss but the end result  particularly in this bastardized edition  is a disaster I honestly felt sorry for Welles who looks bored and rather than in his deep and commanding voice he mutters the inane demonic invocations almost in whispers br br The plot is basically yet another retread of ROSEMARYS BABY 1968 a couple is invited to a remote community under false pretenses and soon discover themselves to be surrounded by diabolists The girl played by Pamela Franklin ostensibly has supernatural powers passed on from her mother who appears intermittently throughout to warn her  though as delivered in an intense manner through clenched teeth the latters speeches end up being largely incoherent and the fount of immense hilarity every time she appears and is expected to revive Welles deceased young son from the dead For what its worth Franklin  a genre regular right down from her debut performance in THE INNOCENTS 1961  isnt bad in her role which requires some nudity and experiences several semieerie hallucinations during the course of the film hubby Michael Ontkean however isnt up to the challenge of his John Cassaveteslike character Some of the other girls look good as well  notably Lee Purcell whose belated decision to help Franklin in escaping from town eventually proves her undoingbr br Events come to a head in an incredibly muddled climax which sees the Satanists ultimately turning on Franklin and have her take the revived boys place in the coffin thats gratitude for you While the added scenes do stick out the hilarious opening ceremony and other wouldbe erotic embellishments the overall quality of the film would have still been poor without them then again this particular version is further sunk by the tackedon electronic score  which is wholly inappropriate and cheesy in the extreme,negative
I have to say that the events of 911 didnt hit me until I saw this documentary It took me a year to come to grips with the devastation I was the one who was changing the station on the radio and channel on TV if there was any talk about the towers I was sick of hearing about it When this was aired on TV a year and a day later I was bawling my eyes out It was the first time I had cried since the attack I highly recommend this documentary I am watching it now on TV 5 years later and I am still crying over the tragedies The fact that this contains one of the only video shots of the first plane hitting the tower is amazing It was an accident and look where it got them These two brothers make me want to have been there to help,positive

As an indie filmmaker I try to at least make a decent film  This piece of ____ was beyond low budget It was shot on video and not 24P miniDV at least The look and feel of this was just baaaad I met the director a few years ago at ShowBiz Expo in LA and he was talking about that book Filmmaking for dummies that he was putting together I thought this little video was going to be something but I guess I was wrong He could have brought the value up a little by shooting 16mm film instead of that awful video The plot was stupid as well as the acting and all the fake green screen and sound and the whole nine yards I had a choice tonight to rent any movie and made the wrong choice Damn I did buy JoyRide which was a hell of a movie Maybe the director should read real motion picture books on filmmaking and not try to cut corners when trying to make a low budget flick Maybe he should learn from the masters who made Night of the living dead and The Evil Dead and Chain saw massacre just to name a few of the all time low budget great hits This is one video that should have stayed dead I cannot call it a film because he did not use film,negative

No one in this movie has very much to do This is probably the longest 65 minutes Ive ever spent watching a movie The makeup effects on the pianist with macromeglia are pretty good but thats the only thing that keeps this from being rate a 1 The doctors assistant goes through extreme mood swings from passivity to hysteria in seconds and then seems to forget where she was in the next scene The director assembled a lot of the right ingredients for a maddoctor movie but somehow forgot the skeleton of a story to hang them on Unless you know someone in the cast or crew I wouldnt recommend even sampling this one,negative

For such a great classic tale the setting location Grendel was disappointing As a writer I blame the script which completely lacked dramatic tension The rubric of the club story is useful and would have provided a new take on the literary classic For some weird reason that rubric was dropped early on To know this was shot in 21 days says to me rushed and it unfortunately shows Now well have to wait for the Hollywood version on the big screen I word on FX I can tolerate really crappy CGI but the script has to rock and this one was just too slow spartan and lacking in drama Id blame it on the actors but since I know writing more than acting Ill pick on my colleague,negative
After reading the book Heart of Darkness the movie did not do it justice The movie puts the book to shame and anyone who has not experienced the book would frown upon the story and plot because it was portrayed so poorly by the movie In the film the characters and set were just some of the let downs that occurred in the movie The director left out so many important and interesting aspects of the book that made it one of the best literary works ever madebr br Of course any book is better than the movie but these werent even comparable Joseph Conrad as a writer was brilliant in vocabulary and the cleverness of the written word The movie doesnt even start to show any of this Some of the very important and influential scenes from the book were completely left out like how Kurtz was not in the boat when he died Also when Marlow went to deliver the news to Kurtzs intended she reacted differently in the movie rather than the book Another major difference was that Marlow saw the picture of the lady that was blindfolded at the end of the movie not at the beginning like the book This was influential on how the audience perceived Marlow and the movie totally messed that upbr br The book was so fine tuned on what every location looked like but the scenery in the movie was a let down There was a bunch of cheesy fake backgrounds and to compliment a bunch of bad actors to go along with it There was one exception to the awful actors and that would be Isaach De Bankolé who played Mfumu His character was depicted the best Though the movie wasnt that great I still would recommend it ONLY if you have read and understood the book very well That way you can see what the differences are in the movie and book and contemplate them If you have not read the book I do not recommend the movie because it is a boring lifeless mess I loved the book so you should definitely read it and enjoy it,negative
The problem with The Killer Elite is that just by seeking this film out and investing time to watch it you are putting more effort into the experience than many of its principals did particularly director Sam Peckinpahbr br The already volatile Peckinpah was heading into rough weather with this film According to at least one biographer this was where he became acquainted with cocaine Add to that his binge drinking and its no wonder things fell apartbr br Its a shame because the concept behind the film is a good one and the first ten minutes promise much Mike Locken James Caan and George Hansen Robert Duvall are private contractors who do a lot of dirty work for the CIA They move quick live well and seem like the best of friends  then something happens to shatter their brotherhoodbr br An opening scene shows them blowing up a building  why exactly we arent told par for the course in terms of this films murky motivation But the implication is these guys hurt people and dont really care  antiheroes much like the Wild Bunch of Peckinpahs notsolongago An opening title tells us they work for ComTeg then adds with obvious tongue in cheek the thought the CIA might employ such an organization for any purpose is of course preposterous Thats a pretty clever way of letting the audience know all bets are offbr br Add to that a traditionally strong Peckinpah backup cast including Burt Young Gig Young and Peckinpah regular Bo Hopkins in the plum role of a madman who cant pass up an opportunity to be shot at for 500 a day and you only wish that the scriptwriters including the celebrated Sterling Silliphant tried to do something more with the story than turn it into a platform for lazy oneliners and bad chopsocky knockoffs An attempt at injecting a dose of liberal social commentary is awkwardly shoehorned in Youre so busy doing their dirty work you cant tell who the bad guys are someone tells Locken as if either he or we need it pointed outbr br Worse still are Peckinpahs clumsy direction and sluggish pacing Were 40 minutes into the film before we get our first battle scene a completely chaotic collection of random shots where a bunch of people we havent even met before are seen fighting at San Francisco Airport their battle intercut with a conversation in an office suitebr br By the end of the film whats left of the cast is having a battle inside a fleet of mothballed Victory Ships ninjas running out in the open to be gunned down while Caan tosses off one liners that undercut any hint of real suspense Lay me seventofive Ill take the little guy he wisecracks just before a climatic samurai duel between two ninja warriors  from China which we all know is the land of the Ninja The battle takes place in San Francisco but surprisingly no Mounties arrive to break things upbr br Caan is much better in smaller scenes like when Locken recovering from some nasty injuries is told by one of his bosses played by a smooth Arthur Hill that hes been Humptydumped by the organization Caan refuses to stay down and his recovery scenes though momentumkilling for the movie feature fine acting from him and Amy Heflin Vans daughter as a supportive nurse Caan was one of the 1970s best actors and his laconic byplay with Heflin Duvall Hopkins and both Youngs give Killer Elite real watchabilitybr br But you dont watch Killer Elite thinking about that You watch it thinking of the film that got away,negative
This film wasnt programmed in Italian cinemasI have seen it at a manifestation called fantafestivalI find it terrible because some scenes seems like music videos chaotic and dark the use of fluorescent colors is ridicule and theres no suspence in the film Music is completely out of the story and I dont have words to describe the visual effectsIf you look at the first scene the film seems to be interesting but a few minutes later it becomes busyThe story is interesting but the development needs a complete review,negative
If youre not old enough to remember Yoram Globus and Menahem Golan heres the rundown  Theyre a couple of film producers and finaciers from Israel who set up the Cannon film company in the early 1980s  The only Israeli to get a worse press than these two was Menachim Begin  Begin probably deserved the bad press but Globus and Golan were a god send to film makers because no matter how bad your script was theyd happily fund your movie and would normally employ directors who couldnt direct and actors who couldnt act  In fact you often got the impression that people would just walk up to Yoram and Menahem ask them for some money and theyd oblige without seeing the film makers resume  If only producers nowadays were so trustingbr br THE YOUNG WARRIORS isnt a Cannon film but Globus and Golan did finance it and it has their signature all over it  Its badly directed  badly acted  badly edited but its the script that jumps out and attacks you with its awfulness  It starts with a bunch of high school jocks getting involved in all sorts of zany pranks  in fact the first 20 minutes of the movie plays out like a sex comedy and its something of a shock when THE YOUNG WARRIORS turns into a vigilante movie  But its not just any type of vigilante movie like EXTERMINATOR 2 or DEATH WISH 3  Notice a connection  Theyre both sequels and theyre both vigilante movies made by Cannon films   no siree this is a laughably bad vigilante movie about pretty boy high school jocks and their poodle going on a mission to wipe out scumbags  This film is proof that Globus and Golan were giving money to people regardless of their film making abilities and you have to worry about people who seem to spend their entire reserves on making movies set entirely around vigilantes,negative
I picked this movie up because it sounded like a pretty decent flick and Ive always been a fan of Foreign films However for someone who likes movies I was surprised at how much I hate hate HATED this moviebr br Although it does aim to expose the lives of young lowerclass men in Lima and to an extent it does succeeed the characters are hopelessly shallow and the audience winds up having absolutely no feelings whatsoever for thembr br Although the story chiefly revolves around M he rarely ever speaks and his dialouge is at best amazingly dry and dullbr br  Warning Some small spoilers br br Basically the story revolves around a young man named M who has been searching for jobs but without success He does gain employment twice but quits because theyre not for him when youre poor the last option you have is to be picky Some amount of time is spent with his friends whos idea of fun is to rape a little 14 year old steal crappy tires off a piece of shit car for a dime sack of weed and several other slightly retarded activitiesbr br Ms friend comesup with a plan to make 25000 a piece and move to the US by running Cocaine to Miami When the drug lord gives them a job were treated to an extremely lame scene of the three friends buying clothes at the mall with some music playing in the background We see them trying different clothes on like little girls given 200 to shop get there hair cut and then strutting off looking like slick gangsters one character Carlos will from this point on wear sunglasses ALWAYS even at nightThe day before they leave the leader of the group leaves to speak with the drug lord leaving M and his friend to be dumb They party up take several samples of the drugs theyre suppose to run and break into thier old school acting like animals and smashing everything in sightbr br The movie ends when M tries calling his girlfriend who hangs up on him The friends then proceed to set the pay phone on fire which brings out a bunch of kids and some old man with gun M and Carlos friend in charge of the drug run shows up on his motorcycle and wants them to leave with him now Then he takes off by himself and gets shot by that old man The police show up and arrest M and his friends but not the man who shot the guy and cover thier dead friend up with newspapers as music plays and it fades to creditsbr br  End Spoiler br br I even watched this movie a second time hoping to see some subtle redeeming factor for it but I did not A complete waste of 102 minutes Although I must give it credit for being straightforward and not shying away from disturbing elements the casting acting and overall direction still leaves much much much to be desiredbr br IMHO if youre interested in a movie that explores the issues this one was suppose to go rent City of God Cidade de Deus instead Avoid this trash at all costs You have been warned,negative

In a nutshell this is a cookie cutter romantic comedy that really WANTS and TRIES to be something more It wants to be Harold and Maude Annie Hall The Graduate It wants to be deep and human It has interesting camera shots lighting music editing all of which give it the feel of an important movie The dialog is smart  at times There are some laugh out loud momentsbr br But heres what keeps it from ultimately being anything more than a formulaic latenightcable inflight timekiller br br 1 David Schwimmer  how many times can Joe sadsack puppy dog stare blankly into space with his jaw hanging open before it starts to get annoying Maybe some drool would have helpedbr br 2 Gwenneth Paltrow  shes really flat here and not just in the chest Her role is supposed to be this lively nice caring girl who just keeps getting herself into wrong situations is very confused as a result and that is why a sadsack loser like Schwimmer has any chance with her But Gwenneth plays her very dull Combine this with puppydog droolface above and you have very little chemistry to care aboutbr br I kept picturing someone else in this role  Kate Hudson for example br br 3 The script and the plot  the stuff that happens just basically doesnt ring true all the problems get wrapped up in the end with such a neat and tidy bow on top that it seems like a whistle blew and the script writers just said oops time to wrap it up got a train to catch So they pulled out the Hollywood formula book checked off all the boxes and went home,negative

wow this is the worst movie ever the only reason i signed up for IMDb was so i could complain about this movie i have never walked out of a theater or stoped a DVD but i almost stopped this one and i should have but i watched it all the way to the end just to get let down again with an absolutely terrible ending wow if this is all that wes craven can produce his time is long up Ive never seen the first one and will never after watching this its terrible acting with a terrible plot hey looks someone is shinning a mirror at us lets go check it out and the sad part is that when this movie came to DVD it was completely checked out at blockbuster forever so i feel bad for all the people that saw this junk,negative
If youre researching UFO facts then this video is very important The meat of the video is the comments made by Buzz Aldrin He is without a doubt from the best of America Trained to be objective honest and factual in his reports Many Astronauts from America of all eras have reported some kind of contact or UFO observance and there are videos from some of those missions At the very least something has happened that requires further objective ongoing investigating I think this testimony from Buzz Aldrin shows that it is possible that other worlds may be interested in our progress Like all supposed documentary video this one may be slanted but it does contain further information and opinions from an accomplished American hero Those dont come along every day So the fact that some people arent interested in details should not detour your from viewing this video If nothing else it is interesting and I recommend you watch with an open mind,positive
As much as I like big epic pictures  Ill spare you the namedropping  its great to kick back with a few beers and a simple action flick sometimes Films where the plot takes a backseat to the setpieces Films where the dialogue isnt so cleverly written that it ties itself in endless knots of purple prose There are HUNDREDS of films that fit the bill but in my opinion Gone In Sixty Seconds is one of the better onesbr br Its an update of the movie that shares its name It also shares that pictures ethos but not quite its execution Whatever was great about the original has been streamlined Whatever was streamlined was also amped up thanks to a bigger budget Often these kinds of endeavours are recipes for complete disaster  see the pugugly remake of The Italian Job for one that blew it  but here thanks to a cast of mostly excellent actors Sixty succeedsbr br The plot and much of the dialogue isnt much to write IMDb about Often youll have scenes where the same line of dialogue goes back and forth between the actors each of whom will voice it with different inflections A lot of people found this annoying I find it raises a smile Each actor gets a chance to show off his or her definition of style here with Cage Jolie and Duvall leading the pack of course and it should be noted that its also amusing to see Mrs Pitt not given first billing here The chemistry between good ol Saint Nick the stalwart see date of review and Angelina leads to a couple of nice momentsbr br The villain is not even a little scary  Ive seen Chris Eccleston play toughguy roles before so I know he can handle them but I think he was deliberately directed to make his role inconsequential as not to distract from the action We know the heroes are going to succeed somehow were just sitting in the car with them enjoying the ride I think a lot of these scenes were played with tongue so far incheek that it went over the heads of a lot of people giving this a poor rating In fact I wouldnt have minded some fourthwall breaking winks at the camera its just that kind of moviebr br All this style and not so much substance  something that often exhausts my patience if not executed just so  would be worthless if the action wasnt there And for the most part it is Wonderfully so Ive noticed that it seems to be a common trend to be using fastcut extreme closeup shots to direct action these days I personally find this kind of thing exhausting I prefer movies like this where the stunts are impressive enough to not need artificial tension ramping by raping tight shots all the time Ive been told that Cage actually did as many of the car stunts as he could get away with without losing his insurance in real life I mean  his character clearly doesnt care and it shows The man can really move a vehicle and this is put to good use in the slowburning climatic finale where he drives a Mustang into the ground in the most outlandish  and FUN  way possiblebr br So yes this movie isnt an epic lifeaffirming post911 picture with obligatory social commentary effort The pacing is uneven some of the scenes could have been cut and not all the actors tow the line But car movies rarely come better than this So if you hate cars why are you even reading these commentsbr br Id take it over the numerous iterations of The Flaccid And The Tedious guess the franchise any day 710,positive
I think that deep down in the darkest slimiest part of their heart everyone likes Jerry Springer just a little bit While his show is undeniably offensive and stupid it also gives us a chance to see that relatively speaking most of us have it real good When you look at the trailer park livin dollar whiskey drinkin incest lovin people on the Springer show it makes even your worst day seem like a walk in the park Jerry is performing a public service and we should be grateful He ditched a political career to host the show just for usbr br What we should not be grateful for in any way is the piece of garbage movie Ringmaster Ringmaster shows what life is like for people who wind up being guests on the show or so they would like us to think The movie follows the prerequisite Springer story line Love triangles One triangle involves Connie her daughter Angel and her husband Rusty The other involves Starletta Vonda and Demond When the two hapless groups meet up in LA their lives intertwine and collide headon all culminating in an explosive episode of the Springer show Its like what Short Cuts would be if Robert Altman had had a severe crack habitbr br Ringmaster is true to the show as it is stupid and offensive from start to finish It also makes me very glad that I dont live in the squalor its characters do But the movie has a problem Its billed as a comedy but it just isnt very funny What laughs there are to be had are few and far between Maybe some people watch this and laugh nonstop If you think blow jobs and rape are funny well then I guess youre one of those folks Personally I laughed two or three times and spent the rest of the movie in utter awe of the agonizing horrors of whitetrash lifebr br The Jerry Springer Show just isnt meant to make the leap from TV to the silver screen Whats funny in an hour long show less when you count commercials isnt necessarily going to be funny in a ninety minute movie Movies have to tell a story and thats something else Ringmaster has trouble with The story is threadbare There are so many plot holes and continuity errors that any attempt at telling a cohesive narrative is quickly put asunder And even if there werent such problems how much fun can you pull out of a story of stereotypical people in a stereotypical story Even the Hollywood formula couldnt make this better Ringmaster is so bad it even screws up the best part of the Springer show the Final Thought Somehow even the smartest and simplest aspect of the show wound up blowing harder than the slutty women the film is built aroundbr br The worst offender in all of this is Springer himself Hes such a bad actor that he cant even play himself convincingly Watching Springer play Springer is sad Its like he was going for a What if Woody Allen played Jerry Springer vibe and he failed Miserably He went to the trouble of producing this disaster the least he could do is try to make it just that much betterbr br Not that Im saying everyone else in this movie put in an award worthy performance Just the opposite They all suck Not so surprisingly no one in this movie went on to greatness The best any of them was did was Molly Hagan landing a job on a Nickelodeon sitcom Apparently Nickelodeon has no problem with hiring a woman who starred in the most vile film of the 90s to star in a childrens program It makes you wonder what kind of things the other adults on that channel have done in their pastsbr br Here are my Final Thoughts What we have here is a group of people with no self respect and a man with money to burn who have met and put their resources together to produce a film that shows how much they hate themselves and how little they think of the intelligence of their viewing audience Should we accept people who make movies that treat us like severely braindamaged lumps of goo I say no Somewhere out there in this crazy mixed up world there is a perfect movie for each of us We just have to keep looking for it Until next time take care of yourselves and your loved ones And dont ever watch Ringmaster,negative
What I liked best about this featurelength animated film from 1941 is the great feel it gives for the early 1940s Its the songs the clothing automobiles buildings lingo of the day etc You feel like youve stepped back into timebr br From reading some of the reviews here I see this was a hardluck film being released a couple of days before the Pearl Harbor attack Wow no one would be interested in going to the movies for a featurelength cartoon during those eventful and shocking days Im sure Too bad because the folks missed some nice animation would have really impressed back then almost 70 years ago The colors are nice drawings are good and story involving as we root for the bugs led by Hoppity and and his beautiful girl Honey to make it happilyeverafter and out of harms way Its also about all of them finding a grassy spot they can live and not worry about humans trampling thembr br There is a nasty villain though  C Bagley Beetle  and two of his henchmen Those helpers Swat The Fly and Smack the Mosquito are comedians complete with their Brooklynese accents The story is a familiar one where a nasty old man wants to marry the sweet young thing and uses unscrupulous means to force her hand The good guy meanwhile has the decked stacked against him but in the very end of course prevailsbr br My favorite part  this will sound worse than what it was  was when goodguy Hoppity got temporarily electrocuted and he danced in blackandwhite That was fantastic animation br br You know its a good thing I didnt see this as a very little kid I would have been afraid to play outside and squash all those nice bugpeople You never know what or who is in that grass beneath your feet,positive

I suppose Im supposed to take something like this with a grain of salt These laboratory movies and yes they spend a lot of time in the laboratory always fail in one dimension there is an understanding that single people fooling around have uncovered secrets beyond the comprehension of anyone to this time Of course they pay a price because their experimenting has the same shortcomings that Dr Frankensteins did There is always something they didnt anticipate There are so many things from pure science to fashion for young ladies to outrageous cover ups that dont work here The young woman is certainly fetching and the doctor cant help himself but he could have been a little bit discreet or even made an effort to shelter what he was doing Things go wrong and because of this intellect she gains tremendous power including an understanding of how she came to be Rock Hudson looks pretty fit here He never quite makes it in this role however It wanders all over with lots of clichés and silliness which diminishes the basic issue Once she has her revenge a more suitable thing would be for her to wander off and allow him to seek her out and destroy her in some grand way,negative

The brilliant thing about Withnail  I is that it captures that not long left college and life could go either way moment along with all its other finery Freebird is something for those who probably never considered higher education and just went straight to work aged 1516 I know some of the broad sheets stuck the knife into this film when it came out in Cinemas but i saw it at a packed house in Hailsham and everybody seemed to really enjoy it I grew up in the forest of Dean and this took me straight back to my mushrooming and dope days had some great mates  hate to think what theyre all up to now  probably running the local council Ive watched it a couple of times on DVD and already i see the film as an old mate that will stay forever as part of my collection how can i like this film and the Dambusters  doesnt seem right somehow I certainly edge towards the second half of this film and i think the social interacting scenes with the locals are brilliantly done I like the mix of the three lead characters and there really is some lovely writing in here along with some very quotable lines and dare i say a good smattering of integrity I have tried to obtain the soundtrack but it has not been released shame as its a corker Someone told me it was originally a stage play not quite sure how that worked but im sure it was fun I liked the little Shakespearian touchesreferences that seem to crop up throughout the film also spotted the Dylan Thomas ref as well and like all little gems there will always be little things to discover like the final scene giving a nod to Easyrider as they start theyre next journey All in all a genuinely unpretentious piece of film making love it,positive

The Honkers is probably Slim Pickens best performance of all time When we were shooting everyone connected with the production figured that Slim was Academy Award material Unfortunately United Artists had a James Bond picture in release at the same time and did not devote much attention to The Honkers I personally feel this film was underrated by most critics Sam Peckinpaws Junior Bonner was out at the same time and seemed to impress the critics more than our film Also Cliff Robertson had a rodeo film out a few months before our release and that might have hurt us too The picture is worth watching if just for the rodeo footagesome of the best ever filmedshot by James Crabbe The director and my cowriter Steve Ianat died a few weeks after the pictures release cutting short a promising career and leaving behind his lovely wife Sally his daughter Gaby and newborn son Stefan Please give this movie a shot Im betting that youll say it was well worth while I thank anyone who has taken the time to read this Stephen Lodge,positive
Last years remake of The Hills Have Eyes was one of the better attempts to update the vaguely exploitational horror flicks of the 1970s for a new audience Alexandre Aja allowed for an admirable degree of character development and when the violence started it was mean and savage and all carried out in a landscape of impeccable photography and production design I was one of the few people who actually thought that it was better than the original and looked forward to a second visit to the particularly dark and cruel world of the savage desert mutantsbr br The Hills have Eyes 2 released just a year after the original seems a rushed and illconceived attempt to cash in on the franchise with little thought to quality Jonathan Cravens screenplay could have been written in a weekend and given the speed with which this movie made it into cinemas probably was It falls back on every hackneyed genre cliché in the book while offering absolutely nothing new to the desert mutant mythology I always let out a groan of disappointment when a sequel replaces civilian characters with the military Soldiers are always so lazily written and never fail to thoroughly bore with crude caricatures of strutting macho bullshit In my mind Aliens was the only movie to successfully make such a transition due to James Camerons talent not simply for directing the best action sequences around but never forgetting that an audience has to care about the people being butchered He was also ably assisted by some genuinely talented actors With The Hills have Eyes 2 its clear that video director Martin Weisz is no James Cameron and the cast of television bitparters havent the talent or even the inclination to turn their cardboard cutout characters into anything approaching living breathing human beingsbr br Needless to say every character is a broad and generic cliché They act in dumb and illogical ways making dumb and illogical decisions that lead them to predictably dumb and illogical deaths The latter half of the movie becomes just another tedious chasedthroughdarkcorridors scenario The Descent on which Sam McCurdy coincidentally also worked as cinematography proved that even this most derivative of sequences can still be carried out with genuine originality and suspense but we see no such innovation herebr br The Hills Have Eyes 2 is just a very lazy movie devoid of any suspense tension or surprise with not a single individual involved remotely interested in producing anything of quality Its a tame and tired excuse for a sequel and deserves to spend the rest of its life in a Blockbusters bargain bin,negative
I went to this movie expecting a concise movie relating the effect the Son of Sam had on the society I didnt expect Spike Lee to forcefeed me more garbage on racial tension mobjustice or the inability of the common citizen to make a choice under pressure by peers Lee has presented an extreme opinionbr br The entire movie could have been more effective if in a 90min format with more focus less tangential subplotsbr br Dont even bother renting the video unless you passionately enjoy Spike Lee in such a case the theatre is worth it This is not an escapist movie,negative
I dont mean to sound pretentious here but to call this the next cult classic is yet another example of the lowering standards filmmakers have for themselves This movie is an offense to everything we hold sacred and not in the good artsy  way of offending This film becomes the archetype for PAINFUL dialogue delivered by even more pathetic actors,negative
I am amazed at the amount of praise that is heaped on this movie by other commentators To me it was rather a disappointment especially the combination of historical facts fantasy and the main characters internal turmoil does not work at all in Vonneguts book Slaughterhouse Five and even in George Roy Hills adaptation for the screen it does Credibility is often overstretched Too many questions are left open Did I miss some central points Or did I fail to spot the lines that supposedly connect the dots br br A boy called Campbell Jr grows up in upstate New York At home his father has many technical trade papers and one book It has photographs of heaps of dead bodies in it The boy leafs through the book his dad doesnt like his doing that What should this tell me The family moves away from upstate New York to Berlin BANG It is 1938 the boy is a married man in Berlin and a theater playwright What kind of plays does he write In what language Is he successful His wife is an actress and looks glamorous The parents move back to the USA and invite their son to do the same He does not Why Because having grown up in Germany he feels more German than American Because he is successful Because his wife is Because he likes his life there Because he likes the Nazis Because he is just plain lazy and doesnt like change Dont ask mebr br Possibly the man just does not care is not interested in politics is a kind of an existentialist He states that he is deeply in love with his wife He speaks of his Republic of Two meaning he and his wife There is little to no evidence proving his love for his wife in the movie it much more seems a Republic of Onebr br On the request of an American agent Campbell Jr agrees to broadcast anti Semitic Nazi hate propaganda to American listeners as a device for transmitting encrypted messages to American authorities who read between the lines The crucial meeting with the agent on a Berlin park bench is short unexciting and anti climactic the decision to play along comes pretty easily with no explanation the rise up to broadcaster seems to be uneventful and apparently fastbr br So now we have Campbell Jr presenting himself over the air as the Last Free American The scheme for transmitting secret messages is fairly realistic and exciting  although one wonders what happened when Campbell Jr really and honestly had to cough hiccup etc must have scrambled the messages terribly Anyway the Nazis lose the wife dies touring in the Crimean for German troops  I never heard such tours really happened on German front lines in WW II Campbell Jr says he goes to the Russian front but does not go is captured by an American soldier who recognizes his mug how come is dragged to a sightseeing tour in Auschwitz is then released and resettled with the help of the Crucial Agent somewhere in the City of New Yorkbr br AND THIS IS WHERE THE STORY REALLY STARTS br br BANG From now on it is like a short story by Paul Auster It is 1961 Campbell Jr lives in New York tenement as a hasbeen and mourns the loss of his wife Nobody really cares  or do they Yes somehow they do and his neighbors offer some sort of distraction Auschwitz survivors A painter Some American supremacists discover him and want him to be their figurehead They even find his presumed dead wife for him or is she his wife Anyway in the end Campbell Jr calls in at the Israeli consulate and they obligingly give him the Big War Criminal treatment placing him in the cell adjacent to Adolf Eichmanns He writes his life story and once this task finished hangs himself on the typewriters ribbons without getting sooty the least bitbr br While I can see that there must be an issue of guilt and of loss I just had the impression that the main character is a person who at all times is pretty indifferent to everything and hardly capable of love for anyone So I found it difficult to sympathize for this looser who mourns his loss Amazingly many reviewers focus on his status as a potential war hero having put his reputation at stake for playing the Last Free American I assume according to them this took a lot of courage As a matter of fact however the movie suggests that by accepting the assignment Campbell created for himself a winwin situation as he would have been politically on the safe side no matter who had won the war The danger of his being uncovered never comes up during the first part of the storybr br One might argue that the whole story is a dreamlike fantasy and that nobody should bother with historical accuracy or a logical development of the story which explains everything But even then it fails to make a point primarily I suspect because the love affair in the Republic of Two falls completely flat This is a pity especially if you consider that the wife was played by Sheryl Lee a talented versatile and sensuous actress She has much too little screen time and is forced to use a ridiculous German accent Another somehow neglected aspect are the different texts confession broadcast and hidden messages but I guess this is largely unfilmable Maybe I should give the book a chance,negative
Sadly I dont remember the book anymore but I do recall that I was captivated by the stories of Edgar Wallace This Film represents a typical German Production of low quality It does not hold my attention  although the story itself is good it is just badly adabted At the center of the misery are the characters that are overly simplyfied and exaggerated  they have no nuances in their performances Even the well known and liked German Actors Joachim Fuchsberger and Eddy Arent cannot rescue this poor spectacle However theres hope  Ive been told that the films following this one are getting better and better So in conclusion I must say that this film doesnt deserve the cinematic screen but may be enough for a lazy afternoon,negative
Cant say this wasnt made well At a recent film festival the director admitted some scenes took 30 takes And there isnt the slightest indication he didnt get exactly what he wanted But this is an oddly nonHispanic film in the same way West Side Story was many years ago Both the leads a brothersister team are excellent and memorable in their parts The setting a sort of underground car repair district in Queens is completely foreign to most people and is worth the price of admission by itself But theres something unsatisfying about the key issue in the film namely what the sister feels she has to do to get by I can understand the brothers reaction but it just seems a little too easily come by to me The movie seems to suggest that people like these dont need our help that theyll find a way to survive without the usual support systems I wouldnt encourage anyone to believe that There would be far more resistance to the choices made here than depicted Other than that as an entertainment it works well As an accurate depiction of a culture not so well I think,positive
Chuck Joness Odorable Kitty is the cartoon that introduced Pepe Le Pew to the world sort of There are a few key differences between the Pepe we know and love or hate in the case of some people and the character in this cartoon For one the disguised cat who Pepe amorously pursues in Odorable Kitty is distinctly male Also Pepe is exposed as a fraud whose real name is Henry at the cartoons climax his French accent dropping away when his wife and family turn up Pepe is not even the lead character here the focus favouring the putupon cat who disguises himself as a skunk to scare off his enemies For the most part the storyline largely follows the usual format of a Pepe Le Pew cartoon but Pepes aggressive courtship is lacking the usual wisecracks and straight to camera addresses that make him such a great character He is also not nearly as handsome as he would become and rather awkwardly animated In fact Odorable Kitty is a fairly ugly and clumsy looking cartoon all round Its main source of appeal comes from its concept which was original at this stage before it became the template for every Pepe Le Pew cartoon that followed This subsequent development has robbed Odorable Kitty of any impact whatsoever and to modern viewers it just looks like a rather dull Pepe Le Pew short with a weird surprise ending As a child I hated Pepe Le Pew As an adult able to appreciate his more sophisticated verbal and risqué humour I love the character and most of his cartoons Odorable Kitty makes me feel like a child again,negative
Where do I begin its one of the most frustrating movies Ive seen because it makes a lot of sense in terms of the point but it comes off as seriously stupid A movie about a ghost inhabited bed The first 2 minutes of the movie shows a black and white flashback of a weird looking fat dude going dominatrix on a Fabienne from Pulp Fiction lookalike contest winner and strangles her with his tie This is supposed to set up how the bed factors into the story Still though if you wanted an opening to keep people interested or send them away early having a strangulation is the way to do it Fast forward to the present day a married couple moves into an apartment with a friendly landlord and begins unpacking their things so far everythings normal Then one night while doing the hippity dippity on a single mattress they realize they need a bed frame This is where things get fishy why didnt they bring or buy a gd damn bed frame before they got there We learn that the door leading to the attic where the first 2 minutes took place doesnt open but then once the couple realizes they need a bed frame the door magically opens They go up to the attic and discover the old bed frame and decide to bring it downstairs and their lovemaking days are savedor so they thought The rest of the movie centers around the both of them being haunted by the bedframe The female is an artist so she starts drawing up the ghoulish images she dreams about and the male is a photographer so he starts having his models act as if theyre bring tortured or tied upone of which has gray hair and appears over 50 years old yuck The female grows increasingly scared and she discovers the house she lives in was once a haven for serial killings and murders which bring about the end to the movie They find the friendly landlord murdered which makes no sense since ghosts need to take a human form to kill and decide to get the hell out of dodge While packing up the husband moronically goes up into the attic where he is possessed by the crazy fat dude and the female bashes his skull in before the cops show up and take her to a mental ward where she kills some dude trying to hit on herbr br Well if youve read this far you have to be thinking one thingWHY THE HELL DIDNT THEY JUST THROW THE BEDFRAME OUT THE WINDOW Seriously they never said anything about the actual house being haunted just the bedso why not get rid of the damn thing and move on Thats why the movie is so frustrating because it actually is a good plot and the actors follow suit accordingly but there are more holes in it than Sonny Corleone at a toll booth The couple did try to leave town as upposed to every other movie that has the ol oh lets give this place a chance honey scheme going so props to that Still though me and my buddy who watched the movie kept saying every 5 minuteswhy didnt they just throw the bed out Especially once they learned it was haunted would have been a good time to set it on fire or somethingbr br All in all its a nearwatchable movie with plenty of porno like bed scenes and a believable plot to an extent but the solution is so simple youre scratching your head by the end of the movie wondering how stupid can the married couple be The highlight of the movie is when the husband tells the 50 year old model to spread her legs and his assistant tells him that he cant shoot her like thatbr br 4 out of 10 a low budget porno The Man Show would love,negative
This gripping tale of intergenerational love jealousy and revenge was even more enjoyable to see on DVD years after its PBS broadcast with a sharper picture and crisper sound My only reservations are that the plot has a few improbable moments and that some of the stronger Manchester accents are difficult at times Luckily even missing a word here and there wont spoil the fun the primary actors are ideally cast Robson Green brings an enigmatic smile a goforbroke temperament and an athletic physicality to his role as a young surgeon who falls hopelessly for the wife of his boss at the hospital where hes just begun to work Francesca Annis is one of the most striking 50ish women imaginable her acting rivals her beauty The love scenes between these two demonstrate better than words how little the age difference matters to them Each of the supporting characters is sharply drawn and excellently portrayed as well The mix of pithy dialog and passionate excess makes this a delightful miniseries As Russell Baker notes in his introduction you may not be morally improved by viewing Reckless  but youll have plenty of fun The sequel a part of the DVD box set provides a wild yet satisfying twohour denouement You wont want to miss it if youve enjoyed what came before,positive
Can I give this a minus rating No Well let me say that this is the most atrocious film I have ever tried to watch It was Painful Boringus Maximus The plot is well hidden in several sublevels of nebulosity I rented this film with a friend and after about thirty minutes of hoping it would get better we decided to fast forward a little to see if things would get any better It never gets better This film about some dude getting kidnapped by these two girls sounds interesting but in reality it is just a bore Nothing even remotely interesting ever happens If you ever get the chance to watch this do yourself a favor try PLAN NINE FROM OUTER SPACE instead,negative

Breaking Glass is a film that everyone aspiring to be in the music industry should see more than once It is a very dark tale about the way a record company manipulates a singer to do things their way and to make as much money out of her as possible Looking at some of todays search for a star style TV shows on both in the UK and abroad I am always reminded of this film Though not an expert on the subject the winners of these shows tend to have one very big initial hit and then its downhill from there This film predates these shows though the effect seems the same After getting rid of her manager played quite brilliantly by Phil Daniels slowly but surely the record company changes her lyrics puts her on stimulants and she is eventually totally burnt out You potential stars of tomorrow WATCH THIS AND BEWARE ,positive
I was required to watch the movie for my work so I didnt pay for it on the contrary i got paid but I still found the movie to suck far more than average The jokes were lame the two lead actresses well to use the First wives club division of womens ages in Hollywood they are no longer in their hot chick age but more in their district attorney age What angered me most about the movie was the main plot line which pretty much completely plagiarized Beavis  Butthead Do America in which the boys are all jazzed up about some dude offering them money to do his wife not realizing theyre expected to assassinate her All in all a bland piece of crap,negative

If you are looking for a cinematic masterpiece this aint it If you are looking for one of those awful movies that are so horrible that they are actually good then this may be for you There are so many unintentional laughs in this film that it could almost be considered a comedy Lets start with the opening titles that say JackO and then add the word Lantern as if the viewer wasnt able to figure out the movie was about a pumpkin by the giant pumpkin shown on both the cover and in the opening scene of the movie After that the movie goes in about 20 different directions none of which make much sense Jacko is everywhere hes in peoples houses in the woods and yet he doesnt ever seem to do much of anything He does make a few kills but the long buildup to those killings is so poorly acted and constructed you almost wish Jacko would take out his rage on you the viewer Other than that the plot consists of poor acting gratuitous nudity and a ridiculous plot line The acting in this film is among the worst Ive ever seen in my 35 plus years of moviewatching The boy who is the lead in the film the directors son has about as much emotion as a corpse and just about all of the other actorsactresses are just as bad for numerous reasons especially the bugeyed lady with eyes bigger than saucers But having said all this if you take this for what it is that is a steaming pile of dung then you will get a few laughs from this movie What I also found amusing is that the makers of the DVD saw fit to release a 10th Anniversary Version of this movie as if the original wasnt good enough And someone actually had the idea of making a behind the scenes mini film which is also included in the 10th anniversary edition Im not sure whyIll give this 3 smashed pumpkins out of 10,negative

This brief review contains no spoilers since the movie spoils itself It is wooden and pedantic It has no saving grace whatsoever If someone invites you to his house to watch Mr Imperium dont go Even the title of the movie is dreadful and portends what garbage lies within The whole plot is so bad that it could drive Mother Theresa to despair It wasnt a stroke that led to the early demise of poor Ezio it was having to act in this clunker that did him in It must have haunted him the rest of his days Perhaps he was an enemy alien and wanted revenge upon the Americans for his confinement He found a perfect vehicle for his wrath in this travesty,negative

This was alright It was one of those We Gotcha But We Dont Have Enough Evidence Yet storylines In the couple handfulls of movies Ive seen her in Ive never really though much of Stephanie Zimbalist A professional TV actress she is but nothing really outstanding Here in this she was definitely above average as the former fed or was it fed on loan profiler Her character got along well with the motley bunch of Special Investigation Unit cops she was assigned with There wasnt really a goofy character youd roll your eyes at and just despise which was good Also good is it takes awhile to know who the murderer is but when I found out I wasnt that surprised Oh well One more thing that was good was the Los Angeles locations Quite possibly if this was made today theyd use Toronto or Vancouver but here they really shot in downtown LA Like that a lot even though I semidespise LA Liked the movie too I dont know if Id ever watch it again but it wasnt too bad My grade B,positive
The Snow Queen is based on the famous and very beautiful fairytale by Hans Christian Andersen about a girl Gerda who goes on a dangerous journey to rescue her friend Kai from the clutches of the Snow Queen This adaption attempts to capture that storys sense of adventure and luminously intricate imagery through lavish sets and production design but fails on a number of countsbr br Like so many Hallmark productions the potential of the story is completely undercut by heavyhanded scripting and direction The two actors playing Gerda and Kai are blandly pleasant but forgettable Bridget Fonda as the Snow Queen looks the part but is otherwise miscast for the role Theres a notable lack of dramatic tension to this meandering threehour miniseries At least some of the pacing problems can be attributed to the addition of filler scenes that add very little to the original story particularly in the opening hour that introduces the main charactersbr br That said The Snow Queen would be just about ideal for preteens with a liking for fantasy and a bit of patience Its great eyecandy without being scary and the acting is pitched at the sort of pantomime overthetop level that spells out the storyline in very very bold text Just make sure you read them Andersens story too,negative
SPOILERSbr br This movie was truly awful This woman deceives her employers right from the start and then selfishly proceeds to tear them apart At the end you see her making a profession out of the trade shed learned from the father of her pupil I put pupil in quotes because the governess never really seems to teach the child anything She seems to hate her and cant stand being near her I felt sorry for the little girl who simply wanted to be loved absent that it was understandable that she would say and do outrages things just to get attention but the viewer wasnt supposed to sympathize with the little girl the viewer was supposed to sympathize with the governess who hated her pupil and manipulated and deceived her employers I just couldnt do it This was not the story of a self made woman rather it was a window into the mind of one who uses others at every opportunity with no other thought for anyone outside of her own family I couldnt stand the governess This was a really horrible movie I only paid one dollar to rent it but even that was too much,negative
I enjoyed a lot watching this movie It has a great direction by the already know Bigas Luna born in Spain And it is precisely in Spain that the movie takes place in Cataluña to be more precisebr br Luna explores once more the theme of an obcession in this case the obcession of a young boy for the womens milk There are some psychological concepts in this story such as the rejection complex that the elder son feels with the birth of his brother In the movie this is what leads to the obcession of the young boy who suddenly sees all his mothers milk go to the recently born son So he starts trying to find a breast who is able to feed him He finds it in a woman recently arrived and from here on the movie is all around thisbr br This movie lives a lot on imagery more than the story itself the espectator captures certain moments unforgettable moments and certain symbols the movie deserves a thourough analyses on almost everything that happens because it usually means something The surroundings the landscapes typical from the region as well as the surreal behaviors of the characters also symbolic and the excelent ambiguous soundtrack by Nicola Piovani transport us to another dimension not parallel to the real world but which intersects it from times to times Worth living in that world worth watching this movie even though we may eventually and for moments get tired and a bit sick with the excessive obcession which is perhaps taken beyond the limitsbr br I also enjoyed the performance of the protagonist 810,positive
I am very impressed with the acting in Comanche Moon Before I started watching this I wasnt expecting it to be as good as Lonesome Dove I couldnt believe how well the actors were chosen to represent all the characters It blew my mind how well they played each role This was in my opinion almost as good as Lonesome Dove Its hard to compare any film to Lonesome Dove If you dont make that comparison I would give this a thumbs up It was very entertaining I dont post many comments on this site but I just felt I had to get my opinion out there Amazing I dont want to go off naming every actor who was brilliant because I would probably have to list every single one My favorite was Steve Zahn He hit the nail on the head playing Captain Gus His mannerisms were perfect,positive
Uncle Frank is everyones uncle This documentary covered all aspects of aging in America the lonliness the humor the irony Uncle Frank and Aunt Tillie were supremely generous in sharing their life experiences with the audience The director did an unbelieveable job of capturing the small and large pieces that made up their lives Thanks to everyone who helped in making this film,positive
The 1983 BBC production of Jane Eyre starring Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton LOVE HIM has always been and will always be my favorite Jane Eyre If you watch any other version of Jane Eyre without reading the book it will be like watching some regular movie which you will forget the next day But watching this one almost equals to reading the book I used to watch these miniseries a lot when I was little and they inspired me to read the book At the time I didnt pay attention to how close this television production was to the book Recently I watched the 1996 version of Jane Eyre and was very disappointed It was only 2 hours long and didnt have many important scenes from the book such as my favorite gypsy scene After that I fell in love with This Jane Eyre even more because it includes all the important scenes of the book and it just tells the whole story the other versions dont if you havent read the book br br The cast of 1983 Jane Eyre is excellent Its true that Timothy Dalton is a very handsome actor handsome enough to play Butler in Scarlet and Julius Caesar but he is so great as Rochester that I cant imagine anybody else playing this role And Zelah Clarke is without a doubt the only Jane that follows the description of the book The other thing that makes this film so great is the clothes and the makeup of the actors Jane looks so modest and naive just as Bronte describes her although she doesnt look 18 but do you actually pay attention to that br br Some people say that this Jane Eyre is too long but I would rather spend my whole day watching it than spend 2 hours watching some other version Some say the movie is dull and boring because Jane is not passionate enough or because there are not enough kissing scenes I hate when they make Jane Eyre some Hollywood movie with inappropriate kissing scenes You dont have to include crazy madly in love scenes to show the love between Jane and Rochester And both Zelah and Timothy express this love so perfectly that there are no other scenes needed I am 19 years old and many girls of my age refer to this film as boring and oldfashioned But I can only feel sorry for them because they dont appreciate the purity and beauty of it After all the novel is set in 19th century and that oldfashioned look makes it more attractive and more like the book br br I dont think there will ever be any other version of Jane Ayre that will have the popularity and love of this one No matter who plays Jane and Rochester in other movies the real Jane and Rochester for me at least will always be Zelah Clarke and Timothy Dalton,positive
One of the best TV shows out there if not the best one Why Simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichés and predictable twists This is not Prison Break or any other show actually comparing to Oz the show Sopranos look like story for childrens Profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in Oz But this is not the best part of Oz the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals The actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing Ryan OReilly and Tobias Beecher because theyre so unique and changing their behavior completely And most of all the dont have no remorse for their actions Overall Oz is amazing show the best one out there Forget about CSI and shows about stupid doctors this is the deal OZ,positive
This movie is like so many biopic TV movies I have seen formulaic exaggerating poorly acted and most importantly happening too soonbr br What I mean by that is the movie was filmed and for that matter aired before Michael Jacksons acquittal from his child molestation charges which I think was one of the most significant periods of Jacksons life and career so far It probably would have made a great ending to this docudrama However this movie already bites off more than it can chew cramming too many details in this overly ambitious projectbr br Its no doubt that Michael Jackson has led perhaps the most interesting life so far of any musician let alone modern day pop star to date and his story would probably take six Behind The Music specials to tell accurately This movie tried to tell too much in three hours and needless to say it failedbr br Flex Alexander did what he could in playing Jackson but he came off more like an SNL caricature by the likes of Tim Meadows and Amy Poehler It would admittedly be pretty hard to find someone who accurately portrays Jackson without meeting with the King of Pop himself and studying his methods of madness On a shoestring budget though one can only depend on what they see in the tabloids and those do not necessarily give an accurate representationbr br Furthermore the directors efforts to make Alexander look like Jackson are completely foolish The Caucasian makeup on Alexanders face makes him look more like a reverse minstrel show and everyone who has been in a grocery store knows that Jacksons nose is not as big as Alexanders Its also amazing to me that the film documents Jackson going under the knife to get cosmetic surgery yet in the next scene Alexander still has the same size nose This kind of suspension of disbelief that the director expects cant hold up to TV viewers in the 21st centurybr br It was even more distracting when footage of the real Michael Jackson ie the time he hung his infant child over a balcony in Germany was interspersed into the movie in real time It was a nice try but it just didnt workbr br If this movie as it is was released into theaters it would gain a profit only because of its tackiness It even pales in comparison to Mommie Dearest and thats saying a lot Above all this was a movie that was probably rushed into making like many TV movies that arent on HBO It could have been done a lot better if it had just told of one aspect of Jacksons life Even if it just covered the child molestation allegations it probably would have been done a lot better and would have even been more intriguing,negative
Stephen Seagal plays the role of a dude who gets talked into driving an armored car for a bank hold up and drives into everything that comes across his path However the police seem to appear on the scene very quickly and Seagal smells a rat who gave the police advanced notice The story gets into many twists and turns and the money from the hold up has disappeared and nobody knows its new owner Poor Seagal gets a bit framed into this hold up and naturally he is out looking for the person or persons who are trying to put him away for a long time In this film Seagal tries to be a good guy but the forces of evil are against him Unfortunately this is not a great film and rather boring and too long,negative

This review is based on the Producers Cut br br Halloween 5 was a major disappointment at the box office way back in 89 Personally Ive always loved it and am proud to have it in my collection But because of its failure and also because of rights issues it would be 6 years before we would see another installment The film had the makings of being one of the best if not the best in the series A hardcore fan writing the script the return of not only Donald Pleasence as Dr Loomis and George Wilbur as Michael Myers but also the return of the character of Tommy Doyle from the first film a major studio backing the project and a Fall release all made the film sound like a hit in the making So what went wrong Ill give you two good reasons Reshoots and poor editing Due to a bad test screening and also the unfortunate passing of Donald Pleasence the film was changed and not for the better The film like parts III and 5 tanked at the box office and earned negative reviews from both critics and most series fans But then thanks to the magic of bootlegging the original cut leaked out and many fans including my self were very happy I will end this portion of my review by saying this This film is so far at least my favorite Halloween film and Im not afraid to admit thatbr br Pros The score is simply spellbinding Has some of the best writing and dialogue of the series Halloween 4 emulated the original in that it was more about suspense and mood instead of blood and guts and 6 is the same way Great performances especially from the late and very missed Donald Pleasence Moves at a breathtaking pace An interesting explanation for Michaels evil and why he wont die Some brutal kills Some pretty chilling moments my favorite being the one involving Kim Darbys character A lot of really cool nods to the previous films Some good surprises Like the previous two sequels this one has an awesome cliffhanger endingbr br Cons Though the explanation for Michaels evil is fascinating it does make him a little less scary Since when can Michael move around from place to place so fast br br Final thoughts This was the first Halloween that I saw in the theatre I was so excited because I really had thought 5 would be the last and then I heard this was happening I enjoyed it at the time but over time I saw it for what it really was A great movie trapped in an OK one with a terrible ending Why did the filmmakers have to listen to the people at the test screenings If they had released this superior version it may have done much better and the series might not be stuck in the mess its in right nowbr br My rating 55,positive

I saw this film premiere Friday 119 night in Park City for Sundance and was incredibly moved Sitting in a theater and hearing firsthand the anguish soldiers go through was almost more than I could bear Others in the audience were equally moved and while we wanted to turn away the least we could do was bear witness as these men and women shared their experience with us Robert Acosta Paul Rieckhoff Sean Huze and Herold Noel all veterans of the war in Iraq and featured in the film were present While they may be home now you can tell this war is still inside them and probably always will be Whether you support the war or not it is OUR duty to support the troops with something other than a bumper sticker See this film,positive
Bogdonovichs mostly unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other A film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic Manhattan locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in NYC Ive ever seen John Ritter reminds us that with good directors Bogdanovich Blake Edwards Billy Bob he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group youll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesnt seem to be a ripoff of something else this is the high point of Bogdanovichs fertile after success career when his best work was truly done saint jack at long last noises off,positive
This is a very funny movie There is a self deprecating iconoclastic tone to the movie that is very appealing The characters are interesting The movie flows very well and holds your interest throughout the 1 hour 50 minutes duration of the film The film quality is not of the highest Hollywood standards however the original film was supposed to be made in the genre of a gritty punkrock style The documentary about the attempt to make the film and the subsequent betrayal of the film makers is very well detailed and easy to follow The original film makers themselves become the main characters in the documentary version of the movie The interviews of the film makers and the actors has been assembled in a highly entertaining story that illustrates the struggles involved in making the original film the eventual failure of the original project and the phoenixlike rising from the ashes that evolved into this documentary film In my mind the documentary A Texas Tale of Treason is a much more interesting and entertaining film than the original film Waldos Hawiian Vacation would have ever been Two thumbs up for a job well done,positive
Yes this IS a horror anthology film and it was a lot of fun Thats because although the film clearly was horror some of the stories had a light spiritand there were even occasionally a few laughs This isnt at all a bad thing as sometimes horror films are a bit stuffy and overly serious Because of this and because all four of the stories were pretty good its one of the better movies of this style I have seenbr br The unifying theme that connects each story is the house itself Four different stories involve people who either rent the home or investigate what happened to the tenantsbr br The first segment starred Denholm Elliott as a horror writer who has writers block So for a change of scenery they rent this house Almost immediately Elliotts block vanishes and he works steadily on a tale about a serial killer Amazingly soon after his block vanishes he begins to actually see his fictional character Again and again the psychotic killer appears and then disappearsmaking it seem as if he is losing his mind This might just be the best of the stories as the nice twist ending makes the story come alivebr br The second while not bad at all is probably the weakest Peter Cushing plays a bachelor who is pining for a girl friend who died some time ago though the picture of her looked amazingly contemporary When he enters a chamber of horrors wax museum in town he sees a wax figure that reminds him of his lost lady and he is both fascinated and scared by this Later a friend Joss Ackland visits and he too sees the figure and is entranced by it This all leads to an ending that frankly was a bit of a letdownbr br Christopher Lee then stars as an incredibly harsh and stern father to a pathetic little girl During most of this segment Lee seemed like an idiot but in the end you can understand his demeanor Though slow this one ended very wellbr br The fourth segment was the silliest and was meant to parody the genre Jon Pertwee the third Doctor from the DR WHO television series is a very temperamental actor known for his portrayals of Dracula However nothing is right about the film according to him and in a fit of pique he stomps off the set to find better props for this vampire film Its actually pretty interesting that he played this role as it seemed like a natural for Christopher Lee who played Dracula or other vampires a bazillion times give or take a few I enjoyed Pertwees line when he basically said that Lees and other recent incarnations of Dracula were all crap compared to Bela Lugosis Perhaps this is why Lee didnt take this part Despite some very silly moments it was very entertaining and funpossibly as good or better than the first segmentbr br Considering that the film started and ended so well had excellent acting and writing its hard not to like this film,positive
This movie really left me thinking  but not about the plot the direction the characters an underlying message or a clever script Far from it I was left wondering what in Sam Hill went wrong behind the scenes Clearly something was badly amiss from the beginningbr br Im amazed at the positive comments for the movie and for Jodie Fosters performance From the getgo it was clear that Foster had phoned this one in One earlier comment even made a favorable mention of her facial expressions I must have been watching a different movie since Ms Foster usually a personal favorite seemed to be totally disinterestedbr br In one of his first scenes with Foster Fred Ward looks as though he also is distracted by her lack of energy and he struggles to deliver his own lines with any enthusiasm By the time hes called upon to take part in a supposedly desperate search for runaway Foster Ward also seems to have become embarrassingly halfhearted about the projectbr br In my opinion Dennis Hopper has always been a unidimensional performer so I wasnt expecting much from him  and he deliveredbr br Yes this one left me thinking long after it ended The fact that Joe Pesci and Charlie Sheen refused to have their names attached to the project suggests that this was a real stinker for everyone involved But to then learn that the Director preferred to hide behind a pseudonym speaks volumesbr br But why listen to me I always think Foster looks ridiculous in a dress yet shes sensational in lacy underwear,negative
Please spare me of these movies that teach us that crime is fun and justified Couple that with a vacuous script with an intense desire to be a Farrelly or a Coen brother plus the lives of yet ANOTHER group of supposedly high school age people acting out their Dawson Creekbrand teen angst complete with a GenXYZ soundtrack that woefully tries to make the movie feel cool and we have intensely and painfully inept satirebr br This isnt even watereddown Ferris BuellerId rather watch a traffic light changebr br Only one scene stands out as anywhere near worth the price of admission when the Betty Masked girls meet a Richard Nixon Masked friend Its a surreal moment Priceless evenbr br But for the rest of it Id rather have a toothache At least I can apply some Benzocainetm to stop the pain,negative
Following a sitcom plot is so mindlessly easy that having her character simultaneously operate both within and without the context the rest of the cast inhabit is the kind of experimentalism that sitcoms could really use The supporting characters ground the show in a sitcom reality which provides a contextual counterpoint to Sarahs erratic persona which beyond general insensitivity has no specific recurring traits for behavioural expectations to be based on making her less a character than a canvas to be repainted in every episode if not scene Sarahs ability to see everything from an outside perspective enables her to parody aspects of social behaviour that are subtle enough to usually go unnoticed Every time she speaks its like a selfcontained 5 second skit She overemotes a lot demonstrating the countless things a smile or change in vocal pitch can signify but never sticks with one idea long enough for you to get comfortable and form expectations that will be satisfied This may be the most creative original and experimental TV program ever,positive

When you first sit down to watch this movie keep in mind that you are about to see something youve probably never seen before Keep in mind that this is a movie where they obviously spent INSANE amounts of cash on explosions and not enough on acting or anything else for that matter The crazy thing I noticed is that every character is completely overportrayed and it seems most of the time anyhow that the film had been spedup to make the characters move faster I wonder if the Hong Kong version was dubbed too I understand the cartoon had this but it doesnt work for liveaction It just looks odd as if the camera crew decided to act because they couldnt afford real actorsbr br The English version is horribly dubbed and the characters words do not match the mouths at all I would have preffered subtitles but since this is a kids movie and since some kids cannot read well Ill let it go But there is something extremely odd about this movie Its supposedly a kids movie but theres a lot of material about SEX RAPE and STRIPPING which isnt exactly for young Western audiences In the Orient they have different laws and sexuality in childrens movies is much more accepted But parents be warned There is a scene where two characters talk about rape multiple scenes where people say sex maniac and a scene where this insanely young japanese girl does a sexy dance for one of the sex maniacs and shows him her breasts Who was this movie made for anywaybr br Oh and the special effects are laughable You can tell the spaceshiplike things that bomb the village are cardboard cutouts or animation I wasnt sure that look unconvincing even to a kid The makers of this movie left out a lot of cool things from the cartoon simply because they couldnt budget the kind of money theyd need I didnt like how the names of all the characters were changed it made me wonder if this movie was made by the same people as Dragon Ball Zbr br I dont really recommed this movie to anyone Kids adults or Dragon Ball Z fans Its just a poor representation of the cartoon and obviously one will be able to tell that this movie was rushed and no care whatsoever was put into it I wont even get into the camerawork just wait until the end credits at the still picture that sits there for 2 minutes most of the shots are not framed correctly AT ALL and the movie just seems made by amateurs Grainy film quality toobr br Just all around horriblebr br ,negative
The Menagerie parts one and two was the only 2parter during the 3year run of the original Trek series and it was because Roddenberry was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot The Cage The move was made out of necessity to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time One positive outcome back then was that audiences unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters as if the producers had spent double the money on these episodes to present a TV epic spanning a dozen years of Starfleet history though they still used terms such as United Space Fleet in these early episodesbr br The wraparound story begins as a space mystery plot the Enterprise is diverted to Starbase 11 for unknown reasons and very soon Spock is a suspect in these shenanigans Astonishingly though even McCoy belabors the fact that Spocks Vulcan heritage makes subterfuge on his part impossible it does turn out that Spock is indeed acting out some mutinous scheme to shanghai our precious starship and kidnap his former captain Pike now horribly crippled Well Spock is half human we tend to forget Or has he simply gone mad It may very well be for hes directing Enterprise to Talos IV a planet so offlimits its the subject of the only known death penalty on Starfleets books When the jig is up theres a great scene of Spock surrendering to a flabbergasted McCoy as Uhura looks on in shock Even Kirk usually steady as a captain should be doesnt know what to make of his first officers illogical conductbr br In the 3rd and final acts we begin to see transmitted images of a mission of the Enterprise from 13 years prior when Capt Pike was commanding and Spock was one of his officers We really dont know where all this is going and what Spock hopes to accomplish  and thats another thing that makes this a very good 2parter  we really need to find out what its all about in the 2nd part Not only is Spock facing severe penalties but it looks like Kirks career may be finished as well Double jeopardy folks This is also the 1st televised episode to feature one of those shuttlecrafts none were available in the earlier The Enemy Within when the crafts were really needed Theres also one of those neat matte paintings to convey the ambiance of a futuristic starbase  this was the only way to visualize such things back then Finally check out Kirks smug approach at the start of the episode  boy do things go sideways on him as the story progresses,positive

I do not think I am alone when I say that 2005 has not been particularly kind to the horror genre While Cursed Hide and Seek The Ring Two and The Amityville Horror all showed glimpses of interest and potential there have been more misses than hits For proof see White Noise Boogeyman The Jacket Mindhunters and Alone in the Dark Imagine my surprise when House of Wax tightly written by siblings Chad and Carey Hayes turned out to be well a surprisebr br Carly Jones Elisha Cuthbert is a young woman traveling with her troublemaking brother Nick Chad Michael Murray and boyfriend Wade Jared Padalecki They are along with Paige Paris Hilton Blake Robert Richard and Dalton Jon Abrahams hoping to score tickets to the final football game of the season Along the way they run into some car trouble and are forced to enter a desolate town where nothing is what it appears to bebr br Upon hearing of this a remake of the classic Vincent Price Bmovie I rolled my eyes I did not even want to think about what disaster freshman director Jaume Serra had cooked up for his audience In a time when most highprofile horror films are disappointments latent with bad writing static direction and amateur acting I consider myself lucky that Serra and the Hayes brothers took it upon themselves to make a good oldfashioned spook fest Unlike the disappointments that I named before this flick pulls no punches and uses every cinematic trick in the book to give everyone exactly what they came forbr br I am happy that the Hayes actually took the time and effort to create likable and believable characters thus making the events that much more urgent It also gives the young actors portraying them something grip on As she did in The Girl Next Door Elisha Cuthbert proves to audiences what a skilled actress she really is In the 2003 remake of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre Jessica Biel silenced naysayers by delivering a raw and emotional performance one that put the viewer right there with her Here Cuthbert does the same Chad Michael Murray A Cinderella Story in one of his first more mature roles is no slacker as Nick Murray exudes charisma and a hard edge as well as some impressive athleticism on top of it Murray and Cuthbert gel perfectly and have tangible familial chemistrybr br More so than anything else the press and the American public have made a field day about Paris Hiltons major acting debut As I expected Hilton does not embarrass herself In fact she is just as good as anyone else in the movie do with that what you will Like Cuthbert and Murray Hilton has screen presence She is sexy and playful I cannot think one of reason why shes gotten the worst of the films harsh reception other than they are simply picking on her Jared Padalecki TVs Gilmore Girls memorably manages to overcome his underwritten role Robert Richard TVs Cousin Skeeter and Jon Abrahams Meet the Parents do not have much to work with but get the job done With only one scene Damon Herriman Soar makes an unforgettable impression and his presence hangs over the rest of the film Finally Brian Van Holt Basic is superb and threatening in a dual rolebr br Once more kudos must go to the screenwriters for avoiding clichés whenever possible Despite popular opinion House of Wax is quite unpredictable for a majority of its running time Take this for example It seems as if the killer is down for the count and Carly bends down to retrieve something from his pockets What do you expect to happen See the movie and you will understand what I mean It is also refreshing to see a horror film in which the characters show even a modicum of good sensebr br Unlike most horror scores John Ottmans exhilarating work never distracts However as with Dark Castles other releases the visual aspects of Wax are awardworthy and lift the film above its genre trappings The talents of cinematographer Stephen F Windon production designer Graham Walker art director Nicholas McCallum and editor Joel Negron highlight the ghoulish imagery Speaking of imagery I believe that the gore hounds will be thrilled with the many makeup effects and tricks in store here Each death scene is more stomach churning than the last Considering his past in music videos and commercials it is obvious that Jaume Serra has a great eye for style His inyourface approach is a great asset to this films success Just when you think the camera will turn away it does not He is also particularly good a building thick layers of dread and atmosphere One standout shot is our introduction to the killer as he slowly emerges from a trap doorbr br In a case like this I would usually admit when I am in the minority Shut up okay I liked House of 1000 Corpses In this case I firmly that the detractors have gotten it wrong I am not sure why people are so hard on this film considering its much better than recent genre entries Maybe theyre afraid to admit that a horror flick starring Paris Hilton could possibly be worth watching Who knows This is a horror film and a commendably stylish and effective one at that As a lifelong horror fan all I can say is that I thoroughly enjoyed House of Wax in all of its lurid and sadistic

What can I say about THE PLEASURE PLANET that I havent said about umpteen other tedious soft core porn films  Very little  Its just another movie with a very weak plot used to set up very unconvincing set scenes between male non actors who spend too much time in the gym and bimbos who have obviously had silicon implants  Actually the sex scenes in this movie are somewhat less convincing than you usually see in this type of film as the cast members grind their hips together giving pained expressions like theyve got constipation or something  No wonder a lot of people claim sex is over rated  theyve probably watched too many of these films on late night cable stations,negative
Frantic somewhat mean spirited infantile humor abounds in this city boy turned wannabe farmer tale It is not outrageous enough to appeal to the Will Ferrell crowd and not interesting enough to carry the feature length The most I can praise Son In Law would be to say that for the most part it avoids toilet humor The main problem is that all of the characters lack warmth and Pauly Shore is so abrasive that he is a most unlikable hero There are a few amusing bits involving farm animals and thats about it The story what there is is so simplistic and predictable it makes Jury Duty seem like Gone with the Wind  MERK,negative
When I went to see this movie it was already a forced choice as my original intent was sold out what ensuited then was sheer terror this movie is so bad i could hardly bear it the story is not worth mention a gay goalkeeper forms a gay soccer team to play against his old straight team who  on discovering his sexual orientation  gave him a hard time loaded with unbearably old and overused clichés of gays the thin plot matches perfectly the inane dialogues it is absolutely astonishing that actors as dietmar bär or charly hübner waste their talent and time on such nonsense 110,negative
I dont know whether this film hits my heart the way it does because of the feelings of friendship love closeness to others or the warmth of that transformation Babettes cooking creates but when the feast starts and for the rest of the movie I choke up often br br Yes this is a feelgood movie but without a speck of mawkishness or facile sentimentality Please note that elements of the plot are discussed Babettes Feast tells its story with restraint and care and it lets us discover for ourselves the values of grace and love All we need to know is that Babette Harsant Stephane Audran was a French refugee who was given shelter by two aging sisters in a tiny community on the coast of Jutland The sisters lead what remains of their fathers flock He was a pastor of conviction who taught that salvation comes through selfdenial The sisters made their sacrifices to duty and faith Those who still remain honor the now long dead pastors teachings and his spiritual guidance Still as they have grown older the tiny community has become querulous and argumentative The sisters do what they can For the pastors 100th birthday Babette wishes to cook the dinner for the small group the sisters will invite The sisters reluctantly agree but when they see the supplies Babette has ordered they and their guests become uneasy They are used to the communitys usual fare of dried cod boiled and a soup made of bread water and a little ale Even though Babette over time has made improvements what they are seeing now seems close to godlessness At the dinner also will be a visitor General Lorens Lowenhielm who years earlier had chosen ambition over his love for one of the sisters br br What do we experience There is the austerity of the aging communitys faith and the stone windswept cottages they live in There is the warmth by candlelight of the sisters small crowded dining room And then there is the transforming power of Babettes artistry as we watch her cook watch Erik a young boy helping her serve and pour and watch the old parishioners with the help of fine wine and exquisite cooking gradually rediscover their community and love and friendship The General serves as our unexpected guide because he is the only one who knows what extraordinary dishes they are eating The General tells a story to his uncomprehending dinner companions a story about a famed woman who was the exemplary chef at the famed Café Anglais in Paris this woman this head chef had the ability to transform a dinner into a kind of love affaira love affair that made no distinction between bodily appetite and spiritual appetite He too is being transformed into a man who will accept what he has become and yet will always know the value and the love of what long ago he chose not to accept An old couple kiss Two old men remember past friendships And Babette who spent all that she had won in a lottery on this dinner has had an opportunity to be the artist she once was in France an opportunity she accepted with love and friendship br br Babette now as poor as she was when she arrived penniless years earlier will continue with the sisters The general in a carriage with his aunt returns to her estate And the elderly guests leave the sisters home to return to their own cottages They pause and look at the clear night sky and the stars overhead They spontaneously hold hands in a circle and dance and sing this hymn br br The clock strikes and time goes by Eternity is nigh Let us use this time to try To serve the Lord with heart and mind So that our true home we shall find So that our true home we shall find br br They smile at each other All has been reconciled br br Babettes Feast is a wonderful movie full of restrained emotion unspoken understandings wisdomand of course a meal that will leave you with a growling stomach as you exit the theater If you win a lottery so you could afford what Babette created and have her skill and artistry heres what she served br br Potage a la Tortue a rich turtle soup served with amontillado sherry Blinis Demidoff au Caviar small buckwheat pancakes with sour cream and caviar served with Veuve Clicquot champagne Cailles en Sarcophage with Sauce Perigourdine boned quail stuffed with foie gras and truffle in puff pastry with truffle sauce enriched with Madeira served with Clos de Vougeot a fine burgundy Salade Cheese and fresh fruit Baba au Rhum with glacee fruit and fresh figs Coffee and a fine brandy,positive
Arthur has always been a personal film for me for two reasons A good friend of mine who worked on the film as an extra and to help out with the horses during the stable scene just recently passed away If you look fast you can see Frank Graham during the restaurant scene in the background while Dudley Moore and Jill Eikenberry are in conversation Frank was a champion equestrian and will be missed by all who knew himbr br Secondly though I actually knew a real life Arthur Bach He was not quite as wealthy as Arthur but spent 47 years of his life basically as a kid His parents tightly controlled his purse strings but his rent and utilities were paid for in a basement apartment in Greenwich Village He spent a good deal of his time getting himself intoxicated on various spirits and making a public spectacle of himself just like Dudley Moore does br br The wonder with Arthur is why anyone would bother with him wealth of not But thats the other half of the equation My friend was a most charming person when you got to know him In fact it was almost a compulsion to be charming He couldnt buy a newspaper or magazine without trying to establish some level of relationship with the vendor He spent his life being a perfect party guest The term wastrel which was in common use in the 19th century would apply to himbr br And thats what Dudley Moore is a wastrel Unlike my friend Moore has John Gielgud to clean up after him Thats a full time job as we see demonstrated in Arthur My friend also never found a Liza Minnelli a male Liza Minnelli in fact because he was gay Still Moores portrayal of Arthur Bach is deadly accurate and so real for mebr br Arthur 20th century wastrel is being forced to marry another trust fund baby in Jill Eikenberry Since he wont work for a living the threat of being cut off is quite real for him He only has his butler Hobson played by John Gielgud and chauffeur Bitterman played by Ted Post to pour his troubles out to We should all have such troublesbr br John Gielgud in his nearly century of life certainly did better work than in Arthur on film and in fact Gielgud is more prominently known for his stage performances Yet 1981 was a year of sentiment at Oscar time The Academy gave Henry Fonda and Katharine Hepburn Oscars for On Golden Pond and Gielgud the Best Supporting Actor Award essentially for the work of a lifetime That man was amazing still at his craft almost to the endbr br So to Frank Graham who worked in the film and to Jackie Weiss a genuine real life Arthur I dedicate this review,positive

This film is about a grieving wife who lost her husband through suicide She is tormented by her son who refused to speak after thatbr br Child grief is rarely explored on film so it is refreshing to see a film like Addisons Wall However due to the very nature of the film there is no tension or drama Apart from a few key emotional moments everything in the film is very plain The abrupt ending that does not solve any mysteries certainly do not help the film to be more watchable Addisons Wall could have been much better such as exploration of the contents of the wall a more intensive care program to help Addison to go through his trauma Instead the film feels very unfinished and non engaging,negative

Im all for a bad horror movie but this was just a pile of dog sht How anyone can call this movie cool or decent is beyond me If you like rushed editing to cover the special effects bad acting and a bad script then go for it There was no suspense whatsoever and the gore factor was laughable because it was so fake Ill take Hostel or Wolf Creek over this pile any day My partner gave up after about 20 minutes she knows a stinker when she sees one I on the other hand stupidly sat through the whole movie just to wait and see if it got any better No such luck I havent sen his other movie Torched and I doubt if Ill bother now,negative

Jane Eyre with full frontal nudity I was not surprised to see that a woman had had a hand in this awful womans picture and I mean that in the worst possible way The trouble is it could have been so good if they had only left out the Jane Eyre stuff and stuck with the vastly more interesting scenes involving the SpanishPortuguese Jews in early 19th century London When the sound track music is better than the film you know you are in trouble When you fast forward the video because you cant stand the film just to make sure you dont miss anything you are in even worse trouble This film will end up on the romance TV channel where it rightly belongs,negative

As I post this comment IMDb currently rates Alfred Hitchcocks subpar Saboteur a 7310 Personally I rated it less than half that Honestly I cant tell how a movie this bad couldve come from what is probably the most consistently good director I know of Ive seen about 10 other Hitch movies from the 30s60s Vertigo is thus far my hands down favorite while Saboteur is easily the worst Its hard to believe that 7 years earlier Hitch used the very same formula in The 39 Steps far more competently My recommendation would be to see that instead and avoid this like the plague Its the only Hitchcock movie that I turned off before before the end and have no desire to go back and see the rest If you must watch it then rent or borrow Dont make the mistake I did and buy the DVD on good faith earned through Notorious Rebecca Vertigo Rear Window etc Even a master screws up sometimes I guessbr br EDIT Maybe I was a bit harder on this film than I shouldve been Its certainly nowhere near Ed Wood or Manos or anything like that but theres three reasons I feel I must rate it so lowbr br 1 The name Hitchcock brings with it certain expectations of quality This film delivers on a few of them but theyre way overshadowed by the darn near nonsensical plottingbr br 2 I want to compensate a bit for all the 8 ratings this film is getting Hitchcock is like the John Coltrane of directors True fans will find reasons to consider anything by him a work of art but the high rating on IMDb gives more casual movie enthusiasts like myself the impression that this movie is far better than it actually is br br 3 I spent 18 on this Maybe if itd cost me 5 or even 10 Id probably be a bit less bitter ,negative

The minute I started watching this I realised that I was watching a quality production so I was not surprised to find that the screenplay was written by Andrew Davis and was produced by Sue Birtwhistle both of these brought us the excellent 1995 production of Pride and Prejudice So my only gripe here is that Emma did not run to 3 or 4 or maybe even six episodes like Pride and Prejudice The acting was superb with I think Prunella scales excellent as Miss Bates but I loved Kate Beckinsale and Mark Strong just as much The language is a delight to listen to can you imagine in this day and age having a right go at someone without actually uttering a swear word Samantha Morton was excellent as Miss Smith in fact the casting was spot on much as it was with Pride and Prejudice I liked it so much that I watched it twice in two days So once again thank you BBC for another quality piece of television I have seen the Paltrow version and it is okay but I do think the BBC version is far superior An excellent production that I am very happy to own on DVD,positive

The best scene of The People Across The Lake is the genuinely creepy nightly openingscene featuring a house a murder  a lake After that its pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned A family mom dad sister  younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of suburbia and decides to go and live near the titular lake From then on the film features too much lame happy familyrelated doodoo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing in terms of creepiness but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goingson featuring just everydaylife stuff of the family settling in The truth to the matters the mystery as to whos doing the killing is learned too soon leaving only the family unknowing and the viewer yawning during the unexciting finale featuring a discovery in a basement and running around the house like if this madeforTV thing suddenly remembered it was supposed to be a horror film Its not really badly made the content  story is just not interesting enough The only highlight in the cast is Barry Corbin though his performancecharacter is just a bit too goofy to be taken serious Blond cutie Tammy Lauren the daughter might be a recognisable face for avid horror junkies too as she also starred in Wishmaster 1997 and madeforTV outings like I Saw What You Did 1988  The Stepford Children 1987 She hasnt got much to do in this film though Skippable but watchable if anything,negative
And the time came when the risk to remain tight in a bud was more painful than the risk it took to blossom  Anais Nin Marcel Proust says The real voyage of discovery lies in not seeing new landscapes but in having new eyes Author and screenwriter Antwone Fisher joined the US Navy to see new landscapes but the demons of his past prevented him from seeing the world through new eyes Based on his autobiography Finding Fish written many years after the events his story is dramatized in the film Antwone Fisher Denzel Washingtons first directorial effort It is a heartfelt if somewhat formulaic look at the painful process of moving from being consumed by ones past to being able to live life in present timebr br Required to attend therapy sessions after several outbursts of anger at the base the painful aspects of his childhood are shown in flashback as the grown up Antwone Derek Luke recounts his life in sessions with Navy Psychiatrist Jerome Davenport Denzel Washington He is at first unwilling to talk but when he begins the floodgates are opened After his father was shot to death by a girlfriend and Antwone was abandoned by his mother after being released from prison he was placed in a foster home where he lived for fourteen years suffering humiliation and sexual abuse According to Antwone the treatment by his foster mother Mrs Tate Novella Nelson who referred to him only as nigga and by his cousin Nadine Yolonda Ross was in fact much worse than shown on the screenbr br The only friend he has is a local by named Jesse Jascha Washington who later in the film only adds to his feelings of abandonment It is difficult to build a film around psychiatric sessions but it was done successfully in Ordinary People and Good Will Hunting with a great deal more dramatic interest but it succeeds here because of the dominant performances of Washington and Luke though the films attempt to compress eleven years into a few months seems a bit too facile Davenports humanity and warmth however allows Fisher to feel safe enough to discuss his difficult past and Cheryl Joy Bryant his new girlfriend who is also in the Navy supports him in his struggle to achieve a breakthroughbr br With Cheryls help and Dr Davenports counseling Antwone develops enough selfesteem to return to Cleveland and begin the journey to try and find his mother in order to complete the past What comes through in Derek Lukes incredible performance is Antwones longing for acceptance dramatized in a heartbreaking dream shown at the beginning of the film in which he is the guest of honor at a banquet filled with people who love him Comedian Mort Sahl once said that people just have to remember what were all here for to find our way home Antwone Fisher touches not only on the longing of one young person to find his way home but reaches all those who have cried themselves to sleep not knowing the joy of being loved,positive

Im sick of the open mind argument Im generally quite openminded but this sort of line is basically made by people who enjoy things that should not be enjoyed You know what there is a reason so many people are disgusted by this And just because someone out there isnt doesnt make it less so There is after all a reason for the existence of the feeling of disgust and no amount of open mind or pushing the envelope should eliminate that feeling Otherwise were no better than senseless living thingsbr br Back to the film Another argument is that this film puts women in the roles normally reserved for men which may be why men dont like it But just because it proves revolting for more men than would otherwise doesnt make it great Maybe men shouldnt be turned on by whats dominating the movie industry but is the answer for women to do the same Maybe if you dont like movies TV and entertainment having so much sexual objectification of women so much violence dont watch thembr br And if youre a director dont make thembr br Otherwise some day someone will ask for an open mind when what happened in this movie happen in real lifebr br Heck some people seem to like it so much,negative
If you are looking for a film the portrays the pointless and boring existence of middle class lives caught in a web of noncommunication and false ideals then this is the film for you If you also what the film to be engaging and keep your interest then you should probably look elsewhere There are many films that do this far better For example try some of the darker films by Bergman The Filmmaker felt that in order to show the spiritual poverty of the middle class he should subject the viewer to one agonizingly dull and vacuous incident after another until the film finally comes to its tortuous and pathetic end If you value your time there are far better ways to spend two hours like cleaning your house for example,negative

This film is superb Wesley Snipes Plays Blade the vampire hunter with pure class he kicks butt in such a fluid and violent way that would make Bruce Lee proud The movie is a fast paced thrill ride of action and superb stunts The first action scene and last are outstanding and Wesley looks like a Terminator as he runs around wiping out all suck heads The script is pretty good and there is sharp dialogue too Wesley should have done more action films than he has i know he is a very good actor and in this he is not streched as much as in his more comic or drama roles but as far as action stars go he is the best actor of them all only Bruce Willis Stallone and perhaps Tom Cruise if he counts as an action star come close Also aswell as Wesley being quality Steven Dorff is also very good as the bad guy It was an unexpected surprise that someone of small stature compared to Snipes should come across as menacing but he does Overall the film is sharp stylish and i hope the sequal is done with the same sort of pace,positive
Ken Harrison a young sculptor in his early thirties is seriously injured in a road accident End of storybr br End of story that is in the sense of end of any physical action Not in the sense of end of the film Kens life is saved but he is paralysed from the neck down When he discovers that he is unlikely ever to regain the use of his limbs he decides that he wants to die and asks the doctors to end the medical treatment which is keeping him alive The rest of the film is essentially one long debate about the rights and wrongs of euthanasia and the right to diebr br Kens main antagonist in this debate is his doctor Michael Emerson Although the case against euthanasia is often presented in religious terms here it is presented in purely secular ones If Dr Emerson has any deep religious convictions these are never expressed in the film He believes passionately however that death is an enemy against which it is his duty as a doctor to fight to allow a patient effectively to take his own life would represent a surrender to that enemy and a dereliction of that duty Ken therefore finds himself in a Catch22 situation He must be able to show that he is sane and rational enough to make the decision to end his life Emerson however considers that a wish to die is in itself evidence of insanity and irrationality Kens dilemma can only be solved by hiring a lawyer to sue the hospitalbr br Richard Dreyfuss as Ken and John Cassavetes as Dr Emerson put across their respective points of view skilfully and with sincerity but this cannot hide the fact that Whose Life is it Anyway simply does not work as a film At one time filmed versions of stage plays were done in a similar way to theatrical productions but by the seventies and eighties this was often seen as unsatisfactory because of the differences between the two media When plays were filmed therefore the general tendency was to open them up by filming on location as well as on studio sets by taking liberties with the playwrights text often making significant changes to the plot and even introducing extra charactersbr br I have never seen Brian Clarkes play but I suspect that this is a story that would work better in the theatre than in the cinema There is very little physical action most of the action consists of lengthy discussions around a hospital bed in which the main character lies paralysed Such a plot does not lend itself to the opening up device at all and the resulting film is very static dominated by talk at the expense of action Although it is well written and there is some good acting I am surprised that a film was ever made of such an uncinematic subject 410,negative

This film was a critical and boxoffice fiasco back in 1957 It was based on a novel which was later turned into a playwhich flopped on Broadway The story is about some navy officers on leave in San Francisco during WWII They have 4 days leave which they spend at the Mark Hopkins hotel The film meanders a lot and none of the characters seem very real Cary Grant is generally brilliant in comedy and dramabut here he plays a sort of wheeler dealer and he doesnt really pull it off Tony Curtis or James Garner would have been better choices Audrey Hepburn was initially set to play opposite Grant but had other commitmentsso Suzy parker stepped in She had never acted before but was Americas top photographic model at the time I think that she did a good job considering all the pressure that she was under Grants pairing with Jayne Mansfield in a few brief scenesdid not really work The Studio was trying to give her some class by acting with Grantbut the character had no substance at all,negative

I loved this movie when I was a kid I saw it theatrically Randy Edelman did a good composition of the soundtrack David Seville is the Chipmunks father and recording manager The Chipmunks consist of Alvin who is best known for playing the harmonica Simon who is a bright and studious chipmunk  Theodore who is the youngest and is always hungry There is a lady known as Miss Miller who looks after the chipmunks and has 3 daughters known as Brittany Jeanette  Eleanor who all have the same character as the Chipmunks My favourite songs from this soundtrack include Diamond Dolls The Girls of Rock  Roll  the touching My Mother Alvin really wanted to see Europe when Dave had to go there for business The Chipmunks meet the Chipettes playing the Around the World in 30 days video game which led them to race each other doing the real thing,positive

I watched this movie and the original Carlitos Way back to back The difference between the two is disgusting Now i know that people are going to say that the prequel was made on a small budget but that never had anything to do with a bad script Now maybe its just me but i always thought that a prequel was made to go set up the other movie starring key characters and maybe filling in a bit about life that we didnt know Rise to Power is just a movie that has Carlitos name There should have been at least a few characters from the original movie the ending makes no sense in relation to the original In the end of this movie he retires with his sweet heart but how the hell do we get him coming out of prison in the next movie And his woman isnt even the same woman that he talks about as his only love in the original I would say the movie is mildly entertaining in its self with a few decent bits but it pales when held up to its big brother Dont lay awake at night waiting to see this watch the original one more time if you really need a hit,negative

One of Boris Karloffs real clinkers Essentially the dying Karloff looking about 120 years older than he wasis a scientist in need of cash to finish his experiments before he dies Moving from Morocco where his funding is taken over by someone else he goes to the South of France where he works a s physician while trying to scrap enough money to prove his theories Desperate for money he makes a deal with the young rich wife of a cotton baron who is dying She will fund him if he helps her poison the husband so she can take his money and carry on with a gigolo who I think is married If you think I got that from watching the movie youre wrong I had to read what other people posted to figure out happened Why because this movie had me lost from two minutes inI had no idea what was going on with its numerous characters and multiple converging plot lines Little is spelled out and much isnt said until towards the end by which time I really didnt care Its a dull mess of interest purely for Karloffs performance which is rather odd at times To be honest this is the only time Ive ever seen him venture into Bela Lugosi bizarre territory Its not every scene but a few and makes me wonder how much they hung out,negative
Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography I can hardly say anything positive about this movie The single real issue is the protagonists dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life Abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere The director only manages to introduce Anthonys dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution The characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for Sonny Beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come off as selfindulging amateurs I wonder what ruined the movie more the superficial script throwing away all the potential of the plot or the bad acting disturbing any appeal that might be left,negative
Although promoted as one of the most sincere Turkish films with an amateur cast Icecream I Scream is more like a caricature of sinceritybr br The plot opens with the dream of Ali a traveling icecream salesman in a Western Anatolia town in which he sees himself becoming successful using the same marketing methods of big icecream companies He dreams of playing in his products TV commercial with beautiful models in bikinis dancing around him As his dream turns into a nightmare he wakes up with a big erection next to his gargantuan wife who rejects to make sex with him for 6 years with no apparent reason Is it because he is not successful in his job Apparently because he says he was selling better in the old days when there was no pressure from global icecream companies But this is what he says we actually dont see him suffer that much he still sells good traveling the neighboring villages while his apprentice stays at the shop selling icecream to the people in the town Ali blames big companies for using sweetening and coloring agents while he is using real sahlep powdered roots of mountain orchids Ali buys a motorbike with a bank loan to be a traveling vendor and gives ads to a local TV channel which prefers to broadcast even the news bulletin in local dialect His wife is not fond of his ways of doing business they always quarrel and Ali threatens her that he may do very bad things in a moment of frenzybr br In a very successful day his lousy bike is stolen by the misbehaving little boys of the town In search of his stolen bike Ali goes to the police blames the big companies for the theft but of course nobody takes him seriously Annoyed by the nagging of his wife Ali goes to a tavern and becomes drunk One of his friends at his table a wannabe socialist of the town gives a didactic speech and criticizes globalism and with no real connection jumps to the subject of global freezing Ali returns home and decides to kill himself with poison His wife wakes up and prevents him An old neighbor takes him to a night walk and advises him about life According to him Ali can even sell hot sahlep drink if the world faces with global freezing When he returns home suddenly we see that his wife understood his value treating him like a hero and praising his manhood Meanwhile the thief boys got sick eating too much icecream They confess to the doctor that they stole Alis bike Ali forgives them and there comes the happy endbr br Although the plot may look promising in a way its the storytelling which makes this film insincere and cheesy First the director doesnt show much of an effort to tell the story visually everything is based on dialogs And the dialogs never stop to show us that cinema is actually a visual art Even Alis troubles are not convincing because we dont see it we just understand it from his words The director markets his film as a righteous fight of Ali against big icecream companies but there is nothing in the film about big companies We dont see their pressure enough The film actually ridicules Ali for believing that big companies are behind the theft And when his motorbike is found it solves every problem Ali becomes a happy and powerful husband Not a real criticism of globalismbr br Second the film is cheesy because of the crude humor Maybe the people of that part of Turkey is cursing so much and making so many vulgar jokes in their daily life but vulgar language and crude humor are not enough to make a film funny I may have accepted it if they were both vulgar and clever but they are not clever jokes at all they are just cheesy Maybe Im wrong maybe American people may like oriental version of American Pie style humor But American Pie never had any claim to be a nominee for the Oscars or to have a political message If you think that you can laugh by just seeing a mans big erection in his shorts and we had to endure this joke twice or an old villager woman saying fk you then you may find this film funny,negative
AristoCats is such a terrific Disney classic that I just loved so much as a kid Still to this day I cant resist watching it its just such a wonderful and charming film with great animation and lovely songs I really miss the animation films like AristoCats they had perfect voices not to mention the hand drawn animation that makes it perfect for the family AristoCats is also very witty and clever the story was just so wonderful This film is just beyond irresistible I think the most memorable moment for me was the cats playing the piano learning the appecios lol it was just so cute with the piano playing and paintingbr br Douchess and her kittens are very pampered in their huge mansion mainly because their lady is very rich and treats them like they were her children But when the lady feels its time to make her will she leaves everything to the cats and not to her butler The butler gets angry and takes the kittens on the road and abondons them in the middle of no where Douchess and the kittens wake up and with the help of a smooth street cat by the name of Thomas OMalley they head back home to their lady but learn the coolness of being a skat catbr br The AristoCats is just a perfect Disney movie that I feel is a bit over looked I would always highly recommend this movie for kids or families it could be enjoyed by anyone The songs and story is just memorable I will always join in for the movies best song Everybody wants to be a cat such a great tune I also love those dogs that guarded the farm where the cats were abandoned they were just so cute This is a terrific film please watch it you wont be disappointedbr br 910,positive

I was excited to hear that someone had made a documentary on what it was like to be Puerto Rican When I heard it was Rosie Perez I wonderedcould she possibly know what it is really like to be Puerto Rican As far as I knewshe was a Nuyorican Well anyway I anxiously sat with my popcorn to watch I realized 10 min into it that my initial apprehension was right Rosie Perez has little knowledge about what it is like to be Puerto Rican This documentary is more a 1st hand very very personal account on what it is like to be a Nuyoricanand all of what that entails She like most of the Nuyoricans I know have a watered down partial and sometimes twisted sense of history How could they notthey live here Yes all of them are proud As they should be But a lot dont know the ins and outs of the REAL culture history and political background or language for the most part It all became very very apparent with her participation in the Vieques issue Regardless of my personal take is on this issueat least I know what the hell the fight is for There is she is getting arrested for something she knew little about and only participated in because it was a Puerto Rican Cause I really dont understand how she is not embarrassed to admit to it For those of you that are not Puerto Rican please view this as a partial account of a womans journey of self discovery and acceptance Do not take this as gospela lot of it isnt even true Please consider the source Rosie is an actress not a historian This movie is not and should never be for other Nuyoricans the base for their information Instead just a step towards finding more info learning and debating what the reality is Not just the one coming from this womans eyes,negative

Hey now I cant claim to have seen all of the films of Jesse Jesus Franco and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that I have seen Id say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixtiesearly seventies and anything lately has been a bit TOO strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that Anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points This woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in Berlin where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative audience  and she seems to have this problem with dreaming The catch to whats real and whats not in this movie is apparently the real stuff is in sharp focus and the dream stuff isnt She seems to exist in a state of deja vu I wont say this makes a whole lot of sense but it is pretty wild and weird and entertaining Shots of Berlin make it seem like a lonely and creepy place so that adds to the atmosphere The ending is extremely abrupt though the film just ends and the tape went black I guess no need to let you know it was over at that point My copy was from the Anchor Bay EuroTrash collection and I say give me more EuroTrash I cant get enough of that crap But its GOOD crap,positive
Surface from the day its teaser first showed in the summer of 2005 was a tossup On one hand it seemed so highconcept and plot driven that to the passerby it felt like it would work out better as a motion picture or several Plus it felt like it was NBCs attempt at a Lostkiller On the other hand one may have realized that the story was too expansive to tell in a movie or two and fans of Lost seemed intriguedbr br So after one and possibly only season on NBC the show is on an indefinite hiatus that could either put it in the vault on Scifi or filling a gap in NBCs lineup in the summer or fall of 2007 or beyond Its ratings were some of the better on the network which isnt saying much but the show has been taken off the air with no real official announcement of its futurebr br So is it worthwhile Yesbr br Surface follows a continuing story format driven by plot with next to no filler episodes Almost everything that happens on the show is important to the plot much like a motion picture No filler episodes which put a pain in your side when you missed an episode Yet the shows doubleedge helped made up for that Big things seem to happen every episode but since it feels like a movie you end every episode feeling like little happened and youre left wanting more That trait of the show though shows how great it is The cast is solid the three main leads including the beautiful Lake Bell as Laura Daughtery put in a solid performance every episode each driven by their own reasons for findingstudying the creatures The supporting cast including Ian Anthony Dale and the brief performance by Rade Serbedzija fill out the cast well The story is slow to start my one regret it doesnt really pick up until a 34 episodes in to the short 15episode season but the latter half of the season makes up for it The visual effects are stunning ones jaw will drop when you see an overhead view of one of the creatures attack a ship as wellbr br Many of the shows problems can be remedied by purchasing the complete first season and not having to wait a week or three to watch the next episodebr br In short if youve missed the first season and youre curious go back and watch it Its no Twin Peaks in terms of quirkiness but the highconcept nature of it puts in in league with that Lost and other similar shows with a flair for action and adventure Enjoy it,positive

I found this flick enjoyable and involving to watch and Im surprised its rated so lowly Actually I can see why it is I imagine its the fans of Eric Roberts and Alyssa Milano that have been giving most of the 1s and 2s because if you put the tape into the machine expecting to enjoy watching something starring either or both of these two then you could be rather disappointed Eric appears for about half an hour towards the end of the movie and Alyssa for about 5 scenes in the second half and in those she says little and wears less although never nude if thats what youre looking for stick with embrace of the vampire Although theyre always a pleasure its a pity she or Eric dont get much screentime yet I still give this an 8br br ,positive

Here is the example of a film that was not well received when it was made but whose standing seems to be raising in time The Tenant is quite an interesting work by Polanski one of the first of his European exile It is set in Paris and as in so many other exile films the city its streets the Seine and especially the building where the action takes place play an important role It is just that Polanski chooses his principal character not to be an American as in Frantic for example but a Pole as himself was when going West There is actually a lot of personal commentary in this film made at what must have been a time of crisis in the directors life and the fact that he decided to play the lead role and does it masterfully may also be seen as some kind of exorcismbr br Its in a way a circular story The hero named Trelkovsky rents an apartment in old Parisian building inhabited by what seem to be first a well assorted team of grumpy old or just ridiculous neighbors The previous tenant tried to commit suicide by jumping out of the window of the flat and Trelkovsky has just the time to visit her in the hospital before she dies and meet there her young and beautiful friend Stella a spectacled Isabelle Adjani in her first role after Truffauts Lhistoire dAdele H Soon the neighbors do not seem to be what they are its a conspiracy to make him crazy or to make him enter the life and role of the dead girl He fights tries to run enters the game and ends by entering the circle and slowly becoming her The circle is closedbr br Its not the most believable story we may have seen or heard but the strength of the film does not reside in the story but in the details of the psychology in the slow degradation of the mental state of the hero in the permanent balancing game between reality and delusion To a certain extent it is not what happens on the screen that matters but how it happens reminding the classical Knife in the Water made more than a decade before at the end of the Polish period of Polanski There are many details that are never explained but then this is how mystery films must be and this is actually how life is sometimes The feeling of claustrophobia slowly contaminates the viewer Unfortunately some of the graphical details in the last part of the film are not too well executed and the English spoken dialogs the film was made in English almost neutralize the overall atmosphere However waiting for the final punch scene is very worth the patiencebr br Its not the best film that Polanski made yet has many good parts it shows the hand and the style of the director and was a significant step in the building of his career,positive

This movie has too many things going on Another reviewer comments on the disjointed episodic nature of the film as reflecting the directors memories  thats fine if that is how it was written and performed Instead what we get is straightforward narrative  some of the time  that jumps around under and over leaves us dangling in some instances interrupts the flow with unnecessary digressions in other instances and otherwise simply doesnt work br br There are also some plot details that just dont work For example why drag a body onto a beach in an urban area in broad daylight as opposed to night time Why leave your flat sheet on the body Why would an artist who knew the Joe character for a brief time decide to leave him everything even if it wasnt much This subplot was poorly developed to make that point work For that matter why even have the man be an invalid or an artist other than to provide the money and the gratuitous nude posing scenes He could just as easily have been a photographer or a opera composer For that matter how does someone rate an apartment in an Opera House  particularly without some clear connection to the Opera The coincidences are also both too obvious and to unclear and unexplained Why would the guys take everything in the warehouse and disappear If Tim was a 10 year old school mate in a town as small as Bangor how could Joe lose track of him for 8 years especially if they knew each other well enough that one would recommend the other for a job br br Some of the other subplots like the mother and her boyfriends and the sister wanting to escape felt like padding Theres some good ideas that might have made a feature with full development or could have been interesting shorts As completed this movie made little sense and offers even less,negative
Well I saw this movie during the last San Sebastian Film Festival The reaction to it waslets say as funny as the movie unintetionally is It happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles They seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish It was all confusing the genders were switched girls appeared as boys and boys as girls and my friends and I remember great lines but because they were so absurd All in all not a good movie but if they ever show it on tv and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh again not so much with the movie then go ahead Visible secret is your film,negative

Killer Flood The Day the Damn Broke 110 Finally a movie whose title is spoiler proof Even by the low standards of disaster movies excuse me allow me to correct myself even by the low standards of made for TV disaster movies this is truly awful Where do I begin br br The dam modeler may have once seen a photo of a dam but I doubt it Most dams especially large ones that generate electricity have oh I dont know a power plant nearby some sluice gates for water to run through heck even a high tension electrical wire or two br br The dam is also somewhat understaffed Two count them two employees staff the entire dam all three shifts And the employees were apparently imported from a clichéd ridden world war two film as they heroically and rather needlessly have long eulogized death scenes complete with photos of grandchildrenn floating by Heck one of them manages to get shot by the dam itself in a way that defies description br br The special effects consist of flowing water superimposed on photos of the town in a method that makes a sixties Godzilla film look like the Matrix A threeyearold drawing with a blue crayon on the film stock would have yielded better results Since the disaster money shots are worthless how is the rest of the film br br Needless to say the script and acting follow the special effects lead This is no diamond in the rough This is the rough So is it a guilty pleasure Killer Flood is awful enough to generate some laughs and the film itself has that earnest incompetence that makes a good cult classic but bad disaster films need to age like a fine wine Avalanche The Swarm Meteor It is also doubtful that Michelle Green hiding from the flood in a dumpster with a golden retriever will ever match the great Henry Fonda being pelted by raisins that are supposed to be killer bees Check back with me in 2024,negative
Disgused as an Asian Horror A Tale Of Two Sisters is actually a complex character driven psychological drama that engulfs the viewer into the problems of a seemingly normal family I was really surprised at the depth of this movie Director Jiwoon Kims decision to focus more on telling a story rather than providing cheap scares has proved a correct one Creating one of the most ingenious new horror moviesbr br A Tale Of Two Sisters tels the story as its name suggest of two sisters Sumi and the younger Suyeon who after spending time in a mental institution return home to their father and apparently abusive stepmother From then on we witness how the sisters deal with their stepmothers gradually rising aggression and erratic behavior To say what would happen next would be to be spoil the entire experience So Ill just leave it at thatbr br The plot is very tightly written With the characters nicely fleshed out Jiwoon Kims focus on a small cast offers a much more detailed view on them and their relations to one another Furthermore each of the four main cast has a vastly different role and type of character From the protective Sumi the weaker Suyeon the visibly uninterested father to the stepmothers frantic and later deadly behavior There is great sense of mystery with a lot of the plot not revealed up into the end and even after that the movie still leaves a great room for interpretation Even after watching it once the viewer will be compelled to see it at least once more so that he can gain a better understanding to itbr br The actors superbly fit their roles It is especially hard to create strong emotional scenes in psychological movies but it is a great joy when one succeeds in creating them and this is a prime example of such a feat Jiwoon Kims direction is slow paced and gripping building up tension for the films horroresque scenes While few in number those moments are strong and quite frankly terrifying The cinematography and score are top notch further helping to establish an atmosphere fitting that of a psychological filmbr br A Tale Of Two Sisters is a demonstration how the horror genre is in fact so much more than a simple thrill ride With its strong focus on character and mystery this is one complex movie that could easily seduce you in watching it again and again just so that you can understand it better,positive
I really liked this movie  but the ads I saw implied and one published review actually said that this movie benefits from a light touch That to me is very misleadingbr br There is indeed plenty of humor eccentric unsubtle sometimes somewhat twisted humor the kind of humor I generally find very appealing indeed But most of the humor is the kind that appears conscious at all times of things deeply serious deeply sensitive even deeply painful The movie weaves together themes of Past and Present Perception and Truth Memory and Activity Life and Death The entire movie is suffused by the history of European antiSemiticism in general and of the Holocaust in particularbr br How can Humor and Horror be combined in the same movie The review I saw suggested that the humor is Absurdist I dont think this is the case at all at least not in the common sense Instead I think this movie stands in the tradition of much Jewish  Yiddish literature and theatre I dont claim to be any kind of expert in this area but from what Ive seen Humor is used in this cultural context both as a coping tool for the horribly tragic experiences of this people and also Humor is used as a means of recovering the Divine for men and women who choose a path of Faith rather than a path of either Despair or Absurdism See Fiddler on the Roof for Humor used in both ways in this rich traditionbr br Elijah Wood Jonathon Wood wears horn rimmed glasses that really make him look well strange compare Sin City when he wore the same kinds of glasses with chilling effect In this movie its easy to see how the glasses become a metaphor for both his Search and for his Struggle between Perception and Truth Eugene Hutz Young Alex and Boris Lesking Old Alex are both really just wonderful Jonathon and Young Alex are from the same generation yet seem so very very different and then find that they are not so different after all And the way in which the Apparent Narrative Voice changes gradually from that of Jonathon to that of Young Alex  as a journey of intended discovery for Jonathon becomes one of discovery for both Young Alex and Old Alex  is to me so very movingbr br There are some wonderful scenes and panoramas from Im told Prague and environs standing in for the Ukraine of the story line All feels very authentic and seems to give a wonderful sense of place although Ive never been myself to the Ukraine and can hardly testify to this from first hand experiencebr br All in all if youre looking for light comedy I would not recommend this movie at all On the other hand if you are interested in a wonderful delightful and deeply moving film please check out this wonderful movie,positive

I wasnt alive in the 60s so I cant guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience There are some excellent performances most notably by Josh Hamilton of With Honors Jerry OConnell Sliders who play brothers divided by the war Bill Smitrovich a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heartfilled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Vietnam but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite All in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film that I hope everyone gets a chance to experience,positive
I am not one of those people who just go online after I see a movie and decide to call it the worst movie ever made If you doubt me please look at my other reviews However for the first time ever I have seen a movie so horrible that I wanted to write about how bad it was before it was even overbr br I LOVE bad movies To me Ed Wood is a genius I thought Bloody Murder Jeepers Creepers and most horrible horror movies were good However there is not a single good thing I can say about this filmbr br The plot is basically non existent If someone reading my review wastes their money to see it they can discern for themselves what the plot might be but I advise you that a nickel would be worth more than watching this moviebr br The special effects are badbr br The acting is badbr br The two leads are attractive but thats all there isbr br I am not the type to spoil a movie for anyone but I INVITE anyone to email me at foxbarkingyahoocom to ask for my opinion on this movie before they waste a dime on it I will tell you anythingbr br I love bad movies and I love horror and I love new inventive movies I even love horror porn stuff like Hostel Which some reviewers claimed this was like but obviously they only thought so cause Roger Bart was in this and Hostel 2 But this may be the Number 1 most worthless and stupid and dumbass movie EVER madebr br And before you disregard this review this is coming from someone who not only sat through the ENTIRE premiere of House of the Dead but actually bought a copy of it,negative
Universal Studios version of Flipper 1996 is a great heartwarming film for the entire family with good values and sentimentality It is the story of Sandy Ricks a teenager from Chicago who reluctantly spends his vacation with his Uncle Porter Ricks in the Bahamas This ultimately changes the teenagers life and he grows up in the process He learns to appreciate nature and to have a respect for the environment I grew up in the 1960s and the NBC television show Flipper was my favorite childhood show Elijah Wood is perfectly cast as a 1990s Sandy Ricks and gives an excellent performance As much as I liked the NBC television show and MGM theatrical feature films with Luke Halpin as Sandy in the 1960s I liked this feature the best I feel Elijah Wood is the best Sandy Ricks With respect to Luke Halpin I feel Elijah Wood has more of a range of acting talent and emotes more as an actor which makes his performance excellent and more believable I think Elijah Wood is the best young actor working today in films Director Alan Shapiro also wrote the screenplay and has done an excellent job as both writer and director of this film Paul Hogan gives a comical and likable performance as Sandys Uncle Porter Ricks Mr Hogans performance perfectly offsets Elijahs role as Sandy I am a big fan of underwater films This film was beautifully shot in the Bahamas like Thunderball 1965 UA was The director of photography was Bill Butler ASC who lensed the film Jaws in 1975 Mr Butler is a very talented cinematographer The underwater director of photography was Pete Romano He did a superb job with the underwater cinematography I enjoyed the film score by Joel McNeely This good film score featured Crosby Stills and Nash among other talented artists This motion picture was shot in Panavision like Thunderball in the aspect ratio of 2351 If possible try to see this film in a scope version as originally framed and visioned by Alan Shapiro and Bill Butler Another very nice thing is that Mr Shapiro gave the original Sandy Ricks Luke Halpin a small part in this remake He portrayed Bounty Fisherman 3 in this film This was a very kind gesture on Mr Shapiros part As you can tell I am a real true fan of this film Sadly this beautiful film was met with harsh words by the majority of movie critics I originally saw this movie on my birthday May 31st of 1996 in a movie theater It meant a lot to me I have it on numerous video versions The VHS versions are in pan and scan The laserdisc version is letterboxed 2351 I even have a VCD in 2351 from Hong Kong which is letterboxed But my most prized possession is an original 16mm theatrical feature print which I will treasure for the rest of my life Thank you Mr Shapiro Elijah Wood Paul Hogan and everyone involved for making this a memorable movie for me to enjoybr br PS I must add that the quality of the Universal DVD is superb It is the best DVD as far as quality I have ever seen The color and resolution is spectacular The soundtrack is great I think Universal must have used the same transfer for the DVD that they did for the laserdisc version The 35mm scope print is mint and Alans film really has a wonderful look to it A great tribute to a wonderful film The DVDs resolution is even superior to the laserdisc quality Its just spectacular Thank you Universal Home Video for the great quality control and transfer Many thanks for doing a superb job on this wonderful family film Also many thanks to you Alan for all your extreme kindness to me Its a real honor to know you Review RevisedUpdated June 27 2005,positive
I have no idea what idiots gave this movie a Palm DOr at the 1999 Cannes Film Festival because it was atrocious I actually watched the entire thing simply because I couldnt believe that someone would make such a worthless film There is nothing interesting about the plot the characters are devoid of depth and there is no attempt at giving any sort of ambiance with music or sound effects Also if you do decide to waste 2 hours of your life by watching this film be sure to bring something to throw up in because the cinematography is simply someone running around with a handheld camcorder and half the time you cant even see the main subjects This style has been used much more successfully in movies such as Blair Witch because it creates suspense In Rosetta there is no plot and no suspense to which that style would lend anything I should have known better when it came on at 2 oclock in the morning that it was going to be horrible,negative

The Soap is an interesting movie and very brilliant at parts You must watch it for its strong characterisation and the risks the plot about two troubled individuals falling in love takes You must know the story through various other reviews so lets speak about what is brilliant about this moviebr br Firstly the two protagonists are so real and such intriguing personalities The first being a woman who has opted out of a four year relationship and is angry enough to sleep with anyone coming her way The second being a man who has always wanted to be a woman whose pain and loneliness is shown with so much sensitivity and brilliance You hate the former and your heart bleeds for the latterbr br The second thing about this movie is the entire concept of loving one for who one is irrespective of gender So would you still love your partner if heshe were to change hisher sex The movie explores that idea and it is a beautiful onebr br But there is one point where the movie fails I wish the relationship between the protagonists had developed in a better way That what they feel is love doesnt come across till the end But watch it and post your thoughts on it here,positive
Last night I finished rewatching Jane Eyre 1983 the BBC miniseries adapted from Charlotte Brontes Gothic romance novel which is deservingly a classic of English literature with Timothy Dalton my favorite James Bond as Mr Edward Rochester and Zelah Clarke as Jane Eyre a poor orphaned 18yearold girl a governess at Mr Rochesters estate Thornfield Jane Eyre has been one of my most beloved books since I was an 11yearsold girl and the friend of mine gave it to me with the words This book is amazing and so it was and I have read it dozens of times and I am still not tired of it Its beautiful language refined fragrant and surprisingly fresh the dialogs and above all two main characters and the story of their impossible love have attracted many filmmakers Jane Eyre has been adapted to TV and big screen many times 18 according to IMDb The actors as famous and marvelous as Joan Fontaine and Orson Welles William Hurt and Charlotte Gainsbourg George C Scott and Susannah York Ciarán Hinds and Samantha Morton have played the couple that had overcome hundreds of obstacles made by society laws religion by the differences in age backgrounds experiences and by the fateful mistakes that would hunt one for many years Of all these films Ive only seen one 300 minutes long BBC version from 1983 that follows the novel closely and where Timothy Dalton who frequently plays dark brooding characters did not just play Edward Rochester brilliantly and with class he WAS Mr Rochester  sardonic vibrant the force of nature powerful passionate sexy and tormented master of Thornfield Zelah Clarke was also convincing as sweet gentle intelligent and strong Jane who feels deeply and is full of passion mixed with clear reasoning and quiet but firm willpowerbr br Added on September 17 2007 During the last two weeks Ive seen five Jane Eyre movies and it was a wonderful experience There is something to admire in every adaptation of Jane Eyre even if not all of them are completely successful This version is still my favorite Jane Eyre film,positive

Ill keep this one quite short I believe that this is an extraordinary movie I see other reviewers who have commented to the effect that its badly written poorly shot has a terrible soundtrack and worse that its not real in its portrayal of life OK so it may not be quite believable for its whole length but this movie carries a message of hope which some others seemed to have missed Hope that it isnt too late to save people from the terrible things that go on in so many lives Gangland violence is real right Is it right no This movie carries an important social message which the cynics may dislike but which nonetheless is to be praised rather than denigrated I have watched this movie with great enjoyment at least eight times each time with equal enjoyment and each time with the feeling that maybe the world could be made better and is not beyond saving well not until 2008 anyway 9 out of 10 from me for this one Its very nearly perfect in my view JMV,positive

I was fortunate to attend the London premier of this film While I am not at all a fan of British drama I did find myself deeply moved by the characters and the BAD CHOICES they made I was in tears by the end of the film Every scene was mesmerizing The attention to detail and the excellent acting was quite impressivebr br I would have to agree with some of the other comments here which question why all these women were throwing themselves at such a despicable characterbr br SPOLIER ALERT I was also hoping that Dylan would have been killed by William when he had the chance END SPOILERbr br Keira Knightley did a great job and radiate beauty and innocence from the screen but it was Sienna Millers performance that was truly Oscar worthybr br I am sure this production will be nominated for other awards,positive
This telecast of the classic musical Sweeney Todd does not do the production justice but is still quite enthrallingbr br Firstly the most enjoyable aspect of this version is the production design from the wheeling multiset to the startling trapdoor Then the staging is excellent right down to the slashingbr br The main failing here is in the performances people give Oh theyre believable all right but it is quite frustrating when nobody seems to be hitting their cues on time in a song as fastpaced as say Kiss Me In fact the actress playing Johanna is not only offtempo to a dismal degree but also slightly offkey And Angela Lansburys slightly overdone cockney accent is a bit irritating One more thing too what exactly is so bad about Judge Turpins performance of Johanna that it is banned from the American theatre but not the cannibal anthem A Little Priestbr br Otherwise this is an excellent production Its a thrill to watch people do what they love and Im not even peripherally talking about meat pies with a twist,positive

You have to understand when Wargames was released in 1983 it created a generation of wannabe computer hackers The idea that a teenager could do anything of far reaching proportions let alone deter a world war was novel and thrilling Real computers were beginning to show up in peoples homes and for the first time society was becoming interconnected in a way that made the movies premise excitingly prescient Granted a talking computer that balanced its free time between chess and global thermonuclear war was a bit far fetched but the brilliant commentary on nuclear proliferation and the cold war made up for it Ive probably even heard of the hackers that this movie was actually based onbr br Fast forward 25 years and we have a horrible mutant of a thing that I loathe to call a sequel called Wargames The Dead Code Ill just dig right in First of all the plot hinges on a government operated gambling site where folks who win the games automatically become terror suspects Youre probably very confused right now The idea is that eventually the terrorist will click on the subgame within the web site called The Dead Code where they pilot a plane over a city spraying it with bioweapons At some point in the game you have to choose between sarin gas and anthrax and if you choose sarin then youre automatically confirmed as a bioterrorism weapons expert and your family is taken into custody and interrogated In the movie this actually happens However since the payment for the game was made from a bank account that was suspicious it obviously all makes sensebr br Second the avatar of the AI in this straighttoDVD bomb is an annoying flash animation that keeps repeating the popupadesquire sound bite play with me baby Because apparently in the future advanced AI loses interest in intellectual pursuits like chess and gets into pornbr br Third the motivation for these hackers is profit and women as opposed to pure curiosity as in the original movie For some reason recent hacker movies feel the need to portray all young adults as average surfer dude kind of people who are just like everyone else That may work for your average sitcom but cmon you dont learn how to take over government computers by doing your hair playing sports and shopping at the mall folks The one novel thing I noticed was that at some point in the dialogue there is a reference to a Matt Damon movie and then later there is the phrase Good Hunting Will I swear they named the main character Will just for that phrase so they could send a high five to Mr Damon This Will kid isnt bad but he was certainly wasnt like any obsessive hacker Ive ever met I cant fully state how annoyed I am that this movie shares the same name as the original because it has absolutely nothing in common with it except Professor Falken and Joshua WOPR make a reappearance in this movie as a limp old man who apparently is dying of boredom and a dilapidated old tictactoe machine with a higher pitched voice After some prodding Joshua the AI has what appears to be sex with the new AI with the porn voice a bunch of board games flash on the big screens and the whole The only way to win is not to play revelation is supposed to be the crowning moment Except that those of us who saw the original you know those who would want to see this in the first place have already been there and done that A recycled ending for a movie made from last months compostbr br The new movie was directed by a guy whos done 90210 and written by guys who do B movies The original was directed by a guy whos been keeping himself busy with Heroes so you see the quality difference there There was talk of a real remake but I hope they dont destroy this classic all over again I swear if I have to Ill visit every gambling web site until I find the one thats run by a psychotic government computer The saving grace is that I was able to stream this on Netflix so at least the only energy I expended watching this disaster was for breathing clicking and indigestion,negative

Okayits 2005 and when you finally get to look at this film you will probably exclaim that it is dated But heres the thing the screenplay was bold the exposure of the music industry at that time was as bold as welland it took some time for this to get music that was created by African Americans to be promoted on the same level as white acts In some cases it still is  but back in the 70s this film addressed some of the background many never knew Now weve got American Idol  Pop Idol and other such things that allow us into the minds of the record execs and how they think they should market something that sells and not market talentbr br When I was a kid I loved the Earth Wind and Fire release of Thats the Way of the World which contained some of their biggest hits Shining Star Reasons Yeanin Learnin and the title Little did I know this was a SOUNDTRACK of a MOVIEuntil I moved to Los Angeles and got the wonderful Z Channelbr br The Z Channel showed this film as part of a Harvey Keitel retrospective Gee I had no idea Harvey Keitel DID so many movies  and when I saw this one I was surprised This movie is not a cinematic masterpiece but it does deserve more merit than it got Its a nice little film More than a vanity piece for Earth Wind and Fire Harvey Keitel does a great job as a torn record executive trying to fight the system There are a lot of lessons to be drawn from this and a lot of insider trade that was exposedbr br If you can find this uncutits worth a look,positive

Our Family and friends enjoyed this movie very much The theme was well handled by the Director with great performances from Shabana Azmi Konkana Sen and well supported by good performances from the other cast The climax was built well but for the ending which was a far from being called Good We are still trying to understand what was the Director trying to convey Were they short of ideas or was the ending beyond the understanding of common movie lovers A better ending would have created a lasting impression on the audience and increased the viewership This however should not take away credit that is due to Konkana and Shabana Azmi for relating so well with the characters,positive
The original title always struck me as a rather overblown definition for a bunch of guntoting saddletramps Still their screen presence was at least underscored by a topquality group of actors to support Yul Brynner Most were movie stars in their own rightbr br However this first sequel was a pale imitation with a group now composed of largely B and C list players who were more mediocre than magnificent It was a similar setup Brynners Chris had to recruit yet another team of guntoting saddletramps to sort out the Mexican peasants problems again Another tyrant was giving them griefbr br With the originality and freshness of the first movie now spent this remake had little else to offer The budget was evidently very limited This was reflected not only in the cast but also in the belowpar script which borrowed much from the earlier classic It was also more than half an hour shorter than John Sturges original Yet we still had a reprise of the agonising and moralising that made even the first a little turgid at times However here there was no decent acting action or location work to balance things up Filmiing was less expansive It failed to convey the broad sweep of landscapes that were a great part of the originalbr br Generally it just lacked imagination The first movie had been a smashhit and this pedestrian sequel was evidently put together as quickly and cheaply as possible in order to cynically cashin on former success And it shows Theres very much a made for TV feel about itbr br Not recommended,negative
A long film about a very important character from South Africa Stephen Biko He is one of these Blacks who did not survive apartheid who actually died a long time before their normal time The already old film though does not show how important Biko was what he really represented His life and his teaching is reduced to little at best a few witty remarks The film being from 1987 the objective was to push South Africa over the brink that would lead her to liberation So the film aims at showing how irrational the South African supporters of apartheid are in 1987 To show this the film has to look beyond Bikos death hence to center its discourse not on Biko but on a white liberal journalist and his escaping the absurd system in which he is living His escape is made necessary because of the victimization he is the victim of along with his family and because he wants to publish the first book on Biko after his death and that can only happen in England The film shows a way to escape South Africa while apartheid is still standing and killing So do not expect this way to be realistic and true It could not be But the film has tremendously aged because it does not show South Africa with any historical distantiation the very distantiation that has taken place under Nelson Mandelas presidency and that is called forgiveness provided those who want to be forgiven speak up and out The film is strong and emotional but that very historical limit makes it rather weak today especially since the film does not mention the third racial community the Indians Panegyric books or films all have that defect they are looking at the person they are supposed to portrait from only one point of view That explains why the film has aged so much seems to be coming from so long ago as if nothing had changed at all A remake is necessarybr br Dr Jacques COULARDEAU University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines CEGID,positive
Sometimes things should just not be made And while the setup seemed good enough it proceeds to only make the audience gasp in horror But the problem is its not another Saw film Its just so bad you wish you were receiving punishment from Jason Voorheesbr br I lost track of how many sports movies and spoofs it incorporated into the film And generally it flopped in its attempts True telling his team they should fail every subject to be true players was somewhat funny at first but that grew tiring to watch That and the joke about Radio and IPodbr br Overall I cant stand to watch this film again Even Trantasia is worth more than this D,negative
I have witnessed some atrocities of cinema In the past couple of years it seems producers and directors are bent on making films that drive me closer and closer to insanity Hannibal was not an exception I wasnt expecting much when I went in to see the movie The book was ridiculous and the saying The Book is always better than the movie did not assure me at all that this movie would be anything but trash But what I came to see was a movie that made all other bad movies seem better in comparisonbr br  Usually when I see a terrible movie I find myself more amused than anything else Sadly though I could not even laugh at the sad excuse for a film that Hannibal is The movie was filmed with promise I guess It had Anthony Hopkins Julianne Moore and Gary Oldman And for directing there was Ridley Scott There have been movies with significantly less talent that have been tremendously better There was so much I would have cut from this film that I doubt anything would have remained It was pathetic The storyline was so ludicrous that it seemed like a complete idiot had written it Whats worse is that the book was even crazier and there were some scenes that were too extreme to be included which is sad in the case of a movie wherebr br SPOILER AHEAD br br Ray Liottas brain was being cooked in pieces That scene more than any other made me want to cry because it tarnished its predecessor to such a monumental level Silence of the Lambs was one of my favorite films of all time But Hannibal was a two hour plus joke This movie should only be watched if people want to learn how not to write a good movie,negative
This documentary focuses on the happenings in Gothenburg 2001 In swedish media the demonstrators where pictured as criminals that stood for anarchy and violence This movie shows that there not actually they are intelligent articulate people that has something to say  And says it by the force of bricks They believe in a better world a world where people can think and say what they want  without being aimed at But are their beliefs of having the possibility of changing the society realistic I think notbr br This documentary gives us enlightenment in the issues of greed capitalism and the future it might bring It is a great documentary that is not propaganda because it is not shown as what they say is right Everything it shows is what some individuals think and it is up to the viewer to decide if what they do and stand for is right or wrongbr br I have heard many people that labels this a propaganda and therefor chooses not to view it I think they are making a bad decision because even if you sympathize with the police or the demonstrators belief all you get is more facts to rely on for example the kid that got shoot says that he thinks that it is good to throw a brick through a McDonalds window because it is the step between thinking and acting as you thinkbr br Overall this movie freaked me out because you cannot really dismiss the facts that the few policemen that fought violence with violence did not get convicted or even detained in custody even however the proof of them throwing bricks at the demonstration march and in some cases beating people with truncheon even though they are lying on the street without making resistance where as good as it getsbr br Rating 810  Very good but not best,positive
As romantic comedies go this was a cute and winning one I thought that the writing could have been stronger to build up the final connection a bit better but that is not a huge tripping point But Amanda Detmer and Scott Wolf give nice performances and are as charming as ever These are two of my favorite actors and I was just glad to see them cast as romantic leads I hope to see them cast in more projects soonbr br Overall this movie wont change your life but is is sweet warm and winning Not a bad thing to be at all,positive
The Columbia Pictures Short Subject unit never had any delusions about producing any Art Films They wanted to give the film exhibitors just a little more for their money when booking a Columbia Picture into their theatres This would go double for The 3 Stooges filmsbr br MEN IN BLACK 1934 came about as close as any of their Comedy Shorts in that it received an Oscar nomination for Best Short Subject Comedy Though it did not win it well could have It was good enough and even those who do not number themselves among Stoogefiles still seem to be won over by the clarion cry of calling Dr Howard Dr Fine Dr Howard This was the second entry in the long series of Comedy Shorts made by the Stooges for Producer Jules White head of Columbias Short Subjects Department Only WOMAN HATERS described in its credits as a Musical Novelty preceded it at Harry Cohens Poverty Row sweatshopbr br The film starts off in the office of Dr Graves the Head of the Hospital He is receiving new interns and in addressing the group he relates that three of them are passed along from Medical Conditionally as they had remained there so long But the good Doctor states that he will not reveal their identities as long as they pledge their all for Duty and Humanity The Stooges run up front pledging for Duty and Humanity and run out of office breaking window glass in door The game was onbr br The Stooges took off and did not stop for the remainder of the 2 Reels Every type of gag was in evidence From broad Sennettlike sight gags to puns to dialect humor to theatre of the absurd and a surrealistic running gag involving a Public Address System which seemingly takes on a life of its own and having the true culprit a radio tube get shot to a he got me It all plays out quite well honest The sets used were very authentic looking and were no doubt borrowed from Columbia features being made around the same time There are plenty of Wheel Chairs Surgical Cotts Stethascopes Surcical Scalpels etc in evidence to maintain the illusion of a Hospitalbr br A true strength of MEN IN BLACK is the high number of usually nameless players whom we all recognize by face Along with them the film boasts of a great number of veteran comedy actors who always turn in fine performances often stealing the scene The people with names like Billy Gilbert Hank Mann and Bud Jamison shine in even small partsbr br And lastly we have the Maestro the ConductorDirector Raymond McCarey kid brother to Leo McCarey who showed off his abilities in getting this little film in the can He skillfully kept it all moving acting as a Traffic Cop at times what with all the actors extras and behind the scenes crew moving and outside of each others way And that doesnt count the Giant 3 Man Tandem Bicycle The Sway Backed Horse and Miniature Race Cars not to mention the Giant Green Canaries,positive
First off I must stress how rare it is that I take the time to comment on a movie that I have seen it takes a very special case for me to take the time and write about how I felt about a film That said of the hundreds of movies I have watched I have seen some of the most brilliant Shawshank the scariest The Woman in Black the funniest Shark Attack III Megaladon and now the worst Vampires vs Zombiesbr br The first thing that must be said is that this movie is not funny For those that are looking for a light hearted movie that will just be fun or at the very least so bad that its funny look elsewhere It is true that a movie such as this is not trying to be subtle and brilliant with a title such as this you should know what youre getting into That said there is no excuse for a movie to abandon any and every rule that governs the movie making world This is not an argument between the traditional movie making process and newer and more artsy methods to creating a film this is an argument between bad directors and companies being held accountable for making terrible moviesbr br This movie suffers from the over used saying I dont know where to start Truly everything about this movie is broken From the acting and to the editing there is no reason any movie should ever fail to deliver a cohesive series of events such as Vampires vs Zombies Some of the following problems are 1 Scene misfires Its clear that the director the camera crew and the actors were not on the same page In one scene in particular the scene begins with the camera resting on the ground looking at the passenger side door of a car You are expecting the person inside to get out but there is a and this is NO exaggeration 10 second at least delay between the camera comes on and the director says action to where anything happens on screen The viewer is left staring at a car door for the entire time with no sound no movement just the stereotypical dead air that radio or TV commentators dread Where was the editing 2 Acting A forgivable offense in most cases you cant expect a movie like this to have Oscar winners after all but Vampires vs Zombies takes bad acting to a whole other level These actors were barely able to read their scripts obviously because anyone with any ability to read and to speak would have been able to pronounce the lines better than these fools My only comparison for acting would have to be the opening scene from Resident Evil on Playstation But that acting was even betterbr br 3 Story Wait what Story Again you cant expect this to be The Greatest Story Ever Told but is it too much to ask that we have some semblance of a narrative Why the Vampires Who are the characters Who are the bad guys Are there good guys Why all the lesbians But most importantly whats the deal with the zombies If you have seen this movie then you will understand what I mean but to those who havent Ill be plain there are no zombies in this movie aside from maybe five minutes of it It was almost as if the director forgot about the name of the movie and was forced to throw some zombies in without explanation at the very endbr br Theres so much more but I hope Ive done enough to keep anyone from seeing this movie,negative
Possible spoilersbr br Ive read up on Dahmer a little and saw the new Dahmer film with the same name at an earlier time This movie here concentrates rather much on the victims and killings too little on Dahmer himself The film called Dahmer had the opposite problem it was too little about his crimes and too much about himselfbr br I did not find the acting to my satisfaction it had a certain amateur feel too it especially the probation officer It also seemed as if the Dahmer acting got worse every time he played against the probation officer actor But I might be wrong about thatbr br What annoyed me a bit was that some of the scenes were quite disturbing but that the filmmakers seemed to try and show the real deal about what he did anyway That is ok  but what I then dont understand is why the guy who ran away from his flat while Dahmer was out getting beer was not depicted being naked since that is also how it happened Its not a big deal but it just eats away further on the movies quality that such details are left out What wasnt shown either or not even really hinted was Dahmers sexual obsession with the dead Again I dont mind they didnt SHOW it but at least they could have mentioned it or built it in to the movie somehowbr br Conclusion I think the really good Dahmer film is still to be made a movie that incorporates not only Dahmers crimes but also who he was and why he did what he did I think that 15 or 2 hours are just not enough to grasp the complexity of it all This movie was just a cutout excuse the pun of Dahmers life and personality and does not give you any close to good insight into his life or personalitybr br 410,negative

Knute Rockne led an extraordinary life and his story is told rather well in Knute Rockne All American We follow Rocknes incredible journey from young Norwegian boy to iconic American football legend Produced in 1940 the film may at times seem a touch dated and at times downright hokey And the filmmakers do lay it on a bit thick at times as Rockne is glowingly and lovingly portrayed You may come away thinking Rockne should have been nominated for sainthood when in fact he was after all just a football coach But it is undeniable that he had a great impact on the game of football as well as having a tremendous impact on the lives of so many of the young men he coached This film shows the great impact he had and gives you an insight into why he is so revered to this daybr br Playing Rockne Pat OBrien gives an impressive performance Its unquestionably OBriens movie to carry and he makes the film and the character his own The reallife Rockne was renowned as a great inspirational figure and OBriens performance will make you understand why The only quibble comes early in the film when OBrien in his early forties is playing the college student Rockne in his early twenties All the makeup in the world wasnt going to make that believable and the effect is rather jarring But as the Rockne character ages and begins his legendary coaching career OBrien fits the part perfectlybr br As for the rest of the cast one name jumps out and that is of course Ronald Reagan playing the young charismatic but ultimately doomed football star George Gipp In the grand scheme of the film its not really a large part with Reagan appearing for no more than 1015 minutes But the performance has become legendary thanks to Reagans famous Win one for the Gipper deathbed speech Its a brilliantlyplayed scene chockfull of emotion Reagan may not have been on the screen for very long in this film but he certainly made a tremendously positive impact in a winning performancebr br The rest of the film strikes a balance between football and life in general with Rockne having great lessons for his young men in both areas For football fans and history buffs there is a rare treat as actual archival footage from Notre Dame games of the Rockne era is interspersed throughout the film Its a rare opportunity to see just how much the game has evolved in the last sixplus decades and an opportunity to see Rocknes legendary strategic innovations put into practice If youre a Notre Dame fan youll probably enjoy the fact that the Notre Dame Victory March provides a seemingly constant soundtrack for the film If youre a Notre Dame haterwell then youre probably not watching this movie anyway Knute Rockne All American is an inspiring uplifting emotional film Perhaps a tad overly sentimental but thats not such a bad thing Its a very enjoyable film one well worth taking the time to see,positive
I get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie not all people but a lot of them because they dont want to admit they dont understand it People of middling intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Lynch is a geniusbr br Lynch to me is like Tarantino Theyre both great but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe No director can change the world so chill out And both make sucky flicks sometimes it just happens Everyone has a bad day And clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hackjobbed into a feature film it wasnt made with all the passion and forethought one should put into a movie Face it much of the movie is gibbering unintelligibility which cannot be understood We can all make up meanings Lynch may have his own view but none of that matters It was strewn about the screen incoherently Admittedly the first portion had the semblance of an intentionally convoluted passingly interesting story but then it faltersbr br The cowboy the mysterious organization of men with their phonecalls the lawyers come on I can almost picture David Lynch yelling cut forcing the crew to gather around him and explaining to them all Look how crazy and weird I am Isnt it great Its so weird and crazy Weird and crazy works if its a byproduct of your style However its pretentious and tired when you go out of your way to do nothing but that Its like all those half assed Pulp Fiction throw backs that came out after Pulp Fiction Its just not cool,negative
I remember I saw this cartoon when I was 6 or 7 My grandfather picked up the video of it for free at the mall I remember that it really sucked The plot had no sense I hated the fox that became Caspers friend He was so stupid Casper cried his head off if he couldnt find a friend So what Get over it The only good part and I dont want to sound meanspirited was when the fox got shot and died at the end I laughed my head off in payback because this cartoon sucked so much The bad news is the fox resurrects and becomes a ghost I wish he had stayed dead I think I even gave the video of this to somebody because I hated it No wonder they were offering it for free at the mall If you have a child dont let them watch this They will probably agree with me that it sucks,negative

This movie is a gem It is the story of Juliette a perfectly ordinary cleaning woman who works in the large corporate office of a yogurt company and Romuald the president of same He takes no notice of her he takes no notice of anyone until several plots to wrest his company away from him all hit at the same time He is lost no one to turn to and no one to trust when he discovers Juliette As the cleaning woman no one pays any attention to her so they say and do incriminating things in front of her that she is smart enough to catch on to and use to help her helpless and hapless bossbr br I have been keeping an eye out for years for the DVD of this and to see a previous comment about it being released in Sep 2007 raised my hopes Alas I cannot find a DVD does anyone know if there iswas one,positive
Ive seen Jimmy Stewart in all the regular roles but the Spirit of St Louis was reported to be one of his favorites A poor boxoffice performer when released this film has been largely forgotten today Telling the wellknown story of Lindbergs famous flight in 1927 Stewart seems to be badly misscast at first and his well known voice never lets you forget who youre watching it feels like George Baily all over again But Stewart obviously worked hard on the role and he does everything right so before long you dont care anymore that Stewart was 20 years older than the man hes portraying Stewarts Lindberg is so goshdarn allAmerican applepie likable that you get caught up in the story and you realize that Stewart intended to portray Lindberg with all of the awshucks Yankeeknowhow he could muster up Lindberg was an almost mythical hero in the US and Stewart seems determined to keep up appearancesbr br Flash backs are cleverly used to keep what is really a rather dull story moving along and I was struck by the subtle references to Faith that were scattered through the film Lindberg trying to teach a hopeless priest how to fly only to be confronted by the priest on his beliefs or Lindberg refusing to carry a proffered St Christopher medal to save weight on the plane only to find the medal hidden in his lunch bag after hed crossed the Atlantic For me this is a film not about a mans epic journey into the unknown but his realization that this life is much bigger than the things we can see and feel,positive

When it came out this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment To this day its more entertaining than most in great part because it has James Cagney in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty girl Friday played by Joan Blondell Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Busby Berkeley are pretty much a knockout as far as that type of thing goesbr br But this is a pretty strange movie I mean in one of those numbers youve got Billy Barty running around pretending to be a lovable toddler doing all kinds of weird stuff Ruby Keeler seems to have a sickening smile plastered on her face at all times but at least shes not required to act like in some of her later unfortunate films Youd never guess that Dick Powell was any kind of tough guy from seeing him in this movie apparently all the tough guy energy was allocated to the star Cagney As for Cagney his high speed rants about musical shows and so forth are endearing and annoying at the same time After a while it gets a bit too much You expect him to walk out and say Hey Ive got a great idea for a prologue The women are cigarettes and they come out of a pack of smokes Oh no we did that one last month Its funny but it gets a bit repetitive In the moments where he has to get tough with the bad girl Ruth Donnelly some of the established Cagney gangster character comes out In fact frequent B gangster director William Keighley is credited here with dialogue coaching and it seems at times that Cagney and Blondell are invoking something very street even though the characters arent criminalbr br The musical numbers what can you say They stand alone as entertainment the way that Berkeley uses the human body and geometry is really startling But none of them really mean anything It means Honeymoon Hotel nothing really more or less And the whole pretense of the integration falls apart immediately since the characters in the show are doing things that couldnt possibly be appreciated by a theater audience like the movie portrays For example at one point they show the fine print on a newspaper things like that The whole thing could only exist on film so the idea that the prologues are actually live shows is ridiculous I can only suppose that audiences of the time were somewhat less critical about things like this than they would be ten years later or so because this is a very polished productionbr br Its great to see Cagney himself show off his superb dancing skills and he can actually share the stage with a dancer like Keeler Cagney and Blondell have excellent chemistry and their scenes go off really well The music I would say is only mediocre but mostly pleasing if repetitive Bacons direction in general is very suitable but never interesting The films entertainment value is unquestionable and it has also picked up some nostalgic value along the way Its a cut above most lets put on a show films of the 30s,positive
This film is one of the best shorts Ive ever seen  and as I make it a point to be at all the major film festivals Ive seen a lot especially of what the industry considers the best Im not a fan of Monaghan His acting generally tends to be overdone and uninteresting to me his only decent performance being in Lost so I generally try to avoid his films I did however happen to see this at a film festival a few years back and was completely awed This director really knows what shes doing Of course you are going to get the trolls or just ignorant people who dont understand what constitutes a good film and rip on low budget work because they have no idea what went into it But luckily from what Ive seen they are in the minority when it comes to this gembr br Lets not deny that the film was working on no budget and that a couple of the supporting actors could still use work because thats certainly true The production value is very low but what can you expect for a first real film from someone still in high school Pretend for a moment that the budget doesnt matter If you take away a bit of the acting the sound quality which actually wasnt the fault of the filmmaker I saw this at a festival and the sound was fineI guarantee whoever made the DVD itself screwed up and the fact it was shot on miniDV then what are you left with The story the visual composition and the soul of the film which are indisputably flawlessbr br Nanavati can tell a story That much is clear She can write substanceheavy engaging scripts better than most people in Hollywood create a shot list that perfectly compliments that story and bring it to life in a fascinating creative way that were this higher budget might have won awards Give it more experienced actors better sound postproduction and 35mm instead of miniDV and even the trolls couldnt complain This girl is incredible and keeping in mind that Insomniac was made a good few years ago shes done some amazing work since The trailer for Dreams of an Angel shows that and I cant wait to see the higher budget stuff shes done 910 stars this is one hell of a movie from one hell of a filmmaker,positive
Perhaps one of the best movies ever made Orry and Goerges friendship runs deep and the War puts a strain on their strong friendship As a Southerner I can honestly say this epic is as accurate as it gets Brothers fighting brothers Can you imagine what life must have been living during those times The best part of the movie for me was when The South surrenders General Grant is urging President Lincoln to really stick it to the South he says Mr President a lot of folks want The South to bleed over what theyve done President Lincoln turns to him and in a very tired voice says The South has bled enoughand so have we I burst into tears and take a deep breath What a President Its like a father saying his son has been punished enough and despite his anger he realizes his point has been made This War was a very dark time for our young country and it had to be fought President Lincoln knew this Im urging everyone who reads this to watch this movie and add it to your DVD collection Then thank God that our country was preserved As Jesus said a House divided against itself cannot stand,positive

This film has a special place in my heart as when I caught it the first time I was teaching adult literacy It rang very true to me and even an outstanding student I had at the time There are scenes which make you gulp with sudden emotion and those which even put a smile on your face through sheer identification with the characters and their situation br br Excellent performances by Jane Fonda and Robert DeNiro that rank with their best work a great turn by a young Martha Plimpton an inspiring story line and a haunting musical score makes for a most enjoyable and rewarding experience,positive

You know after the first few Chuck Norris movies I got so I could tell that a movie was produced by GolanGlobus even if I tuned in in the middle without ever looking at the credits or the title Whats more I could tell it was GolanGlobus within a minute of screen time Something about the story structure the goofy relationships between the characters the mannered dialog the wooden acting spiked with the occasional outright terrible performance the scene tempos and rhythms that made Albert Pyun look like John McTiernan the paperthin plots and notreadyforprimetime fight choreographyGolanGlobus has been incredibly consistent over the years in style subject matter and pointofviewbr br What can you say it must work for them since theyve produced literally dozens of movies You go to one of their productions and you know exactly what youre getting And it aint brain food folksbr br Ninja 3 is another piece of hackwork in a long line of products from the GG sausage factory and offers the typical limited pleasures to the moviegoers palate Youve got a Bad Ninja slicing up cops and criminals and anyone else who gets in their way Youve got a Good Ninja pledged to stop him Youve got a Westerner thrown into the mix so we Americans can identify with him or her in this case and be reassured that We can still beat those pesky Orientals at their own game Youve got a Love Interest who is usually also the worst actorress in the film fencing with the Hero Youve got your endless string of assaults assassinations and lingering shots of men gurgling in agony while an arrow or throwing star sticks unconvincingly out of their eye neck or chest Youve got your Beefy White GuyBodyguards in Suits calling a Ninja a Son of A Btch and throwing a roundhouse punch only to get his ss handed to him Youve got a Final Confrontation between the Good Guy and The Bad Guy which goes on for 20 minutes and just sort of stops like a RoadRunner cartoon instead of reaching a climax or a resolutionbr br Ninja 3 is a little different in that the plot revolves around a scrappy female athletic type getting possessed by the Bad Ninja so she ends up killing a lot of the cops and criminals and Beefy White Bodyguards in Suits while under his spell But all the other elements are there as formal in their way as a Kabuki play or a Noh dramabr br I actually thought Lucinda Dickey was pretty likable in this film Shes nicely muscled and curvy has great cheekbones and some athletic ooomph to her movements and you can actually suspend belief enough to accept that her character could do some of the feats she pulls off in the movie She can almost but not quite carry this thing One extra start for her participation and good energybr br Naturally Sho Kusugi is in here and he pretty much dominates the last 1015 minutes of the movie And just to show you how 3rdrate and uninspired GG movies are the director and editor intercut the last climactic fight between Kosugi and the Bad Ninja scene with numerous reaction shots of Dickey and her boyfriend watching the life and death battle with an expression of mild bemusement Im seriousfor all the emotion and reaction they show to the proceedings they could be looking at a sea turtle in an aquarium at Marineland I can only imagine how Dickey must have felt when she saw the finished product  she probably wanted to run the editor through with a katana for real because those reaction shots make her look like a complete idiot br br An enjoyable waste of timebut it definitely IS a waste of time Maybe if you are a Sho Kusugi fan or even a Linda Dickey fan youd find it worth your while,negative

This was a romantic simple funny movie I really enjoyed it and would definitely say to watch it and enjoy it Will Smith was funny fumbly nervous sweet and just a simple guy who got hit by Love It was cute to see him fall for someone and be so nervous and lost as to what to do or say It was great He was great funny as usual Eva Mendes was better than i expected her to be as well i thought there were moments in the movie where Will got the shaft he was doing everything he could being a good guy and still getting treated bad The ending was romantic and happy and it was great I have seen it several times and would watch it again A funny movie something you dont see a lot of anymore It had the old time feel with a fresh new look,positive
After the success of ScoobyDoo Where are You they decided to give Scooby and Shaggy their own show But unfortunately they added a new character that spoilt ScoobyDoo success forever They invented a new show with a new title Scooby and ScrappyDoo It was ScrappyDoo that made this show a complete failure probably for both adults and kids together Scrappy was the stupid brave puppy that always looked ready to beat someone up Scooby and Shaggy were getting scared of the villain and they were also trying to stop him ScoobyDoo doesnt need any little annoying bastard puppy nephews If they wanted ScoobyDoo to be more successful they should have either killed or never thought up Scrappy This was just poor maybe your kids will prefer it,negative

No wonder a lot of us hate classical music and what are the children to think With educational PR like this serious music will soon slip from life support to the morgue Kids know when theyre being talked down to and this is no exception why cant someone good do a movie about classical music for kids I must admit I enjoyed the actor who played Beethoven he took to the role with enthusiasm and a keen balance of the poignant and humorous aspects of Beethovens character he obviously did his research Otherwise this is a third rate rehash of the old ABC Afterschool Special format with none of the occasional charm those short films had Sorry about the rant but this is an important subject for young people to know about and it could have been done well I wonder if musicians or filmmakers were responsible Either way the kids are hipper than you think folksbr br Medtner,negative
A lot of people seemed to have liked the film so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review But after sitting through 96 minutes of it I feel I have to do so Where the heck is the plot in this film I must have missed it I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened Sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didnt build up to it I forgot who was who half of the time so they didnt really develop the characters The acting was soso most of the time it was believable but I was able to see through it most of the time So without giving anything away I must say that unless you like the actors in the film there is no real reason to watch this movie I could be mistaken but I just didnt understand why there was so little or too much of the film I cant decide which one that would be so I say judge for yourselves I dont even know if renting it would be a good idea the cost and all br br Plot 010 Characters 110 Acting 210 Overall 310 I feel like thats too high really I am staying with my vote up at the top,negative

Bangville Police supposedly marked the debut of the Keystone Kops named after the studio they worked for In this one however they dont dress in the silly cop costumes or drive the fastpaced car thats their trademark Anyway Mabel Normand is a farm girl here whos begged her dad for a calf She later sees some strange men in the barn and quickly calls the police One answers and the chase is on Next Mabel slams her door just as someone is coming in Turns out its her mother who jumps to the conclusion robbers are in there So while Mabel blocks her door with furniture the mother and father try to fight their way in This was perhaps the most amusing part of the short along with some explosions of the cop car This was a short 7 minutes that went by so fast its over before its begun The only real characterization thats developed is Mabels who exudes charm with just her face and big eyes and seems so optimistically cheery here except of course when shes frightened Its easy to see why she became a star Its largely because of her that Id recommended seeing this at least once and why Im giving this a 4,negative
A friend clearly with no taste or class suggested I take a look at the work of Ron Atkins If this is representative of his oeuvre I never want to see anything else by him It is amateurish selfindulgent criminally shoddy and selfindulgent rubbish The whore mangler of the title is an angry low budget filmmaker who murders a bunch of hookers There is a little nudity and some erections but no single element could possibly save this from the hangmans noose The lighting is appalling the dialog is puerile and mostly shouted and the direction is clueless I saw a doco on American exploitation filmmakers during the recent Fangoria convention Atkins was one of those featured He spoke like there was something important about his work but after a viewing of this I see nothing of any import whatsoever There is no style either and the horrible video effects like solarization only enhance the amateurishness Not even so bad its fun Avoid,negative
Quentin in my opinion has written and directed only really one good movie and that was the multiple award winning Pulp Fiction However most of films especially of recent have been real REAL turkeys People still rate him and his stuff today and i really cant see why There are many other directors and writers nowadays producing far better entertainment in all aspects of their movies From this point on i shall not believe the hype that is a Tarantino moviebr br Inglorious was too long and worse still you felt it The humor was well minimal and not that humorous The violence was nothing new minus the end scene The dialog was sometimes very VERY drawn outbr br For some theyll love this movie and for others theyll hate itbr br  and i thought the subject matter of Nazis was finally put to bed with the awesome 2004 German movie Der Untergang,negative

A story of obsessive love pushed to its limits and of a lovely swan whose beauty is the very ticket to her own premature demise Placed at the beginning of talkies PRIX DE BEAUTE walks a thin line in being a fullon silent film  which is still is at heart  and flirting with sound and sound effects The effect is a little irritating for anyone coming into this film because the recorded audio is extremely tinny and just doesnt help it at all Hearing sound stage conversation edited over the beginning sequence which takes place in a beach for example is as part of the movie as the actress who dubs Louise Brooks dialog and in doing so robs the audience of a fine performance Other than that the movie rolls along more or less well with little jumps in continuity here and there  something quite common in films from this era  and has that vague sped up feel typical of silents In a way this is an experiment of a movie and closer to the style of Sergei Eisenstein in visual presentation and nearintimate closeups that elevate it from what would be a more pedestrian level Louise Brooks here plays a character less flapper than what she was known for shes a stenographer who on a lark decides to enter a beauty contest despite the furious opposition of her extremely smothering boyfriend Her role is quite Thirties and contemporary for its time the last of the flapperJazz Baby roles were being shown on screen and now with the onset of female independence women as professionals were being represented in film That Brookss character decides to leave her boyfriend even if she does reconcile with him later is also a little ahead of her time However her characters fatal flaw is its willing to believe what isnt there  that her boyfriend wants her to succeed  and this is what leads to her end at the movie theatre This final sequence looks like something straight out of Hitchcock in its heightened suspense seen in THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH and cuts from Brooks her image on screen and the murderous boyfriend Even more dramatic is the placement of the still singing live Brooks with the now dead one  a chilling effect to a chilling powerful movie,positive

This film is a perfect example of the recent crop of horror films that simply are not fully realized There are two routes to take in horror films either you dont really explain whats going on or who the killer is like in Texas Chainsaw Massacre or give the characters a lot of back story and characterization so that everything is explained Halloween could potentially be an example of thisbr br Unfortunately Creep fails in this area I see absolutely no reason to give a small shred of the back story for Craig without fully capturing the essence of his character or his motivation No character is fully realized although the circular nature of Kates character in the film is the most accomplished part of the storybr br In the end this story is mostly unmotivated and none of the performances give it the necessary life to make it enthralling or interesting enough to overcome the lack of context and empty filmmaking that drag down the filmbr br This film will go down as another example of a film as most are that could be so much better even though it would never be great The only thing that was used properly in the film was the setting the characters story direction and overall writing would have benefited from a serious face liftbr br Creep does serve a purpose as a mindless silly horror movie with no intellectual or emotional investment but sadly thats about it,negative

Perhaps the most polished and accomplished of all Indian films  Pakeezah does not fall into any of the traps commonly associated with Bollywood film ie tackiness farce wholesale and unsuccessful imitation of western film themesgenres Pakeezah is indigenous to the SubContinent and authentic almost Madam Butterflylike in plot Characters are welldeveloped direction although sometimes unrefined by todays standards perceptive and convincing The Urduspeaking milieux at the time of Pakeezah were masters of understatement and how the dialogue conveys the subtleties of the age The acting particularly the looks and the dynamic between characters are a delight to behold although the nuances may be lost on contemporary viewers or those not acquainted with the mores and customs of Muslim Indiabr br Coupled with a captivating screenplay is a beautiful musical score enhanced by the protagonist displaying eminent command of classical Indian dance kathak As is the case with most romantic tragedies the heroine must die but she does not take her leave of the audience without the viewer feeling heshe has been party to a truly memorable cinema experience Pakeezah is surely the pinnacle of what Indian cinema has produced and is unlikely to be paralleled,positive
This movie was Jerry Bruckheimers idea to sell some records  No seriously it was  The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP  sell it and make even more money for the studio  You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when MTV play a track youre actually getting free advertising for the movie  This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American film making and FLASHDANCE opened the door to this  Lets make a 90 minute pop video instead of a movie  type film makingbr br Jennifer Beals plays Alex Owens a dancer who works as a welder to make ends meet and right away logic disappears with this career choice  Welding is a fairly sophisticated trade  its not something you walk into and learn in five minutes  Theres other gaps in logic like ballet dancing and  flashdancing  being somehow similar  ie if you apply to be a ballet dancer and do some hot  dirty flashdancing the male judges might want to meet you after the audition but you wont get the job  its kind of like saying that screen writing  novel writing and play writing are somehow the same when theyre not br br But I guess none of this mattered to Jerry when he asked director Adrian Lyne to make the movie  Actually Lyne almost makes a very sexy movie  JenniferBeals is very sweet and innocent looking  Fortunately I sussed out why her face is brightly lit in close up while her silhouette is darkly litin long shots except when the camera cuts to close ups of her heavenly toned body  Thats because a body double is used most of the time and frequently the body double is a man  I bet theres a few naughty boys who are feeling guilty not to mention slightly disgusted to know that,negative

Anyone who finds this film boring is a hopeless bonehead who should stick to car chase movies and romantic comedies This film is riveting and doesnt have a boring moment Why Because it is comprised largely of intelligent dialogue between real people in a moment of crisis and details their efforts to survive that crisis I repeatintelligent dialogue That is what characterizes nearly all of Rohmers films and that is why a lot of people dont like them They prefer action Fine let them spend the rest of their lives watching action films while those of us with taste and discrimination will continue to seek out films like thisbr br Rohmer has always been accused of being talky Well he is but to me thats a compliment not a criticism Shakespeare was talky too Is there a talkier play than Hamlet Whenever the subject or theme of a work of art consists of ideas and conflicts over values there must of necessity be a discussion of these ideas and values an that is largely what this film is all about Aristocracy and noble birth vs egalitarianism loyalty to old friends that is put to the ultimate test when that friend takes what we believe to be a wrong path the value of human life and the responsibility to help save that life even if the person possessing that life is not so nice or even despicable Anyone ever hear of Dostoyevsky or Crime and Punishment These are what this film is all aboutbr br The two leads in this film are impeccable as if they were born to play these roles Lucy Russell who is English and speaks French as her second language is especially brilliant Do yourself a favor and see this riveting film It may be the last film by this screen Master,positive
Ive read every book to date in the left behind series and the movie hardly does any of them justice Sure Ive seen worse movies but this was incredibly disappointing This movie would have made a good MST3K episode The script was a horrible adaptation of the book and it felt like the actors were reading their lines instead of actually saying them The characters were stiff and unlikeable The effects were cheesy and looked terribly fake The ending was awful First of all it didnt even go all the way through the first book Second it made no sense If you hadnt read the book youd have no idea what was going on It had to have been the most cheesy film studentlike ending Ive ever seen in a movie Im upset that I actually paid money for this movie If by some miracle it does get wide release they ought to totally overhaul it and let Hollywood take over Those two wannabe film producers and the wannabe director should leave movie making to the professionals,negative

This was a riveting film one that really drew me in Im a big fan of William H Macy and he puts in a wonderful performance His great likeability coupled with the way his character breaks the fourth wall really gave me a sense of complicity in his actions I found myself waiting tensely for the whole house of cards to come collapsing down around him and by extension myself as his confidante and silent witness It took several minutes for me to relax once the film had ended I was so wrapped up in it br br Good performances all around too not just with Macy Arkin was quite good as was Cromwell he was surprisingly fierce In short I highly recommend this film to any fans of Macy andor the murder mystery But you may want to prepare to feel a little guilty,positive
Richard Brooks excellent 1967 film of Truman Capotes novel IN COLD BLOOD is a perfect companion piece to Philip Seymour Hoffmans Oscar winning performance in the 2005 CAPOTE They really play well together try them on separate nights It is unusual to find films made 38 years apart that mesh so well These two truly enhance each other Even though different actors play the roles of killers Perry Smith and Dick Hickock the two pieces blend well Only the part of the writer played by Paul Stewart in the Brooks films is weaker as they give him a different name then Capote Id suggest watching CAPOTE first followed by IN COLD BLOOD It makes for a powerful experience,positive
At first three words READ THE BOOK Really guys  this demonstrates the difficulties of genuine rendition of esoteric matters I loved the book and was utterly disappointed of the film It was ludicrous with half a heart and the story bad explained The novel  in the first place  wasnt meant to focus on an adventure Thats only the surroundings In the film the focus reverses to just that and the message has taken a back seat Additional the visual effects to show the energy of all living things and the elucidation of the events at the end were parsimonious They screwed it up  Ill never watch it again,negative
This film is probably the best new French film Ive seen in this century so far There have been some great ones including Noes Irreversible Greens Le Pont des Arts and Hadzihalilovics Innocencebut none of them come close to Les Amants Reguliers timeless glorybr br The movie is a description of the events of May 68 and what followed in the wake of it and furthermore it is and update of and a homage to the Nouvelle Vaguemovies of those days Concerning the depiction of the riots in Paris the movie is meticulously accurate Im only 19 and I wasnt there myself but you know what I meanand the almost realtime and very long riot scenes set the stage perfectly for the aftermath of the events in the streets of Paris The riots are not glorified or beautifully photographed like the ones in Bertoluccis The Dreamers to which the movie is comparable in many ways instead they are filmed in grimy black and white shots courtesy of the excellent William Lubtchansky The love story that is the movies main concern after the riots in 68 is filmed in stunning and far less blurred shots and manages to evoke true feelings of love and adolescent confusion in the midst of the otherwise politically concerned and seemingly cold environmentbr br This film is a beautiful love story and it radiates through it that the director wants to depict his own experiences of those mythical late 60s which makes the film all the more compelling But the film is also a homage to the whole Nouvelle Vague canon Much of the dialogue evokes early Truffaut and the length and nonaction and plot less structure is reminiscent of Eustache or Rivette There are even Godardlike verfremdungeffects with the persons looking directly into the camera and even addressing Bernardo Bertolucci directly This film is no doubt an answer song to Bertoluccis The Dreamers and it is also a Nouvelle Vague homage but still it stands by itself as a beautiful and radiant love storybr br Bottom line This movie is incredible and if you love French cinema you shouldnt sleep on it It may be the finest french film since Eustaches La Mamain et la Putain,positive

As the film opens two thugs kill another thug When the body is discovered and about to be autopsied the doctor realizes that although the man was shot dead he was also suffering from the Pneumonic plaguea very nasty and more virulent version of the Bubonic plague So its a race against time to find those who came in contact with the dead man and treat them immediately otherwise a disaster could eruptbr br Oddly I actually know quite a bit about the Pneumonic plague as I taught a series of lectures on it for my history classes The film really did not do a good job of getting the facts right about the disease in that it looked little like what the people had in the movie The biggest problem is that this illness is so incredibly grotesque that in 1950 they really wouldnt have been allowed to show it Sure there is high fever and coughing they got this right but also lots of bleeding and explosive vomiting of blackened bloodalong with the enormously swollen lymph nodes like youd get with the Bubonic plagueall purply and gross I can certainly understand why they didnt go this far Also I am sure that the federal government would have had a much much greater involvement in controlling and treating the diseasehere in the film it was handled on a very local level and everyone seemed illprepared and a bit dumb No one seemed willing to believe the doctors As for the acting the film had some excellent actors here Richard Widmark and Paul Douglas are respectively the public health doctor and police chief Good actors but also known actors back in 1950 However in his first film is the very menacing Jack Palance still going by his original moniker Walter Jack Palance as well as the relatively unknown at the time Zero Mostel Palance was greatvery scary and very physically adept in his own stunts Mostel played a heavy typical of his early worka greasy and cowardly sort of evilbr br Overall despite really not getting the details right and wrapping everything up a little too neatly the film is very tense and has excellent actingand is well worth seeing,positive

I loved this movie I totally disagree with some negative critiques that Ive read over the years This was a great vehicle for Eddie Murphy He appeared to have a great time with his part as Chandler Jarrell and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it  and most of his audience enjoyed it And it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr Murphys great comedic style You have to keep in mind that Golden Child is a fantasy film  just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the real world During the time this film was released I was working in a video rental store This was one of the most popular with all our customers Every single time we put this one up on our monitor ALL the copies we had went out fast with waitlist requests that kept it on the queue for months Everyone who rented it loved it I was the resident film critic and all my regular customers would ask my opinion before they rented  this was one of my favorites and I knew the taste of my customers so I highly recommended this one to most of them I really feel that this film is a Sleeper  it may not have done too well at the box office  due to very poor marketing  but it hit a high in the video rental and purchase market later YES I did buy this film for my own video library I adored the little boy who played the Golden Child  J L Reate  but after looking at his profile in IMDb I noticed that he never did any more films That is sad because he definitely had an onscreen aura and could have continued with a film career I also adored Victor Wong who played the Old Man I LOVED him in his part as Egg Shen in Big Trouble in Little China  1986 At any rate this was a great film The only drawbacks that didnt seem to fit with the theme were some of the parts that got a bit more adult in nature  such as Chandlers rather sexual remarks about the serpent lady that was presented to him as a silhouette It was funny but it still was out of sync OK so there were a few suggestive gratuitous scenes  those were put in for the mindset of the day perhaps This was still an adventurous and escapist type of film which we do need today to get away from all the hard core reality and depressing fluff that we are hit with from Hollywood Now thats Entertainment,positive

This could have been a good episode but I simply had to turn it off The British representation was horrible to watch Have the makers ever set foot in Britain prior to filming At least set foot in England I dont think any British person have had such an accent apart from a comedy skit of The Royal Family Also with the 2 English boys well I dont think any English boy has acted spoke or dressed like any English kid in the history of the British nation since Prince William and Harrys preteen public appearances To American film makers There is more than 1 country in the UK England Wales Scotland and Northern Ireland meaning more than 1 culture I can handle some stereotyping but this was so bad I could not watch it Fire looked cool though,negative
I am not one of those people that will walk out of a movie that was based on source material and automatically say The book was better I know better than to demote the value of a movie just because it wasnt a faithful adaptation There is a lengthy process and lots of decisions that go into making a movie that are sometimes out of the directorseditorscinematographersproducers control and certainly out of the original authors control Therefore it is unreasonable to expect a movie to be exactly the same word for word as a book or play or video game or Disneyland Ride or whatever A movie should be judged on its own standard and how it fits in society Moreover a successful movie should be made because the material is relevant to the society which it belongs and if it is based on source material its relevance needs to be reexamined and enhanced by the filmmakers br br Films like There Will Be Blood follow this paradigm because while it was based on a novel written at the turn of the century Oil it feels relevant because of things like the Iraq war and energy concerns that the films country of origin the US was and is experiencing Even King Kong based on the original film benefits from using new technology and concerns of animal rights that people havebr br With that said I just dont understand why they even bothered to make this movie Besides the great performances guaranteed Oscar nods and Shanleys directorwriters fee and royalties he will get this movie seems to come from nowhere It should have simply stayed as a play The movie which is essentially the same as the play says nothing new about the reprehensible sexual atrocities committed and in many cases covered up by the Catholic church here and abroad It says nothing new or different than the original play I cant help but compare this movie to another movie that came out at around the same time FrostNixon which was also based on a play FrostNixon while about Nixons regrets seems relevant because it seems to have come at a time when President Bush was about to leave office The regrets that Nixon had as depicted in the playmovie about the war and his presidency could just as easily reflected on Bush and his presidency In that respect FrostNixon seemed more relevant and actually benefited from a wider distribution via film because it got people talking and reflecting about the political status quo in the country at the time In contrast Doubt felt like it was yesterdays news and didnt seem to offer anything that the play didnt offerbr br Of course the movie is good the performances are outstanding and the screenplay adaptation is apt but so what Why didnt it just stay as a play Why besides marketing and financial reasons make it into a movie It gave audiences nothing new to discus about the awful subject,negative
Meh Sums it all up for me really Boring story bland dialogue dull action scenes HOW do you make something like a fight or a shootout boring Do you actually have to TRY to do that no real characters etc Just dull Snipes is a gifted actor and physical performer but none of this has come to the surface in ANY of his DTV work when the opportunity is there to give the audience a much more superior product than they are used to Imagine a decent script with a few solid characters that you care about and some damn explosive action fights shootouts etc How can it be that hard to handle My personal opinion is that the primary players in the productions simply do not care There is no evidence of enthusiasm for what they are doing Look at Snipes in the first 2 Blades Passenger 57 Rising Sun New Jack City Demolition Man etc Awesome intense performances complemented by decent if not always outstanding scripts good supporting casts and wicked actionbr br None of that is evident in any of these releases so far which is a tremendous shame The distributors slap Wesleys face on the cover knowing the audience will lap them up as they havent realised yet that they havent seen him in theatres for nearly 2 yearsbr br Id love to see Snipes work with somebody like Isaac Florentine who really knows how to make the most out of a DTV production and work with Alpha Stunts who are simply some of the best action guys out there Together they would all make an awesome team and a Snipes action vehicle we would all be proud of seeingbr br Detonator sucks Its not as bad as The Marksman which chews but it still really sucks,negative

This movie is in the same league as Ishtar Lots of wasted talent Who let this bomb escape When Sigfried says an example has to be made in reference to a nuclear bomb I said Please let it be this theatre Dont waste your time Not even worth a free rental And where did they get these shills to fill the comments section on IMDb I cant believe that anyone who has ever seen the original series enjoyed this stinker Steve Carell is not a physical comedian If they removed the comedy and made it a straight action movie it could pass What the heck was the purpose of the dance scene Also the fat jokes and references were tasteless This movie never missed a chance to go for the lowest common denominator and scenes just ended it seemed as if no one thought them through Just awful Save your time if not money and give this movie a pass,negative
I truly enjoyed this film The acting was terrific as was the plot Jeff Combs has more talent than he is recognized for The only part of this flick I would change was the ending The death of the creature was far too gruesome for the Sci Fi Channelbr br There were some interesting religious messages in this film Jeff Combs obviously played a Messiah figure and the creature or shark if you prefer represented the antiChirst There were some particularly frightening scenes that had that end of the world feel I only noticed this after my third viewing of this classic creature feature I know many people wont get the references to Christianity but if you watch close youll get it,positive

A female country singer nicknamed Big Tseriously thats what they call herrisks her budding musical career and her life by falling into the company of a sleazy drunkard Busey who wants to be her manager His mother committed suicide his fathers an alcoholic as well and he has a violent temper You can imagine where that leads In the meantime theres music aplenty as Parton with her fluid vocal talents belts out song after song at least half a dozen of them about Texas Steer clear of this mess and check her out in NINE TO FIVE or STEEL MAGNOLIAS instead,negative
This has to be one of the worst movies ever to come out of the SciFi Channel Here is how the movie starts Women are the only humans on this planet due to the fact that in the not to distant future chemical warfare is A OK as long as it only targets soldiers In case your wondering Men However the virus back fires Big shockand all the men on earth slowly die Then all of male kind is condemned to die when the madam president is shot and killed by a man now we are taken around 60 to 70 years from now two female scientists are working on cloning a female baby and one of them says Hey why dont we bring men back The other one says no the world is not ready for that but promptly ignores her and thus a man walks the Eath againbr br First off this movie assumes that all men who are not genetically altered are blood thirsty monsters Secondly the writer forgot to mention that present day soldiers are a good mix of Male and Female officers so there is no real reason to have a virus like that This is the biggest waist of time you can find This movie managed to insult my intellect not only by the bad story but with the Lifetime style acting Avoid this movie at all costsbr br I give this a 1 out of 10 but only because I could go no lower,negative
Its Showtime Showtime is simply a bump in Eddie Murphy and Robert DeNiros careers Its an entertaining movie and a guilty pleasure but not quite up to the actors standards especially not Roberts Showtime is directed by Tom Dey and features some small roles from guys like William Shatner and Mos Defbr br Showtime is about two very different cops Mitch Preston DeNiro and Trey Sellars Murphy One takes work seriously in a low profile quiet manner while the other is more easygoing and wants to have more fun than felons in his back seat They are both after the same felons behind a huge caper of televisions VCRs etc They then cross paths and a TV station wants a new reality TV show so they fight crime while they are on TV Mitch hates the publicity while Trey loves it with his line Its Showtime Their TV antics and methods are shown on TV and they are the new Cops show The fun beginsbr br Overall Showtime is a fun action comedy A good film but not quite up to the actors expectations and standards However its rolls along as it treads and parodies reality TV shows A good break from shows like Cops Truly at the end just a guilty pleasurebr br My Rating 710br br Eliason A,positive
This may not be the most exiting or incredible episode theyve made but in my opinion it remains as one of Star Trek and the SciFi genres most original episodes Most ideas from retro SciFi series especially including Star Trek has been reused several times this one the other hand remains mostly as a one time triumph This among the episodes that impressed me the most towards the endbr br Another thing I like with this episode is how it has accomplished to create such and exiting and captivating story with such few special affects Now without criticizing the episode I must admit the effects are very dated but then again what can you expect from a TV show from 1967 But still the creature Horta in this episode is basically just a carpet with some coloured rubber on it Yet you forget this after about 1 minute and you only start thinking about it as what its supposed to be Also the caves dont exactly look like rock but again you forget it after a few minutes This episode is a living proof on how good acting and a good story can make you ignore the visual effectsbr br The acting from the main cast is as usual great This episode features the series second mind meld by Spock and is one of my favourites So to say it simple Leonard Nimoy is definitely a scene stealer here and his acting is excellent Not that Kirk or Bones dont get their share of the episode but Spock is the most intriguing in this one i like the fact that the episode is not about one specific character but evolves around the trio handling an alien problem Also its nice to see an episode who doesnt only happen on the Enterprisebr br Like most Star Trek episodes this episode tells us to have an open mind I wont spoil the story but evolves around what in the start seems like a typical monster story It has killed several humans and therefore must be killed But is that really all there is to it I can assure you that the explanation in the end will not disappoint you This is still my favourite Star Trek TOS episode and i give it a 1010,positive
The role of Buddy Ackerman is no stretch for Kevin Spacey Hes played version of that character many times other better films This is fortunate because it gives his performance a certain resonance without which Buddy would be as flat and incomplete as all of the other characters in this pointless little farce The script leaves little time for plot or character development resembling a porn flick in its rush to get to the good stuff The difference is that here the good stuff isnt people pleasuring each other but inflicting pain making it appropriate viewing for young adultsbr br Of course theres nothing wrong with a porn flick if you want to watch people having sex and I guess theres nothing wrong with Swimming with Sharks if you want to watch people undergoing physical emotional and psychological torture But if youre looking for incisive satire interesting characters or anything else that even attempts to engage more than your basest passions you should probably look elsewhere,negative
To paraphrase Thora Birch I kind of like this movie Its the exact opposite of everything I hate in a filmbr br This obscure film was too low key and intelligent to get a theatrical release any chance for success would have needed a costly promotional campaign And a coming of age story where nothing spectacular happens  where instead the focus is on character development has a limited target audience Whoever heard of a mature teen moviebr br But if you have an opportunity to see this or if you can part with a few bucks for the DVD you could do a lot worse My Teachers Wife is nothing revolutionary but it has a lot going for it and holds up well to repeated viewingsbr br Jason London as high school senior Todd Boomer is the star and fits this character as well as his parts in The Man In the Moon and Dazed and Confused He is helped out by exceptional work from his supporting cast Tia Carrere in the title role is a revelation she can act as Todds calculus tutor and love interest Christopher McDonald as the teacher in a nice selfparodying performance Zak Orth and Alexondra Lee as Todds best friends and Jeffrey Tabor as his father br br As someone commented earlier this is a mature teen movie because the romantic relationships are universally unsuccessfulat least by traditional happy ending standards Even Todds parents are indifferent to each other with his father panting after the title character and his mother Leslie Lyles literally on the telephone during her entire time on screen a device that provides increasing comedy relief with each successive appearance The LondonCarrere romance has unexpected charm and is far more believable than any other older woman storyline you are likely to find br br But the real strength of the film is the evolving relationship of the three friends There is no overwrought melodrama here just three immature people who alternate between testing and trusting each other subject to all the dynamics that three young people can bring to this kind of thing They actually manage to pull off a believable threeperson relationship perhaps the first one in cinema history br br Then again what do I know Im only a child,positive
In what could have been seen as a coup towards the sexual revolution purposefully I use quotations for that word Jean Eustache wrote and directed The Mother and the Whore as a poetic damning critique of those who cant seem to get enough love If there is a message to this film and Id hope that the message would come only after the fact of what else this BenHur length feature has to offer its that in order to love honestly there has to be some level of happiness of real truth Is it possible to have two lovers Some can try but what is the outcome if no one can really have what they really want or feel they can even express to say what they want br br What is the truth in the relationships that Alexandre JeanPierre Leaud has with the women around him Hes a twentysomething pseudointellectual not with any seeming job and he lives off of a woman Marie Bernadette Lafont slightly older than him and is usually if not always his lover his last possible loveofhislife left him and then right away he picks up a woman he sees on the street Veronika Françoise Lebrun who perhaps reminds him of her Soon what unfolds is the most subtly torrid love triangle ever put on film where the psychological strings are pulled with the cruelest words and the slightest of gestures At first we think it might be all about what will happen to Alexandre but were mistaken The women are so essential to this question of love and sex that they have to be around talking on and on for something to sink inbr br Were told that part of the sexual revolution in theory if not entirely in practice perhaps it was I cant say having not been alive in the period to see it firsthand was that freedom led to a lack of inhibitions But Eustaches point if not entirely message is that its practically impossible to have it both ways you cant have people love you and expect to get the satisfaction of ultimate companionship that arrives with fing as the characters refer over and over again br br The Mother and the Whores strengths as far as having the theme is expressing this dread beneath the promiscuity the lack of monogamy while also stimulating the intellect in the talkiest talk youve ever seen in a movie At the same time we see a character like Alexandre who probably loves to hear himself talk whether its about some movie he saw or something bad from his past Eustache makes it so that the film itself isnt pretentious though it could appear to be but that its about pretentiousness what lies beneath those who are covering up for their internal flaws what they need to use when theyre ultimately alone in the morning br br If you thought films like Before SunriseSunset were talky relationship flicks you havent met this But as Eustache revels in the dialogs these characters have sometimes trivial or deep or sexual or frank or occasionally extremely or in a subdued manner emotional its never ever uninteresting or boring On the contrary for those who cant get enough of a good talky film its exceptional While his style doesnt call out to the audaciousness that came with his forerunners in the nouvelle vague a dozen years beforehand Eustaches newwave touch is with the characters and then reverberating on thembr br This is realism with a spike of attitude with things at time scathing and sarcastic crude and without shame in expression All three of the actors are so glued to their characters that we cant ever perceive them as faking an emotion or going at all into melodrama Its almost TOO good in naturalisticrealism terms but for Eustaches material there is no other way around it Luckily Leaud delivers the crowning chip of his career of the period and both ladies particularly Labrun as the whore Veronika a claim she staggeringly refutes in the films climax of sorts in one unbroken shot And as another touch every so often the director will dip into a quiet moment of thought of a character sitting by themselves listening to a record and in contemplation or quiet agony This is probably the biggest influence on Jim Jarmusch who dedicated his film Broken Flowers to Eustache and has one scene in particular that is lifted completely and lovingly in approach from the late Parisianbr br Sad to say before I saw Broken Flowers I never heard of Eustache or this film and procuring it has become quite a challenge not available on US DVD and on VHS so rare it took many months of tracking at various libraries Not a minute of that time was wasted the Mother and the Whore is truly beautiful work one of the best of French relationship dramas maybe even just one of the most staggeringly lucid Ive seen from the country in general Its complex its sweet its cold its absorbing and its very long perhaps too long Its also satisfying on the kind of level that Id compare to Scenes from a Marriage true revelations about the human condition continue to arise 35 years after each films release,positive
After three hours in the Cinema hallthe strongest impression garnered was that their is something amiss What was clear was that the Directors forgot to direct the actors to act and most importantly the script writer to write Evervbody shouted without reason and made one cringe The script moved on and on with lots of avoidable twists and turns ending in now too familiar Priyadarshan theory of Converging actors at a single point This theory worked well in HeraPheri and Hungama but somehow managed to irritate this time so did the habit of every actors incapacity to answer asked of them directly Simplest questions such as  what is your name would be repeated N timesbr br Finally what was amiss was that the director forgot that his audience have something called intelligence,negative

Dutch Schultz AKA Arthur Fleggenheimer was a real person and his rather nasty life is fairly well documented This movie which purports to depict his life should have used a fictional character because the overdramatized events are too strong a departure from the facts and the chronology Not only that it ignores some interesting details which other versions have included such as the public relations fiasco in upstate NY and his religious conversion It is true that he was executed by Luciano Lansky et al but thats as far as it goes The exploding plate scene which represents Luciano carrying out the execution of Bo Weinberg in his own home assisted by his own mother is rediculous Also there is the scene in which Dutch approaches his own mother to pay protection to Legs Diamond It just doesnt work The character of Mrs Fleggenheimer doesnt work either This movie does not need a doting Jewish mother for comic relief The lame representation of Legs Diamond was humorous enough Im sure the man is turning in his grave And by the way Dutch did in fact personally kill people but he was not Rambo or 007 The scene in which he wipes out the brewery is absurd I dont know Maybe it was supposed to be a comedy and I just didnt get it,negative

haha you have to just smile and smile if you actually made it all the way through this movie it like says something about myself i guess the movie itself was created i think as some sort of psychological test or like some sort of drug to take you to a place you have never been before When Wittgenstein wrote his famous first philosophical piece the tractacus sp he said it was meaningless and useless but if you read it after you were done it would take you to a new level like a ladder and then you could throw away the work and see things with clarity and true understanding this movie is the same i thinkbr br As a movie it is without a doubt the worst movie i have seen in a long long time in such a unique way first of all this is snipes i loved watching this guy kick ass in various movies and i have suffered through a few weak ones however although you know the movie might suck you would never suspect that it could be as bad as it actually was which is the fun of it i mean this is snipes you know it might be good but it will be alright right smilebr br so this thing on every level is pure boredom pure unoriginality the reference to the professional is both dead on and obvious yet so poorly done as to be comical there is not one character in this movie that is interesting in the least and to make the whole thing more surreal they have a soundtrack that sort of sounds like parts to various Bourne identity type movies only isnt quite right in fact although it seems close to action movie background music it just so happens it is done in a manner that will grate on you fantasticallybr br then all the scenes in the total pitch black where honestly since the characters are so flat you dont really care whats going to happen but regardless after it happens and someone is killed you just say to yourself was i supposed to see that what else how about scenes with blinding obnoxious flashing at a strobe lights pace for a period of time that is too long to bear sure lets throw that in how bout this though when you are straining and your eyes cant handle it any longer do some more of these in the dark kills where you really dont see what happened and on top of that lets face it you dont care you were past bored way from the beginningbr br so i drifted in and out a couple times but i caught almost all of this movie and it becomes something you can watch without something that engages your mind on any level therefore it becomes something you can effectively zone out with and begin to think about your life where its going where its been what we are as peoplebr br and that that is the true magic of this film,negative
TROMEO  JULIET  10TH ANNIVERSARY EDITIONbr br William Shakespeares play Romeo  Juliet has been interpreted hundreds of times on stage and in films Sometimes literally following the original text which is at times vague in stage directions sometimes in new interpretations where directors chose to show their own view on the piece Some are good many are mediocre Lloyd Kaufmans film certainly stands out as one of the most original modern versions of the bards creation It may be placed in a modernday decaying New York and full of the modernday antisocial behavior body piercing dismemberment and kinky sex which for the more than casual reader Shakespeare himself wasnt shying away from but at the same time it stays incredibly close to the overall feel and point of what the play is all about which is quite an effort Kaufman wrote the script with his codirector on the film James Gunn who is now famous for writing two successful Scooby Doo movies doing the impossible by making a perfect remake of an already perfect film with his script for Dawn of the Dead and directing one of the best horrorfilms of the year Slither Lloyd Kaufmans innovative directorial view alongside with James Gunns original and unrestricted writing make for an interpretation of Shakespeares play that maybe not everyone will get immediately but will certainly be recognized by a truly unique and highly important view on a classic play With a script that is written entirely in iambic meter appearances of Motorheads Lemmy and an outrageous forceful soundtrack watching Tromeo  Juliet is something no one will ever forget Apart from its historical significance Tromeo  Juliet is a treasure for filmlovers of all kind Not only for the script by James Gunn now a good influence on Hollywood while working from the inside but also because it features an early part of legendary actress Debbie Rochon Well known by everyone familiar with films that are made on lower budgets The 10th anniversary edition on DVD adds to all that by including so many asyet undiscovered gems that not only all the information one could wish for about the film itself and the experience of making it is presented in ways that make it impossible to turn off the DVD but also a very honest and disturbing look is given into the ways independent cinema has to surviver these days In many ways the extras on the disc are an invaluable addition to the already impressive amount given on Kaufmans filmschool Make Your Own Damn Movie Furtermore historical items from the Troma vaults which include James Gunn Debbie Rochon and all other contributors to this masterpiece are included and the film itself is apart from looking better then ever accompanied by no less than four audiocommentaries each and everyone informative excruciatingly funny and all done for serious addition to the film instead of the boring and nonsensical commentaries that are so common these days There are new commentaries one with Kaufman and Gunn together but also the one James Gunn did for the original release of the DVD but couldnt be included there for some of honesty he displays about some other people is present on this disc With fanrecreations of a few of the scenes from the film a video diary of Lloyd Kaufmans visit to the set of James Gunns Slither and a visit the two brought together to Eli Roths Hostel Birthday party and much more this is the ultimate set everyone must own Weather you are a film historian someone interested in interpretations of the great Bards work a fan of great cinema a fighter for independent cinema a fan of James Gunn interested in learning more on making films on a low budget a fan of Lloyd Kaufman or whatever this is the most important DVDrelease of this millennium,positive

Why did I have to go out and buy yes buy JACK FROST 2 REVENGE OF THE MUTANT KILLER SNOWMAN Maybe it was a burst of temporary mental derangement But Im guessing its because I kind of enjoyed the first JACK FROST It was a silly but funny horrorcomedy which had some okay effects by Screaming Mad George That and the fact that on the backcover of the sequel there was this nice picture of this guy impaled by this giant icicle coming out of his mouth with a lot of blood and all So I thought if its as idiotic as the first and has some nice splattergore in it it should be fun right Well I was so dead wrong br br Let me first say that the movie deserves some credit for having an immensely insane and retarded plot I mean a mutant killer snowman on a tropical island that spawns mutant killer baby snowballs which can only be killed or harmed by bananas As much as I love the premise I really hated the movie First of all while the first JACK FROST looked like an actual movie seemingly being shot on real film and all this sequel has the look and feel of a thirdrate soapopera It has this way too slick shotonvideo look The lighting is just plain awful bright white spots for the day look and stupid colors like blue and green at night The acting well dont even go there The dialogues range from stiff to extremely senile that Jamaican man was just moronic saying man after every sentence And when it comes to the voice of the killer snowman all I could think of was a seventhrate Chucky from CHILDS PLAY spewing dumb and supposedly witty oneliners before he kills someonebr br The best joke was were one guy asks Why are you talking to your watch And the best scene was undoubtedly the one with that beautiful Asian chick popping up out of nowhere and taking a swim in the pool totally naked thank god for that Oh yeah and that little scene over the endcredits with those two Japanese dudes on a miniature ship being badly dubbed had me laughing too But the worst thing about this movie was Where was the gore and splatter action everyone is talking about There were plenty of occasions to show some decent gory killings A lot of people were killed off in original ways here but all offscreen Like Ive read in many other comments there were indeed nice setups to a head explosion a crushed body eyes being poked out tongue ripped out but on the crucial moments the editor cuts away to some blood splatters on the floor or nothing at all That frontal shot of that British guy being impaled from the backcover of the DVD wasnt even in the movie I only saw that particular killing filmed from the back meaning I didnt see sht I was waiting throughout the whole movie for that to happen and then I get to see nothing What a letdown Could it be that I saw a cut version of the movie That would be a shame cause only a decent amount of splatterfun could have saved this movie if you ask me Seeing a lot of killer snowballs reduced to bloody pulp just didnt cut it for me Speaking of those snowballs they were done very poorly They made MUNCHIES look like stateoftheart animatronics But I guess that was the whole point of it At some point the special effects crew even turned to some laughably bad CGI Boy you really have to see it to believe it Best is to not see it actually cause this flick is just too bad okay I did laugh with it for it kept getting worse and worse Just stick with the first JACK FROST 1996 and youll be okay just bare in mind that its a pretty silly horrorcomedy but fun in its own rightbr br Its funny but writerdirector Michael Cooney somehow must have realized that he was a pretty bad director after JACK FROST 2 and then focused on writing Turns out he then wrote two pretty good thriller screenplays for THE I INSIDE starring Ryan Phillippe and IDENTITY starring John Cusack So the man seems to have some talent after allbr br Now it would be far too easy to give JACK FROST 2 the lowest rating possible So I say one point for that naked Asian babe doing the skinny dipping and one point for those completely retarded snowball babies Way to go Mr Cooney,negative

Brilliant actors and brilliant picture I love the chopper scene with the music in the beginning it is just SO touching and at the same time real but at the same time surrealistic The Vietnam War was far from human and I believe this movie kind of shows have terrible human beings can act under certain circumstances Modern war movies are spending so much money on effects This is just a straight forward smart movie that takes you beyond your imagination A movie that really pictures evil and hate mixed in fearness and fate How insane the world is and the power of will and friendship love and passion A must seen movie and without any doubts the best war movie ever Many tried to copy but still there are no movie even close as good as this,positive

I have some great memories watching Robin of Sherwood on TV as a kid but I think I only saw Michael Praeds episodes by some reason And recently my brother bought the new released DVDboxes of the complete series It was great to see it again and it is the best of all the Robin Hood movies and TVseries The cast is great and the locations mixed with Clannads music adds this very special feeling I personally think that Praed is the best of the two Robins but Jason Connery was a great choice to continue the series with Ray Winstone Nicolas Grace and Robert Addie is terrific in their roles as Will Scarlet The Sheriff of Nottingham and Guy of Gisburne Its a pity that a fourth season never got made and Ive also heard that the writer Richard Carpenter actually had plans to make a feature film following the events of the series Robert of Huntingdon Connery could finally have married Marion Judi Trott or maybe Herne the Hunter could resurrect Robin of Loxley Praed and he could take his revenge against the sheriff As have been mentioned before if the producers of Robin Hood The Prince of Thieves would have been smart they would have got the cast from Robin of Sherwood and made the movie to a sort of sequel to the series As Ray Winstone puts it in the DVD bonusmaterial it would have been great to see them as old men just like in Sean Connerys Robin and Marian Who knows maybe we will se more of this perfect interpretation of the legend in the future In any case we can now watch our favorite series over and over again,positive

The Screaming Skull opens with a warning and an offer for free burial services if you should die watching it  Now theres a hook The story itself has a fairly interesting premise for a horror flick scheming husband marries a wealthy woman with a history of mental illness then attempts to convince her that shes going insane with shrill noises mysterious knocking and skulls that turn up at inopportune times Add to the formula a sufficiently creepy gardener who still cherishes the memory of the mans first wife who he was devoted to Maybe its just that the 1950s didnt have the technology to pull off some of the scare scenes needed to juice up this movie the techniques used here seem contrived and mundane But then again when I first saw House on Haunted Hill as a nine year old it gave me the heebie jeebies in the same way Im sure this film did for young viewers of the same erabr br Dont get me wrong the film is not terrible it just seems to get tedious at times But theres some great atmospheric tension in the generally huge but unfurnished Whitlock home and the gardens and pool are a nice touch For me the best played out scene involves Eric Whitlock John Hudson going maniacal in the pond attempting to retrieve the hidden skull he just wades right in clothes and all in neat contrast to the mentally challenged gardener director Alex Nicol in a dual role It makes you wonder who the real dimwit wasbr br In its own good way perhaps the most shocking thing about the film how about that neat roadster the Whitlocks make their first appearance in  gull wing doors in 1958 That at least made me jump out of my seat,negative
just cant watch this bit too many times its full of true enthusiasm and cleverness Mickey Mouse had in his first 30 years Nowadays Mickey is an smart ass little whiner when compared this Steamboat Willie always makes me smile at least the ending where Mickey laughs after hitting a parrot with a potato Animation is very nice and although steamboat Willie has no dialog the music is enough for itbr br IMHO if this bit doesnt deserve 1010 then any cartoon doesnt not only because its a true classic but also because its so full of joy and its always fun to watch,positive

Its a great American martial arts movie The fighting scenes were pretty impressive for American movie made in 90s Of course the fighting scenes arent that good as in Honk Kong movies actually only few American movies have fighting scenes which are as good as in Honk Kong movies even nowadays When you watch American martial arts movie you are expecting to see less impressive fighting scenes but still having some nice moves which can be surprisingly good sometimes or at least thats what Im expecting from these movies I was impressed by this film Some fighting scenes were really impressive the acting direction and the plot were good enough so its a really worth watching movie if you like American martial arts films of the 90s,positive
Peter Jacksons versions are better films overall from objective point of view That being said they are not my favorite screen versions of Lord Of The Rings and let me explain why br br Firstly the acting of the onscreen characters is just too ordinary and uninspiring with Jacksons LOTR The whole cast is too run of the mill Are you claiming that those silly cartoon characters of Ralph Bakshi version are better actors than real people one could ask Well they are not really sillysave for Hobbits later about them and they certainly pack more personality than Jacksons party  even with much more limited dialogue time And that is because of superior _voice_ acting of the Bakshis LOTR Take Aragorn for example In this version his voice is deep and charismatic with full of authorityAragorn the lordand with a seasoned raspAragorn the ranger This is due to John Hurts brilliant voice acting Compare that to Viggo Mortensens rather high pitched sound with no soul and the duel gets quickly uneven Hurt beats Mortensen hands down br br And then there is Gandalf Probably the most dominatingand the most popular character in the whole saga In this Bakshi version GandalfWilliam Squire is a real wizard And by that I dont mean he shoots bolts from his fingertipshe does not but his presence is just captivating He is a mystical powerful and can switch from gentle old man to a scary person with ease Add to that his looks Tall old as the ancient oak beard long as his body sharp eyes wizardy hook nose and of course the classical wizard hat A Perfect Gandalf just like in the books Ian McKellens Gandalf in the other hand is simply just too boring He looks too human sounds too human acts too human and wears no hat or wields no sword Yes a sword In this Bakshi version Gandalf scores couple of bloody orc kills with his swordas he did in the books And those are stylish slow motion kills Gandalf is not a power to be messed with And it must be noted that while Im sad to say this the great Christopher Lee didnt bring Saruman alive Fraser Kerr in this movie did even with a very limited screen time and linesbr br Before I move completely to visual aspects of the movie it must be mentioned that the voice acting and the general presenation of the Orcs are also superior to Jacksons pretendeous bad guys Bakshis orcs taunt their enemiesor each other constantly with growls screams and nasty language They are more believable as monsters and are more faithful to the book in my opinion And finally the Black Riders  or the Nazgul Those ultimate bad guys are scary ghosts in this one  not just some riders wearing black And they speak with haunting voice which mesmerizes their victim My favorite scene in the film is when the Nazgul are chasing Frodo near the river While Peter Jackson couldnt do anything but show the riders simply chasing the party Bakshi throws in a nightmarish dream with some cool slow motion scenes and thundering skybr br But as much I like this film more than Jacksons the latter are if only technically still better And that is because of some key visuals As you know Bakshi LOTR features a mixture of animated charactersall hobbits and the main cast and real actors covered with paint I dont really have a problem using real people in animation this way but they just dont fit very well with traditional cartoon figures This is especially true with humansRiders of Rohan tavern people etc Orcs are different matter since they are meant to look very distinctive from other characters Orcs while played by humans with animation mix look far superior to Jacksons version They have brownishgreen skin shiny red eyes flat face and pointed teeth br br Biggest screw up in this films visuals howerver are the Hobbits While I prefer almost every character in Bakshi version compared to Jackson the latter has clearly superior Hobbits in fact they are perfect With Bakshi you get some irritating and rather poorly drawn humanoid Disney bambies And you are forced to spend a lot of movie time with them so be warned Again the voice acting is OK with them too but the actors mouths cannot save the immersion damage made by these little weasels Well I never really liked those halflings anyway br br General failures in the Bakshi script are well known Limited playing timewith limited budget and a lot of missing scenes So while this film covers nearly half of the story it doesnt do it in extensive detail compared to Jacksons version br br In a summary the Ralph Bakshi version of LOTR has a superiorbr br overall atmosphere it feels more like MiddleEarth overall voice acting music I really dig the fantasy score by Kont  Rosenman Gandalf Aragorn One of the John Hurts finest roles King Theoden Orcs Black Riders Elrond Hes not some fairy hippie in this onebr br While Jackson version is betterbr br because it covers the whole story overall visuals and special effects GollumSmeagol Balrog Hobbitsbr br Lord of the Rings by Ralph Bakshi even with its well known shortcomings is one of the best animation films ever made and it captures the atmosphere of Tolkiens fantasy world very well if not perfectly Ill give it a score of 8½ out of 10,positive
This is in my opinion a very good film especially for Michael Jackson lovers It contains a message on drugs stunning special effects and an awesome music videobr br The main film is centered around the song and music video Smooth Criminal Unlike the fourminute music video it is normal speed and in my opinion much easier to watchbr br The plot is rather weird however Michael Jackson plays a magical gangster that when he sees a shooting star he transforms into a piece of machinery Throughout the film he transforms into a race car a giant robot and a space shipbr br The robot scene in particular is a bit drawn out and strange I found it a little outofwhack compared to the rest of the filmbr br A child is kidnapped Michael tries to save her is tortured and beaten and suddenly turns into a giant robot that blows up all the bad guys A little weird Yeahbr br But besides the bizarre robot scene its a very good movie and any Michael Jackson fan will enjoy both the Smooth Criminal music video and the movie,positive
I like this movie because it is a fine work of cinema made by people who care enough to make it art and not just home movies It is filled with Supersurfer Greg Nolls home movies and a boatload of amateur video from others who align themselves with his 50year passion Nevertheless it has been expanded to the degree that it approaches aesthetic glory It is filled with artistic talent and athletic talent however trivial you might think surfing to be athletic Surfers are not astronauts nor testpilots Nor are they surgeonsperhaps or Phdsagain perhaps It believes in the quest of the surfer It believes in the beauty of human goofiness It believes in the great gift of peace which comes from the cessation of war Surfers celebrate the cessation of war on the north beach of an Hawaiian island attacked by Japanese zeroes fifteen years before It celebrates the downtime of a country which fought a cold warinstead of a hotwar  with the Russian socialists Surfing is the ultimate narcissism It is dangerous but only slightly historical I suspect Alexander the Great would not be celebrated for his surfing technique He had to go out and conquer a few dozen countries to get the favorable press he has received This movie has no military heroes It has no guns The only beachhead surfers conquer has a beerstand and and a surfboard shop This is not a problem Peace is not desperate It is the joy of exhalation,positive

My introduction to a lifelong love of Shakespeare My brother was 5 and I was not quite 7 when WTTW Chicago broadcast An Age of Kings It became a family ritual to watch including the reruns As an autumn series my father used to buy us a rare treat for the Midwestpomegranates and my mother would pop corn on the stove Wonderful acting from actors whose names meant nothing to me then although I will never forget the achingly young Sean Connery as Hotspur but do now And they published the scripts in paperback so we could follow along and figure out the language I managed to memorize most of Richard III over that So glad to see it coming out on DVD Highly recommended for all ages and any level of familiarity with Shakespeare or English history,positive

I have to say that I had low expectations for the movie before viewing it All the people around said it was great but I perfectly knew what they like They like Aerosmiths song which is indeed great they like the amazing special effects which had coasted a lot they like the comedy side of the movie and of course many girls who love Affleck who according to my opinion is a really bad actor who tried not to be one failed and now he is nothing And all these things plus the reviews and the ratings I read in internet gave me a clue the movie would be a huge disappointment since I am a big disaster kind of movies fan Well Ive been right but at least I was preparedbr br The movie is really commercial Its been said but I will say it as again We have over 100 million budget we have a romance between Hollywood stars Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler and many other famous actors who are popular with the fact that they rarely agree on becoming a part of the cast of a commercial movie if their names arent written with big letters on the screen Such as Billy Bob Thornton and Steve Buscemi which are highly respected actors that I also like a lot They could play many characters in many different kind of movies They could improvise they could turn tasteless lines into hilarious jokes On the whole they could turn small movies into really interesting funny or dramatic motion pictures people love and will always love Such as Fargo in Buscemis case or A Simple Plan  Thornton And to be honest I am really disappointed they took part of Armageddon Thornton plays a smart and refined man involved in politics if I remember correctly Buscemi is one of the members of the deep core drilling team which is sent to save the world by destroying the asteroid which is about to vanish the worldbr br What I didnt like  well I guess Ive been already understood I pointed out bad factors The story is dull artless and silly It is so obvious that the movie depends on the effects and the dramatic ending that its ridiculous At least movies like Deep Impact and Godzilla have something special that might be considered as art At least it aint that obvious that the movie is made of financial purposes Other than that bad performances from all the huge stars The jokes aint funny the lines are absurd and sometimes they doesnt make sense at all In fact I recently read that on the stage Ben Affleck has asked Bay whether it would be easier if they teach astronauts to drill than drillers to becomes astronauts and Bays reply has been simply Shut up which is a really funny story which perfectly shows the creatorss desperationbr br And enclosing Ill give an explanation why I give 4 to the movie Well I like Dont Want to Miss a thing and I was impressed by the special effects which are obviously the only good thing in the movie The first scene is memorable These are the the only 2 good things I liked about the movie Michael Bay is an average director but The Rock and both Bad Boys were hundreds of times better than Armageddon which was is and will always be one big bad movie,negative

The first time I saw this film I loved it When I was 11 I was more interested in the music and dancing As Ive grown older Ive become more interested in the acting as well While the first half is just a retrospective of Michaels career from the Jackson 5 up to Bad it was still entertaining to watch The Badder sequence couldve been left out though the kids were pretty good Speed Demon and Leave Me Alone were funny especially when the police officer tells Michael I need your autograph right here after stopping him for dancing in a nodancing zone But its Smooth Criminal thats the icing on the cake Joe Pesci did an excellent job as the toughie and that hair was wild The dancing is perfect and so are the special effects The only thing I could have done without was the spiders Any fan of Michaels should see this if you havent already I give it a 10,positive

example he thinks he sees evidence of lasercutting on ancient stonework So theyre at Machu Picchu looking for more evidence of Simons theories when they happen upon a secret chamber Inside they quickly find the animal they later dub Arnold one of the titular munchiesbr br They take Arnold back home to their small California desert town Simon who thinks that Arnold is probably an alien creature has to go off to a colleagues lecture and he plans on telling the colleague that he finally has an alien specimen Paul and his extremely cute girlfriend Cindy Nadine Van der Velde are left in charge of Arnold but as they havent seen each other in a long time they leave Arnold unsupervised while they hop in the sackbr br Meanwhile Simons brother Cecil played also by Korman in a dual role owner of a successful snack foods company is eager to buy off Simons home and landtheyre adjacent to his own Simon doesnt want to sell so Cecil hits upon a scheme to steal Arnold Things gradually spiral out of control and the munchies who have a mean streak to go along with their cravings for junk food begin to overrun the townbr br That reads better in a summary than it plays on the screen The best shots in the film are those with natural landscapes in the background such as when characters are driving on the outskirts of the desert town Interiors with the exception of Cecils home tend to look like poorly decorated cheap sets and more importantly they tend to show that Hirsch is not very skilled at blocking and setting up shots Oddly given the paucity of the production design overall Cecils home is quite a gem imbued as it is in overblown 1980s style down to the smallest details and Cecils stepson Dude Jon Stafford was an amusing counterpoint Too bad then that hes out of the film so quicklybr br At any rate Korman is a fun actor but he comes across much better here as Simon than as Cecil Unfortunately Simon ends up being absent for most of the film Cecil who is differentiated physically by a ridiculous wig and facial hair is not only the evil capitalist of the film hes one of Kormans classic inconsiderate boorish charactersthat was one of his specialties frequently capitalized on in Carol Burnett Show 1967 skits Unlike The Carol Burnett Show which tended to succeed because directors Clark Jones and Dave Powers had a studied way of pushing the skits just to the brink of chaos Hirsch reins Korman in way too far and the Cecil character just doesnt work the way it shouldbr br There are a lot of other directorrelated problems not the least of which is wonky pacing and editing which completely sap any possible suspense or compelling dramatic impact from the film Even scenes that should have been shoeins for amping up the dramasuch as when the munchies are harassing an old lady on the roadare put together far too awkwardly to have much affectbr br There are also serious logical problems with the story as it stands Where did the munchie in the chamber at Machu Picchu come from The films trailer seems to show an answer to this but it was edited out of the final cut A more serious problem is that unlike gremlins there is no clear reason for munchies to go from cute cuddly furballs to menacing monsters It just happens Further because Munchies was kept PG and the violence remains toned down when the creatures are in their monster phase theyre never very threatening Theyre also easily dispatched at least temporarilybr br Admittedly the gist of the film isnt suspense horror compelling drama or any of that other stuff but humor Its intended more as a spoof of Gremlins and the countless ripoffs in its wake The only problem with that is that the film just isnt funny even though I chuckled a couple times A surprisingly high percentage of the jokes are bland clichés Too much of the remaining material consists of nonsequiturs Given bad timing from Hirsch it all just falls flat There was potential to make a film that while a spoof was both funny and frightening hilarious and disturbing cheesy and suspenseful all at the same time ala Killer Klowns from Outer Space 1988 Too bad then that Munchies comes nowhere near that,negative
Connie Hoffman is very pretty and is attractively topless at timesbr br Thats it folks The sole reason for even considering whether to watch this film or notbr br These 70s sexploitation period pieces are sometimes entertaining by virtue of their very datedness flared trousers big hair Zapata moustaches etc This one isntbr br The script is bad the acting is bad the direction is bad and the idea of having a senior citizen romantic leading man is exceptionally badbr br The title hinting at a sex comedy is grossly misleadingbr br I heartily recommend avoiding this one like the plague,negative
Ever wonder why Pacific Islanders seem to automatically assume the sense of humour of Black Americans regardless of their ethnic origins Well this film will not provide any answers to this often pondered question  but it will provide an excellent case studybr br From its onset this film acts as a sort of Old School for Pacific Island New Zealanders which immediately raises the question what exactly is the point of such a task Is it meant to perpetuate ingrained stereotypes of Pacific Island New Zealanders or is it intended to exploit this potential market The story is weak jokes humorless and the ending is expected This film has done nothing for New Zealand cinema as it is merely an appropriated romantic comedy that is devoid of any merit,negative
Lost is an extremely well made TV series about some people that are lost on an island theres so many twists and turns that you cant really decide who your favourite character is one minute its him then he does something so hes coolest then shes about to do something so shes the coolest then suspense builds up and just as you are about to burst the episode ends and your like nooooooooooooooooooooso you have to wait a whole week too see the next episode but it is worth the wait Suspense action romance humour its got it all apart from the topless girls but thats good as it means that you can actually concentrate on the story more and story is what this is all about so if you like a good story and like suspense this is a good one however 24 i think is probably betteri have a review on that too that you could check it out I would give lost a good 8 out of 10 mainly because its so unpredictable you never know what will happen next,positive
Heres another Antonioni that will be rediscovered again and again as soon as it comes out on tape or DVD I saw it a few months ago when it ran for the first time even in metropolitan movie capital LAfor a couple of weeks and then disappeared art house audiences seem to have opted for their own special territory where older favorites like Antonioni and Resnais are only welcome as occasional curiositiesbr br At first I was disappointed thought the pace to be unbearably boring and that the man had lost a chance for years Antonioni had found it difficult to find financingat an advanced age to add another masterpiece to his canon but knowing Antonioni for what he was and how I had at first reacted to BlowUp and the Passenger I refused to pass judgment until I had seen the film again I went back the next day and I should not have been surprised that the film kept pulling me in making me aware of things I had thought about and lost track of throughout my life driving home in a contemporary setting points exposed for the first time some forty years ago in LAventurra forming an environment of subtle moods so characteristcally and fascinatingly alienated in tone and quite comedic actually that I couldnt get enough The scene with Malkovich sitting on the fancy colored swings on the windswept beach with the weather so beautifully silver skied and the EnoU2 track in the background flowing through at just its rhythm had been my favorite it still was but now the whole film was just as great What a strange phenomenon the complex simplicity or the invisible complex which Antonionis eye alone seems to be able to pick up and communicate The odd thing is though it does look at first glance like a softcore porno of some kind and it does feature plenty of sex and the maddeningly gorgeous Sophie Marceau and plently of other international stars to distract you this film is unmistakably Antonionis to its core but you will not sense to what a profound extent until you have seen it a few times and got used to its rhythm For example it is quite a funny film with a deep sense of humor something I did not notice at first but was turned on to by another critic and noticed to much delight on further viewings 4 before they pulled it and wouldve gone back for more If this film had been promoted right and people guided to a certain extent as to how to approach it I have no doubt it would have succeeded on the art house circuit like most of Antonionis 60s films But the 60s are no more and the film will have to find its audience on the small screen where half its beauty will be lost even in a letterboxed DVD version if and when its released I urge all film nuts general or esoteric to see Beyond the Clouds and add a piece of magic to the tragic,positive

Frank Capras creativity must have been just about spent by the time he made this film While it has a few charming moments and many wonderful performers Capras outright recycling of not just the script but considerable footage from his first version of this story Broadway Bill 1934 is downright shoddy It is understandable that he would reuse footage from the climactic horse race which is thrilling But he uses entire dialogue scenes with minor actors then brings back those actors and apparently expects us not to notice for example that Ward Bond is 14 years older Unless you want to see one of the last appearances of Oliver Hardy skip this one and watch Broadway Bill instead,negative
Jane Austens Emma is an extremely enjoyable story at the worst of times and this production of the story is the best I have ever seen Kake Beckinsales Emma is irreproachable Gwyneth Paltrow with the help of a good screenplay and excellent cinematography is able to bring out the comedy effectively she fails to make Emma likeable Paltrow is not aided by the fact that her hairstyles are simply wrong for the part and I believe the era and she looks positively ill in the empire line dresses Kate Beckinsale on the other hand manages the comedy effortlessly and is still able to show what Mr Knightly the most romantic of Jane Austens heroes actually sees in her Mark Strong is a splendid Mr Knightly with the right mix of handsome looks an appropriate age chivalry compassion and gentlemanly behaviour Emma and Mr Knightly are supported by a cast of good actors and the production as a whole is quite delightful,positive
Perhaps the best Isabel Allendes book House of the Spirits describes an alternative chilean history this one full of magic a mystic veil plus some kind of omnipresent sadness This movie gathers a great cast plus a great art direction with a script that cannot contain all this books quality Its unusual for a nearly unknown country like Chile to get so well represented as it is by this movie whose perhaps only sin is to aim too high and because of that left the illiterate public a little upset mostly because they understood very little,positive

Barriers seems to be one of those series that have been lost in the mists of time After its transmission in the early 80s and one repeat its since sunk without trace This is a crying shamebr br I originally watched this when it was transmitted in the Southern TV region on Sunday afternoons and was classic teatime viewing Although I dont remember a great deal about the program a few things stuck in my mind Most notable were the unforgettable titles The mournful flute music accompanying the attempted escape across an East European border and the subsequent car crash and that scene has left me with an abiding love of fintail Mercedes models as they used a Merc 200 Although it wasnt obvious at the start the solution to the series mystery was in these titlesbr br The plot about a young music student trying to unravel what really happened when he discovers he was adopted had lots of twists and turns but Barriers was a surprisingly adult childrens drama Benedict Taylor was excellent as Billy and it was a shame he didnt do a lot morebr br This was a quality drama well overdue for a DVD release and I hope Ill get the chance to reacquaint myself with it in the futurebr br A fond memory from my childhood,positive

Yes Kazaam is one of those horribly bad movies that almost reminds one of everything that is wrong with not just kids movies but with humanity Here we have Shaq as a rapping genie yes a RAPPING genie where he does everything from making bad puns to dressing in ridiculous outfits all ending in him in a Christlike pose with lots of light surrounding him So yeah expect really cheesy bits including the first wish being a lot of junk food falling down from the sky and regrettably not knocking out the two main characters particularly the kid What might not be expected is that a film with a kid and Shaquille ONeill would be so incredibly schmaltzy The main plot of the film involves this kid played in that alltootypical and annoyingkid fashion by the greatgrandson of Frank Capra where in which the kid is yelling out his dialog angrily who comes upon a genie whos been trapped in a boombox Then hiarity ensues as the kid makes the Shaqgenie his quasislave as he waits on his last two wishes as he tries to make amends with his shadygangtype absentee fatherbr br This really sappy contrived son and father story would be bad enough as there are certain lines that have been uttered in a million other movies ie the two chances in life speech from father to son But its Shaquille ONeill who is both the reason to watch the film ironically and the obvious sinking crux of it all His plot line involves him when not getting the overtalky treatment from Capra to rap within the dialog and also start off his blossoming recording career On top of this he also kicks ass and takes names with the main bad guys who want him back in the boombox So is there a camp factor to the movie Up to a point but this is even squashed by all of the mushy scenes and heartfelt moments that have really no business with the rest of the material One might ask if the people making the movie who were obviously doing it at the behest of the popularity of a BASKETBALL player who wanted to go on the Michael Jordan acting bandwagon if it would be anywhere near decently entertaining or convincing Id hope that they too knew they were just getting paid But Id hope even more that they felt at least a little guilty afterwords for feeding the Shaqmachinebr br So if you want to have a fun night of Shaq as genieturnedrapperturnedwisecracker all the more fun to you Hell it might even be interesting to have a Shaq movie night with this and his other critically acclaimed effort Steel But if youre hoping to keep a few brain cells stay away from what is very likely the worst flick of 1996 and a candidate among many others for worst of the 90s,negative
Simply the best Estonian film that I have ever seen although it is made by a Finnish director Ilkka JärviLaturi Tallin Pimeduses is an entertaining thriller about a bunch of gangsters who are trying to steal a huge amount of gold a national treasure that belongs to the republic of Estonia But at the same time it is some kind of a summary of the conditions of many Eastern European countries at that time In the early 90s Soviet Union fell into pieces and many countries such as Estonia became independent Now the conditions may be better in most of those countries But in the beginning of the 90s many of those new nations had to fight against corruption and organized crime that the Soviet era had left them as inheritance And many of them still doat least on some level br br Tallinn Pimeduses is a very realistic film of that era with believable characters and with a wellwritten script The actors are also very good especially Jüri Järvet perhaps the best known Estonian actor plays Snaut in Tarkovskis Solaris playing and old gangster whos slowly becoming tired of his way of life But the most astonishing performance comes from Monika Mäger a childactor playing Terje a boyish girl in her early teens whose presence in the plot is quite essential and her name is not even mentioned in the IMDbcredit listwbr br There are not many films in the world that manage to be entertainment and artistic at the same time But Tallinn Pimeduses does that Unfortenately JärviLaturis other films are far from this kind of achievements His first one Kotia päin was too artificial and his latest History is Made at Night was just a weird mess,positive
When you start watching this animationmasterpiece you quickly notice that its a European production Although the Europeans have sadly integrated some of the clichés you would normally find in an American production of this kind most are missing One of these is that there is an overwhelming evil that only our very few and very unlikely heroes can vanquish Another is that one of the group is only in the business for the money is greedy runs away when the heat is up but somehow gives in to his better nature This movie would have been better off without bothbr br The movie is based upon a TVSeries that was out four years before the movie Unlike the movie the TVSeries is a cartoon and not a computer animation At first I thought the computer would kill the charm and character of the plot but I was quickliy convinced Whoever did the animation knew his or her stuff Although the characters are obviously fictional in stills they dont even look real they seem as alive and sentient as the audience following their quest Making characters who by normal standards could be considered deformed those microlegs could never carry that giant body let alone make it jump so alive and lovable is more than just a highlight The creation of the world is another masterpiece Not so much because of its looks but because of the inventiveness of it The world our heroes travel is not solid like our own but is made of many pieces of land varying in shape and size that seem to be floating in mid air When a person steps on a smaller fragment of ground it nods a little bit as if feathering from the weight In some cases up and down no longer apply but our heroes still manage to get a foothold somewhere Although the world of floating islands is completely surreal in this movie it is absolutely believable and after a short time it doesnt seem any weirder than running into a car somewhere in New Yorkbr br I wrote that the looks of the world arent as breathtaking as the idea As true as that might be to my mind the quality of the world the characters and the attention to details is staggering Although the faces of the characters have relatively few attributes emotions can be read as clearly as in Sean Connerys or Dustin Hoffmans face The world around the characters is wonderfully colourful and no two settings are alike The background is always in motion something is always going on which makes the world seem even more alive If you stop the movie and look at the background you will be surprised how many details you can findbr br The existence of Hector actually puts the cherry on top Hector is a furry little thing possibly the equivalent of a dog in our world who is totally lovable and extremely funny Although he isnt really important for the main plot he would be missed like Scrat would be in Ice Age The really cool thing about Hector is that you need to speak Gibberish to understand himbr br If the movie is so great why didnt I give it 10 stars Well the plot in itself was rather thin Two hunters are sent out to rescue the world from a really bad dragon who wants to swallow the world isnt really original That in itself wouldnt be much of a problem What I missed was the background information What kind of a dragon was this and why did it look that way I love mythical stories but if they get too thin then they seem to be written after the movie is finished in a feeble attempt to give the whole thing some depthbr br Another thing I didnt like was Zoé Although a little girl like her could be considered adorable she was somewhat of a pain in this movie She seemed pretty resistant to all types of learning about reality kept dreaming of some hero from a story book and basically slowed the others down She would have been OK if she had developed a little more and a little earlier in the movie  or had been less of a girly to start with To me the idea of this girl who was there to twist the story a little backfired on the writersbr br All in all this is a really good movie for just about all ages,positive

This is the kind of film that I am wondering why anybody would have considered doing it from the beginning This is the kind of movie that I cannot understand how people put money in it how the rental store can put the DVD on its shelves This is the kind of movie I blame myself for having rented it br br There are good classB movies and I do not reject the genre When they are good they catch the interest with the action they have characters written well enough and acted well enough so that you can care about them The effects in some of these movies support the film in many cases and you may like them for the originality Almost nothing is true in Coronado The subject and the script is at the level of cheap comics  just a cliche The effects are cheap  and I do not care that the film is low budget  you can do a lot with low budget but you need some talent There are so many continuity and other directing errors as in ten other films You do not care for the characters you do not laugh and at the end of the film you are left wondering if the parody was intentional or not The only quality I could find is the scenery there are some good locations worth a much better film br br 210 on my personal scale The worst film of the year so far,negative
Im always surprised given that the famous title track of 2001 is called Also sprach Zarathustra that nobody nobody Ive read anyway has noted the parallels between the movie and Nietzsches famous work Also sprach Zarathustra The idea of mans rebirth into a star child an infant form of an indescribably more advanced being is an explicit part of Ns Zarathustra there is a prominent passage called On how a camel becomes a lion and a lion becomes a child in which N describes the first incarnation of the overman as a child transcending both the ascetic altruistic side of man the camel always asking to bear more weight and the rapacious brutish willtopower side of man the lion The fact that the song plays during the star child sequence can hardly be coincidence And also Zarathustra said that man is a rope tied between beasts and the overman The structure of the movie fits that description a brief history of man as beast until we become truly man by mastering weapons and acquiring reason then a long sequence about man the rope as it were and then a brief glimpse of the overman The inscrutability of how these transformations occurred and the suggestion that an external force caused them is also Nietzschean in Zarathustra he makes it pretty clear that he doesnt have a clue how people are going to be able to enact these changes themselves and suggests that we will have to depend on an outsider Zarathustra to show us how to go under Bowmans psychedelic sequence at the nearend could be seen as Kubricks best 1960sstyle attempt at depicting the mystical going underbr br I know these parallels are pretty broad and almost certainly have been noted elsewhere despite the fact that I have not personally seen it But I just wanted to mention them if for no other reason than to try to dispel the myth that Nietzsche was ultimately a gloomy philosopher Few people find the ending of 2001 to be gloomy and it is in my opinion explicitly and unmistakeably Nietzschean The case could certainly be made that 2001 is above all a dramatization of Zarathustra updated for the modern age Feel free to disregard the outright snobbishness of my tying everything to Nietzsche,positive
The movie is powerful as a political statement about extraordinary rendition torture and the politics of the war on terror Others have already commented on these and other aspects of the movie My review may contain spoilers so if you havent seen the movie you may not want to read beyond this pointbr br Several questions are raised by this movie First of all was the protagonist guilty or not There is no satisfying explanation for why the NSA decided to have him picked up and rendered in the first place Is there an innocent explanation for why he got phone calls from what the NSA thinks is a terrorist If there is the movie does not seem to give one and that made the whole movie quite unsatisfying to me It is all well and good to make statements about whether torture is right or wrong but first prove to me that they tortured the wrong person then we will take it to the next stepbr br If the protagonist was guilty then what was achieved by releasing him Perhaps we was welltrained to resist up to a certain point and then pretend to break down and give answers that can be proved wrong with a little research thus tending to lead the torturers to believe that they had tortured an innocent man into confessing without actually being guilty However there is nothing in the movie that proves he is guilty eitherbr br The various other loose ends out there are 1 So a rogue CIA agent has him released and flown back home What prevents the NSA from picking him up again A little publicity in the Washington Post Please give me a break here If a senator is not willing to put his neck on the line to intervene on his behalf what does Corinne Whitman have to fear 2 If the NSA has been tracking what phone numbers are being called by whom why couldnt they listen in on some of the calls to figure out whether anything underhanded is being discussed 3 The plot is even more stupid anyways Any criminal with more than a dozen brain cells would transact his criminal business on an anonymous prepaid cell phone line not on one that can be traced back to him and his housebr br The whole movie revolves around tugging at the viewers heart strings by showing graphic and gratuitous scenes of torture But when you think about it with any more depth there is nothing of substance in this movie only plenty of unanswered questions and the feeling of what that is it at the end of the movie,negative

A wonderful free flowing often lyrical film that whisks you along ever smiling even if there are truly shocking incidents along the way One gasps at the way the women are treated and yet ultimately they seem to come through very well and it is much credit to all concerned that so many potentially disastrous scenes all work so very well This is possibly Depardieus best performance certainly his most natural Jeanne Moreau performs outstandingly in what must have been a very difficult role to play and including vigorous sex scenes with a couple of guys at least half her age MiouMiou is lovely throughout and again has very difficult scenes to play Initially this seems a down and dirty misogynist rantromp but as the tale and characters unfold a much more tender and honest picture emerges In the end this uncompromising and daring film demands respect,positive

First of all Id like to tell you that Im into comics anime animation and such stuff It is true that everyone has his own preferences but you can trust me on this movie Ill be objective To begin with the story  its OK Follows the story line of the comic books as far as Im familiar with them But the animation Well its not actually terrible but its definitely cheap and mediocre It would be a lot better if they didnt try to imitate the anime style and sticked to the original comic book style drawings If we pretend not to see the rare sloppy effects like fire and lightnings you could tell that the movie is made about 10 years ago and even more Looks a little bit like the original Vampire Hunter D from 1985 Take a look at Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 for instance  4 years ago they made a movie that looks a hell lot better In addition to this the voice talents do nothing remarkable the music is nothing special So all in all  it lacks atmosphere I watched it but I cannot tell I really enjoyed it It just does not capture you Theres plenty of blood and violence but that does not impress me at all May be it will be shocking for someone who was never watched more mature oriented animations and sees animated blood for the first time is there anyone around but I dont think this is the audience for this movie So they could add a little nudity and spice to it The chicks around Lucifer were quite tasty and hell we have Lady Death herself There are few sexy looks but thats not enough Instead of Bill Browns music I think it would look better on a hard rock  heavy metal soundtrack All in all  the movie isnt that bad but if you want something better take the original Heavy Metal Heavy Metal FAKK 2000 Ralph Bakshis Fire and Ice or Wizards maybe And of course  Vampire Hunter D Bloodlust,negative
Still love it 17 or so years after the first time I saw it in fact I discovered that I had lost my copy of this and was very upset Despite its nonassociation with the original which as a kid I never noticed and as an adult I dont care about this is what cartoons should be like Just dark enough to be interesting and light enough to be enjoyed by everyone Im more than glad that my parents raised me on this kind of thing rather than the cartoons we see today that teach our kids nothing The music is great and gets stuck in your head foreverI have downloaded the entire soundtrack at one point or another,positive
After watching The Bodyguard last night I felt compelled to write a review of itbr br This could have been a pretty decent movie had it not been for the awful camerawork It was beyond annoying The angles were all wrong it was impossible to see anything especially during the fight sequences The closeups were even horriblebr br The story has Sonny Chiba hiring himself out as a bodyguard to anyone willing to lead him to the top of a drug ring He is approached by Judy Lee who is never quite straight with Chiba Lees involvement in the drug ring is deeper than Chiba thought as the Mob and another gang of thugs are after herbr br The story was decent and despite horrible dubbing this could have been a good movie Given better direction and editing Im sure this would have been a classic Kung Foo movie As it is its more like another cheesy 70s action moviebr br Note The opening sequence has a quote familiar to Pulp Fiction fans and then continues to a karate school in Times Square that is in no way related to the rest of the moviebr br Rating 4 out of 10,negative
Bill Buddy Rogers is sent to New York by his uncle Richard Tucker to experience life before he inherits 25million His uncle has paid 3 women Jacqui Kathryn Crawford Maxine Josephine Dunn and Pauline Carole Lombard to chaperone him and ensure that he does not fall foul of golddiggers One such lady Cleo Geneva Mitchell turns up on the scene to the disapprovement of the women We follow the tale as the girls are offered more money to appear in a show instead of their escorting role that they have agreed to carry out for the 3 months that Bill is in New York while Bill meets with Cleo and another woman At the end love is in the air for Bill and one other br br The picture quality and sound quality are poor in this film The story is interspersed with musical numbers but the songs are bad and Kathryn Crawford has a terrible voice Rogers isnt that good either Hes pleasant enough but only really comes to life when playing the drums or trombone There is a very irritating character who plays a cab driver Roscoe Karns and the film is just dull,negative
The only reason I give this movie 810 stars and not 10 is because 1 Sinatra is awful and 2 the love interest of Kellys character leaves much to be desired IMHO Do love that Dean Stockwell Quantum Leap  Al is the little boy The dance sequence with Jerry Mouse is one of the most entertaining and amazing dance sequences I have ever seen Tom and Jerry is still a personal favorite of mine and my daughters Im 28 and shes 4 so while the character is less iconic than Mickey he is still a favorite of many children and adults today Kelly is as always captivating his eyes full of fun and excitement In every movie I have ever seen him in he always steals the show One of the best dancers of the 20th century It is no wonder Paula Abdul sampled Kellys moves I would also list Gene Kelly as one of the most beautiful people of the 20th century If you were to watch only one part dont miss Kellys dance with Jerry Mouse You will NOT be disappointed,positive

Ive seen nurse betty twice in september 2000 on the international film festival films by the sea in vlissingen the netherlands It impressed me so much that I kept on smiling the whole day after I watched it for the first time and almost all evening again when I took the movie as the final taste of the festival What I knew about nurse betty was in short that renée zellweger would play a girl in love with a soapoperastar But what I saw was much more than that Splendid roles for morgan freeman chris rock ànd renée zellweger A strange mix of romance violence and roadmovie And for all a story that takes other directions every moment you think youre on the track Many soapoperalovers will love nurse betty  the movie as well as the character  but they can bring all there nonsoap friends cause they will enjoy the story even more for the hard and humorous lines  freeman and rock  for the cruel scenes the thrilleraspects and for the beautiful pictures And Im quite sure that at the end everyone will love nurse betty for her captivating and innocent charm,positive

I will never go to another Tarantino movie again The entire film was worthless My wife and I both regret that we didnt get up and walk out at the first indication of what the film was really going to be about which is still hard to determine since it was such a ridiculous storylineblood guts and violence seemed to be the only real theme but we kept hoping thered be something redeeming just around the corner Unfortunately there wasnt because there wasnt anything that made sense We along with a lot of the other people in the audience walked out of the theater muttering that was disgusting what a waste of time I shouldve walked out where was the comedy that was pathetic etc It actually made us the audience voice our disgust and the feeling that we had just been thoroughly ripped off The only thing of merit in the film was the costuming and the acting ability of almost everyone in the filmthere just wasnt a plotscript worthy of their talents I rate this a 1 because there isnt a 0 I cant quite understand how anyone could rate this higher than a 0,negative
The movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weakimplausible story line miscasting and general lack of contentsubstance One of the very obvious flaws was that Sean Connery who played an Arab man didnt know how to pronounce his own Arab name This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details The quality of acting was uniformly well below average br br Movies solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song I dont recall the title Overall it was a pretty bad movie where Sean Connery was visibly miscast,negative

YesA real stinker I saw this movie on the advice of my sweet friends who told me that this is a great psychological movie This film makes every effort not to be understandable I was aware that I was in for a stinker after seeing the first 20 minutesI waited since I expected to see something valuable and most important of all I PAID for this film The wait was unbearable After seeing the film I talked with my friends and learned that in the intellectual environments  They call themselves under this title  of Turkey this movie had recognised as a masterpiece Yes a masterpiece but in the category of stinkersI think that a movie must be selfexplanatory This film is just the opposite Keep away from this thing which calls itself a movie Burn your money instead of paying for this phenomenon Rate 1 out of 10,negative

Going into this movie I had heard good things about it Coming out of it I wasnt really amazed nor disappointed Simon Pegg plays a rather childish character much like his other movies There were a couple of laughs here and there nothing too funny Probably my favorite parts of the movie is when he dances in the club scene I totally gotta try that out next time I find myself in a club A couple of stars here and there including Megan Fox Kirsten Dunst that chick from XFiles and Jeff Bridges I found it quite amusing to see a cameo appearance of Thandie Newton in a scene She of course being in a previous movie with Simon Pegg Run Fatboy Run I see it as a toss up youll either enjoy it to an extent or find it a little dull I might add Kirsten Dunst is adorable in this movie 3,positive
badly directed garbage a mediocre nihilist sadistic gorefest  if you are the sort of person who likes that  see a shrink even if you are that person it doesnt make this a good film the acting is really poor the story full of plot holes the director really should just give up and find a real job as he has no talent for this one I can see why people dislike uwe boll  we have had a few of his films on lately and this is the best of them which is really sad A complete absence of any sort of humanity seems to suit some people but here it just grates Horror films can be full of desolation they can be miniature works of art they can be just good viewing when there is nothing else on  SEED is just really really poor,negative

Cheers to all the wonderful fans of this film that have not only seen and appreciate it but based on the many literate comments actually GET IT I for one have always considered Paul Mazurskys Tempest a musing on the Shakespeare play of the same name as has been noted in a few of the other reviews here On the other hand if youre looking for a more straightforward adaptation of the play you should look elsewhere As an experiment however it succeeds just spectacularly Charming moving funny sad dramatic  its all of that and much more Cast locations script music are just fantastic Cassavetes and Rowland were never better Susan Sarandons turn more than hinted at the great work to come from her in the future Molly Ringwald makes her film debut memorable and you just have to love Raul Julias performance  he steals the show in several scenes Whats more the always great Cassavetes was confident and assured enough a performer to have let him A study on what the thematic elements of Shakespeares classic might be life if updated into more modern times Mazurskys Tempest burns brilliantly,positive

I didnt think it could be done but something has come along and replaced Open House a low budget horror about someone killing over the high price of real estate as the worst film Ive ever seen in my short but otherwise sweet lifebr br It was touted as the best film in Montreals most recent film festival which leads me to believe that every other entry must consist of blankwall shots accompanied by people reading gloomy poetrybr br Watching this movie was like a little slice of Hell Its from Austria and it attempts to stumble along in the footsteps of Short Cuts and Blue Velvet scenes about various characters living in a suburban area with a dark underbelly Theres the fat dog owner and his fat maid wife who stripteases for him the skinny divorcee whose wife still lives with him in a house that includes the untouched room of his dead child the überannoying woman hitchhiker who recites top ten lists The list goes on Forever Much like the two hours plus I spent in that theatrebr br Yes the characters interact but not in a clever or interesting or even relevant way I couldnt say if they were any good as actors as according to the subtitles they were given lines that were the Austrian equivalent of You are so lame They certainly didnt have to learn many as each repeated his or her same lines at least three times in a scenebr br This is no Gummo or any of the aforementioned movies There is no art to discover and nothing to dwell on afterwards except maybe whether or not you should change your never walk out during a movie policy which quite a few older couples did during a random orgy scene and if that sounds appetizing its not unless youre one of few who doesnt find the idea of your parents having sex and with a few local middleaged couples to boot revoltingbr br This movie was offensive to me Not the flabby nudity not the cringeinducing soundtrack not the shockless scenes involving guns I was offended that someone actually spent money to make this when there are capable writers and filmmakers out there looking for funding I was offended that someone from out of town might have gone to see Dog Days and come out wondering if that was the best us Montrealers could find Most of all I was offended that somehow the people involved with the festival duped everyone into believing that the emperor had a gorgeous and mesmerising new outfit when it was painfully clear that he was as naked as the fat maid wife doing a stripteasebr br ,negative
Consider for a moment what it must be like to be Uwe Boll Somewhere perhaps in those places that Jack Nicholson said you dont talk about at parties Boll knows that David Lean had head lice as a child that had more talent for film making than him Gore Whores metalheads and the socially dysfunctional may bump into him on the circuit and tell him otherwise but general audiences find the Teutonic helmsmans output so bereft of originality wit or imagination that hes become the internets bogeyman  an online discursive synonym for photochemical excrement Boll does his best to ride over these naysayers exploiting tax credits available in Germany and Canada to keep working and raising money from a network of dentists as Zero Mostel did with old ladies in The Producers The difference being that Mostels character knew he was making bowel fill Maybe Uwe knows it toobr br Such is the level of hostility toward each new Bollbuster that IMDb patrons sabotage their ratings by voting 1 before theyve seen it Bolls attempts at silencing his critics by challenging them to a boxing match and knocking them out just made them more determined Indeed hes probably the only filmmaker thats boosted thesaurus sales as critics search for inventive ways of describing garbagebr br This onslaught has made Uwe a very thick skinned man so much so that he must feel like hes wrapped in a carpet but one who feels as if hes bullied by the entire world Like most people in that situation he lashes out determined to upset as many people as possible with the memory of a tearful evening holding Varietys review of House of the Dead never too far from the surface This I know you are but what am I strategy for reclaiming the initiative produced the blunt satire of Postal which attempted to napalm the dissenters with jokes about 911 Christian fundamentalism Jihad Nazism and paedophilia Such a litany of invective requires a satirist with the mind of Peter Cook and the visual imagination of Chris Morris but the closest Boll gets to either man is the o in their surnamebr br In Seed shot back to back with the aforementioned game adaptation Boll is back with a story about a sadistic serial murderer is there any other kind who gets the chair only for two attempts to fail in permanently curtailing all signs of life Mindful of the fictional law that says anyone still alive after 3 attempts must go free though if youd been fried with that much electricity why would you want to they pronounce him legally dead and bury him only for the disgruntled killer to resurface and begin a whirlwind tour of his gaolersbr br Boll begins his exploration of nihilistic rage with Seed watching footage of animals being tortured for experimental purposes From there were treated to the killers stock in trade  kidnapping dogs babies and grown women and allowing them to starve to death on camera only to become maggot food Were invited to reflect on what a depraved race of amoral meat sacks we all are  our inhumanity to each other and our fellow creatures acting as a lighting rod that acts as a catalyst for the most disgusting vestiges of the human condition Yes were worthless gormless sadists and worse than that we wont give Uwe a good rating on the IMDb In short humanity is bunkbr br Of course you might think that Uwe relies on our worst excesses for his livelihood and with that in mind its a bit of a bipolar piece on one hand hating its audience and positively basting itself in the sour milk of human kindness  the milk that poor old Boll has had to drink for so long while simultaneously whipping out its member and inviting those with a pornographic lust for on screen depravity to marvel at its sheer arse splitting girthbr br The result says nothing about society and its discontents more the corrosive effect bad press is having on its director Poor Uwe is obviously a very angry man  one scene in which a poor woman gets her brains hammered to a pulp while tied to a chair no doubt a surrogate for his own fantasys about dispatching various web critics That its there but takes an avantgarde approach by failing to be attached to any kind of narrative thread shows that Boll is a pornographer whose happy to engage with the blood lust of his audience and knows that plot is surplus to requirements Hes made a film which is competently shot but utterly desolate I wanted to make a horror movie that was no fun Boll told the audience at the films world premiere and he has on that flimsy manifesto succeeded but if this was supposed to convince the directors detractors that he was a serious genre filmmaker hell need something genuine to say as well as a better more original way of saying it,negative
This movie blows  lets get that straight right now There are a few scene gems nestled inside this pile of crap but none can redeem the limp plot Colin Farrel looks like Brad Pitt in 12 Monkeys and acts in a similar manner I normally hate Colin because he is a fairy in general but hes OK in this movie There were two plot lines in this movie one about a kid who throws rocks through windshields of moving vehicles and the other about a woman with a moustache Lets face it this movie has no freaking idea of what it wanted to say or where it wanted to go THe characters story lines intertwine on some levels but are in no means worthy of being included in a script The whole thing is weak and pointless and then there is an occasional OK scene But overall Dont bother unless you love irish accents so much that you can watch mediocrity and it is rescued by everyone sounding like the Lucky Charms elf an American fetish that has catapulted some truly crappy movies to success,negative

Ok where to start I cant believe how many good reviews I read on here I watched this year 2004 and I had to fight to not push the stop button I decided to continue just because of all the good reviews I read After watching it I felt it was my duty to let the world know about this First of all the movie seems like it is never going to begin the plotline doesnt actually occur until about 30 minutes before the movie ends leaving the viewer wondering when is this going to start So dont ever call this a revenge movie because the revenge doesnt even start until over half the movie is already gone by Furthermore the movie tries to make you believe this is a postapocalyptic Australia I am sorry if showing dusty rural roads half the movie and a crooked letter on a sign didnt quite convince me of that even for 1979 this was not science fiction So anyways add this on top of randomly placed homoerotic subtext and you have got yourself one crappy movie I have nothing against gays there was just no need for it The only good part was the first chase scene good directing considering it was 1979 and another good part is how he kills the last guy So basically I recommend you watch the first 10 minutes and last 5 minutes and you will enjoy yourself much more than if you sat through all that stuff in the middle which may lead you to gouge your own eyes out Dont say I didnt warn you,negative

Last night I saw A PECK ON THE CHEEK KANNATHIL MUTHAMITTAL with English subtitles Oddly it was 137 minutes longslightly longer than the time listed on IMDbbr br At first I found myself losing interest in this film because the rather confusing style of filming really lost me The context for what was occurring was missing and I am glad I stuck with it At the beginning a young couple is married and shortly after the wedding war breaks out in their native Sri Lanka and the lovers are separated Months later the wife is very pregnant and on board a refugee vessel heading to India At a refugee center you see the lady about to give birthafter which the titles to the film finally are revealedbr br The entire focus of the film then changes completelyto a young girl who is about to turn 9 in Madras India You see her in her home and she talks to the camera about her life and family None of this seems that interesting or important and you wonder what is missingwhat about the lady who was about to give birth My wife and I debated this and we finally guessed that this little girl was actually the child of the lady in the first part of the film Somehow or another she had been adopted and was talking about her life with mom and dad 2though she did NOT realize these people were not her biological parentsbr br Soon after this the parents revealed themselves to be total idiots one of the complaints I had about the film as they decided to tell this very young girl the truth about her parentage AND tell it in a way that left the girl emotionally screwed up and confused Despite a stupid decision and telling her in the worst way the parents made up for this by agreeing to help her find her biological mother Seeing the impact all this had on the girl and parents particularly the adoptive mother was impressive to watch and sure sparked my interestbr br Unfortunately Sri Lanka has been involved in a very very long and brutal civil war with Tamilese militants off and on for three decades The familys decision to look for the mom back in Sri Lanka was indeed noble but also a bit stupid at timesas they took so many risks and nearly got killed again and again by just blindly jumping into the middle of a war This was all exciting and captivating but also left me wondering about the sanity of the adoptive parentsfirst you tell her she ISNT your biological child and now you take her in the middle of a WAR ZONE Sure the kid really wanted to meet her biological mother but this really was stupid in hind sight If it were me I might have been tempted to pay an unemployed actress to play the part and fool the kidthus avoiding being in the middle of a warbr br Despite my complaints the film was lovely to watch and was very rewarding Far from perfect it sure hits an emotional home run Also while I expected this because I have seen several Indian films many Westerners will be a bit surprised by the vivid songs that seem to come out of no wherethis IS standard in most films from Indiaincluding those made in Bollywood Bombay and TamilwoodKollywood Madras,positive
I thought that ROTJ was clearly the best out of the three Star Wars movies I find it surprising that ROTJ is considered the weakest installment in the Trilogy by many who have voted To me it seemed like ROTJ was the best because it had the most profound plot the most suspense surprises most emotionalespecially the ending and definitely the most episodic movie I personally like the Empire Strikes Back a lot also but I think it is slightly less good than than ROTJ since it was slowermoving was not as episodic and I just did not feel as much suspense or emotion as I did with the third moviebr br It also seems like to me that after reading these surprising reviews that the reasons people cited for ROTJ being an inferior film to the other two are just plain ludicrous and are insignificant reasons compared to the sheer excellence of the film as a whole I have heard many strange reasons such as a Because Yoda died b Because Bobba Fett died c Because small Ewoks defeated a band of stormtroopers d Because Darth Vader was revealedbr br I would like to debunk each of these reasons because I believe that they miss the point completely First off WHO CARES if Bobba Fett died If George Lucas wanted him to die then he wanted him to die Dont get me wrong I am fan of Bobba Fett but he made a few cameo appearances and it was not Lucas intention to make him a central character in the films that Star Wars fans made him out to be His name was not even mentioned anywhere in the movie You had to go to the credits to find out Bobba Fetts name Judging ROTJ because a minor character died is a bit much I think Secondly many fans did not like Yoda dying Sure it was a momentous period in the movie I was not happy to see him die either but it makes the movie more realistic All the good guys cant stay alive in a realistic movie you know Otherwise if ALL the good guys lived and ALL the bad guys died this movie would have been tantamount to a cheesy Saturday morning cartoon Another aspect to this point about people not liking Yodas death Well nobody complained when Darth Vader struck down Obi Wan Kenobi in A New Hope Many consider A New Hope to be the best of the Trilogy Why was Obi Wans death okay but Yodas not hmmmmmmmmmmmm Another reason I just can not believe was even stated was because people found cute Ewoks overpowering stormtroopers to be impossible That is utterly ridiculous I can not believe this one First off the Ewoks are in their native planet Endor so they are cognizant of their home terrain since they live there If you watch the movie carefully many of the tactics the Ewoks used in defeating the stormtroopers was through excellent use of their home field advantage Since you lived in the forest all your life I hope you would have learned to use it to your advantage They had swinging vines ropes logs set up to trip those walkers and other traps The stormtroopers were highly disadvantaged because they were outnumbered and not aware of the advantages of the forest The only thing they had was their blasters To add it was not like the Ewoks were battling the stormtroopers themselves they were heavily assisted by the band of rebels in that conquest I thought that if the stormtroopers were to have defeated a combination of the Star Wars heros the band of rebels as well as the huge clan of Ewoks with great familiarity of their home terrain that would have been a great upset Lastly if this scene was still unbelievable to you How about in Empire Strikes Back or in A New Hope where there were SEVERAL scenes of a group consisting of just Han Solo Chewbacca and the Princess being shot at by like ten stormtroopers and all their blasters missed while the heros were in full view And not only that the heroes  of course always hit the Stormtroopers with their blasters The troopers must have VERY VERY bad aim then At least in Empire Strikes Back the Battle of Endor was much more believable since you had two armies pitted each other not 3 heroes against a legion of stormtroopers Dont believe me Check out the battle at Cloud City when our heroes were escaping Landos base Or when our heros were rescuing Princess Leia and being shot at somehow they missedas Han Solo and Luke were trying to exit the Death Starbr br The last reason that I care to discuss others are just too plain ridiculous for me to spend my time here is that people did not like Darth Vader being revealed Well in many ways that was a major part of the plot in the movie Luke was trying to find whether or not Darth Vader was his father Annakin Skywalker It would have been disappointing if the movie had ended without Luke getting to see his fathers face because it made it complete By Annakins revelation it symbolized the transition Darth Vader underwent from being possessed by the dark side in his helmet and to the good person he was Annakin Skywalker by removing the helmet The point is that Annakin died converted to the light side again and that is what the meaning of the helmet removal scene was about In fact thats is what I would have done in that scene too if I were Lukes fatherIsnt that what you would have done if you wanted to see your son with your own eyes before you died and not in a mechanized helmetbr br On another note I think a subconscious or conscious expectation among most people is that the sequel MUST be worse even if it is better that preceding movies is another reason that ROTJ does not get as many accolades as it deserves I never go into a film with that deception in mind I always try to go into a film with the attitude that Well it might be better or worse that the original  But I can not know for sure Lets see That way I go with an open mind and do not dupe myself into thinking that a clearly superior film is not as good as it really wasbr br I am not sure who criticizes these movies but I have asked many college students and adults about which is their favorite Star Wars movie and they all tell me except for one person that said that A New Hope was their favorite that it is ROTJ I believe that the results on these polls are appalling and quite misleadingbr br Bottom line the Return of the Jedi was the best of the Trilogy This movie was the only one of the three that kept me riveted all throughout its 135 minutes There was not a moment of boredom because each scene was either suspenseful exciting surprising or all of the above For example the emotional light saber battle between Luke and his father in ROTJ was better than the one in the Empire Strikes Back any daybr br Finally I hope people go see the Phantom Menace with an open mind because if fans start looking for nitpicky insignificant details or see it as just another sequel to trash the movie such as This movie stinks because Luke is not in it then this meritorious film will become another spectacular movie that will be the subject of derision like ROTJ suffered unfortunatelybr br ,positive

After reading the book which had a lot of meaning for me the movie didnt give me any of the feeling which the book conveyed This makes me wonder if Kaufman even liked this book for he successfully made it into something elseEither that or he is simply bad Most importantly where is the lightness From the very first scene music drownes out most of the dialogue and feeling and this continues right through the movie I think the makers thought that by having upbeat music playing right through the movie this would make the story feel light however they have completely failed here Instead the music manages to give everything that movie feel in a way dramatising events so that we linger on them so that everything actually feels heavybr br Another example of the how this adaptation fails is by embellishing the story line making it more dramatic In the movie we see Franz passing Tomas on the street who is on his way to see Sabina The introduction of this chance meetingpassing which im sure didnt happen in the book gives Tomas story more significance than it does make it lightbr br There are many other examples where the continuity of the story has been changed imo for the worst however this might have been done because the book simply doesnt convert well into a movie such is Kunderas style This makes we wonder if all the generous reviewers on this site were writing with their book AND movie experience in mind rather than writing about just the film A film which is as long as it is uncompelling For those who havent read the book yet I recommend just reading that For those who have I have to say you will just be wasting your time and probably end up here writing similar stayclear warnings,negative
I can remember seeing this movie as a kid in 1977 or 1978 HBO would show it late at night back when they were they one and only movie pay channel in existence Back then it was UNRATED and was the only movie of its kind ever shown on pay televisionespecially back then I would love to see it now as an adult where I would be more apt to understand the adult theme of it It was probably the closest thing I had ever seen to pornography at the young age of 7 or 8 Luckily I had stupid babysitters and partygoing parents on the weekends Most of my memory of this movie was the completely erratic sexual behavior of these two guys Breaking into houses to sniff underwear feeding on a strangers breast milk on a public bus and fornicating in a cab at the request of one of their female subjects were just a few of the whacked escapades these guys were pulling off A very racy film for the early 70s Until I checked IMDb I had no idea this movie had such a following Most people I talk to have never heard of it,positive
what a waste of a film once again the film industry does not trust to make a film that could have been just about the mans ideas there is virtually nothing on his theories or evolution instead the most boring story of home life and relationship with one daughter a ponderous script great liberties taken with Darwins life dialogue given to his character that i find hard to believe he would have voiced Darwin never gave up his believe in a higher power he may not quite rightly have believed in the established Christian idea of God  but was not an atheist which this film implies what would have been a riveting and much better film is if they had started with the publication of On the Origin of Species and constructed a story of the great revolution that entailed and of an amazing cast of characters involved on all sides instead we got a plodding boring drama mostly made up a great injustice,negative
i happen to love this show Its a refreshing take on some older scifi feels and styles they arent afraid to shoot and when they do people tend to die Far too many shows are afraid of this and end up just pointing the guns and then having it be a standoff Farscape also comes complete with a large amount of heartwarming characters They all grow on you till the point where it confuses you to hear them discuss taking some of the animatronic ones out of their boxs to make the miniseries From beginning to end farscape leaves you with a feeling of hope and dispair as new and unexpected things happen and then people live and die surprising you every time Worth a watch even if you dont have the time,positive
A girl begins to notice that people in her small town are becoming fascinated by anything that is shaped like a spiral Soon the fascination turns to obsession and things get deadly While I wont say that Uzumaki was an excellent film I will say that it was unlike anything Ive seen before Throughout my viewing I felt like I was watching a cartoon There are funny segues between scenes and characters with digitally enhanced eyes Later I found out the film is an adaptation of a manga comic so this makes sense However just when you think you are watching something that could be a kids movie you are bombarded with nasty and gory visuals The story often lags and the ending is somewhat abrupt and seemed anticlimactic at the time but in retrospect I appreciate it more for its originality My Rating 710,positive
In  Out is a comedy with a simple premise It admirably succeeds in the mission of being funny and entertainingbr br The comedy in this film ranges from the ridiculous to the sublime physical comedy exists alongside dry humor with a nice veteran turn by Bob Newhart Kevin Kline is predictably in excellent form in this film alongside Tom Selleck not playing to his expected square jawed leading man type Mr Selleck plays his humor well and displays a nice sense of comedic timing The cast makes this film successfulbr br Not all films with homosexual themes are made to advance some sort of sinister hidden Hollywood liberal agenda in point of fact this film was simply made to entertain and if any part of this films makes the viewer think then it was a byproduct of the wellacted work by a terrific cast of professionals Frequently tongueincheek I found myself laughing at the right moments A solid B,positive
I wrote spoiler alert but theres not really much that can be spoiled Its like spoiling rotten meat This movie is probably the worst Ive ever seen Not because of the actors or the special effects but because of the sheer number of mistakes both factual and physical First of all the MIGs arent actually MIGs at all Theyre Mirages and theyre French And how the heck can Dougs dad withstand the maneuvers his son makes to fight off the MIGs without a gsuit And why would Chappy try to board his plane without a gsuit And how could Doug defeat the enemy pilot ace with such ease Anyway I did not like this movie And the worst part is that it has 3 sequels the latest one from as late as 1995 Now thats scary,negative
This is a below average whodunit with the cliche everyone in the living room routine Charlie Chan is a Secret Service Agent doing government work and he must find who killed a scientist working on a bomb to defeat German Uboats in World War Two There is little to recommend with this movie since the neither the bomb nor the scientist nor the war have much to do with the plot Charlie Chan fans will most likely find this movie disappointing Who dunit Who cares,negative
I was young film student in 1979 when the Union of the Soviet Filmmakers came to Sofia Bulgaria and premiered Konchalovskys Siberiade Tarkosvkys Stalker and Daneliaa Autumn marathon I was stunned by the cosmopolitan dimension of the art form Then and only then I saw Siberiade 4 and 12 hours epic and was speechless Way better then Bertoluccis 1900 By farbr br Hope Andron will somehow get to the negative and make directors restored version full lenght  someday On DVD of course Also I fiercely fought in defense of this Cinema against most of my colleagues who were equating Soviet film with bad taste Time is on my side,positive
I have to say although this movie was formulaic throughout with a plot stolen from films like Friday the 13thI Know What You Did Last Summer this movie wasnt that bad In fact it wasnt as bad as most of the Horror films Hollywood has released recently The killings although at times a little too imaginative were in most instances just that original The cast was mediocre which is to be expected from lowbudget features but much better than what that much bigger studio ArtisanLions Gate has been offering My only real complaint that wasnt due to the films budget which must have been small was the contrived twist ending Im sorry but this is what put this film in the bad category for me The ending was just stupid and tacked on Before that I was a little bored but actually enjoying it 410,negative
Before there was Crash there was this interesting film called Grand Canyon Released about 14 years sooner than the former film Grand Canyon was a movie about two people from different backgrounds who come together as friends over a lifetime To me Crash was still a slightly better film but Grand Canyon was no slouch eitherbr br Taking place in Los Angeles an upperclass lawyer named Mack Kevin Kline takes a shortcut through the seedier side of town only to have his car break down at the worst time He calls for a tow truck and has to wait for awhile only to soon be threatened by a group of dangerous people who want his car Soon the tow truck driver arrives at the perfect moment and out steps Simon Danny Glover to take the truck away Both men are threatened but Simon manages to get himself Mack and the car out of dire straits It is from here on out that a friendship develops between the two men over a lifetime with Mack helping out Simon just as Simon had helped him out of a dangerous situation earlier You see Simons sister Deborah Tina Lifford is living in a dangerous neighborhood with her two children and fears for her oldest son who seems to be roaming the streets at night with some bad people Mack offers them a better place to live as well as hooking Simon up with his secretarys friend Jane Alfre Woodardbr br This is the main plot of the film but there are other smaller plots involving the same secretary mentioned above Mary Louise Parker as well as Macks wife Mary McDonnel who discovers an abandoned baby not long after their son Roberto Jeremy Sisto in his first movie role has gone to camp for the summer and will likely be moving on with his own life soon The details of all these plots are brought together into one complex movie which uses a police helicopter as a metaphor for life and as a bridge to entwine all the different scenes This simple plot device works very well and helps greatly with the flow of the storybr br The director Lawrence Kasdan whose biggest movie to this date was The Big Chill has created a splendid movie here The cast is excellent and most of the ideas are well thought out but alas it falls short of greatness because some points that wouldve made the film even stronger are glossed over The story involving the secretary is one and the second involving Simons nephew is the other These scenes shouldve been more apart of the entire story and then maybe Lawrence Kasdans views of life between the upper and lower classes wouldve been more on a superior level instead of just very good Still Grand Canyon exceeded expectations and yes you will get to see a view of the canyon that this movie was named after There is also a small role for Steve Martin as Davis a producer of violent films who offers his own views on life and has a small part to play in this movies ideas,positive

I guess I only have myself to blame for the gigantic disillusion that is Entrails of a Virgin You already know not to expect a cinematic masterpiece when you see a juicy and proudly promoted title like this and the first impression only gets extra confirmed when noticing the film is a mid80s production from Japan Now there are quite a lot of demented and sick filmmakers active in Japan but Kazuo Komizu surpasses them all with his thoroughly depraved and sickening trilogy revolving on nothing but aggressive sex and the sadistic abuse of young girls Not even attempting to tell a story Entrails of a Virgin simply presents a hodgepodge of UNarousing semipornographic sex and truly poor goreeffects that wouldnt even please the most undemanding fan of cheesy 80s horror Images of a bunch of photographers and their fashion models are inexplicably intercut with scenes of a filthy pervert having crude sex with a seemly underaged girl He dumps her not even a minute after climaxing typical and she begs him to stay even if she has to share him with other women I dont get it Is this supposed to represent a general male fantasy Because its really clichéd and wrongful Anyways back to the bunch of horny photographers and docile models Surprised by upcoming fog on their way home the group entrenches themselves in an abandoned country house where they have more appalling sex and eventually fall victim to a ridiculous sexdemon who kills them all The acting performances are amateurish the dialogs inane and primitive and Komizus direction is weak and uninspired I can tolerate all that including the womanunfriendly portrayal of sex but I came too close to turning the film off during the indescribably meanspirited wrestling sequence One of the males brutally hits kicks and throws around one of the girls and calls her a filthy whore until she literally pees her panties and cries with agony This sequence is in my humble opinion the absolute lowpoint of Asian exploitation cinema One to avoid and maybe even boycott,negative
Sorry everyone I know this is supposed to be an art film but wow they should have handed out guns at the screening so people could blow their brains out and not watch Although the scene design and photographic direction was excellent this story is too painful to watch The absence of a sound track was brutal The loooonnnnng shots were too long How long can you watch two people just sitting there and talking Especially when the dialogue is two people complaining I really had a hard time just getting through this film The performances were excellent but how much of that dark sombre uninspired stuff can you take The only thing i liked was Maureen Stapleton and her red dress and dancing scene Otherwise this was a ripoff of Bergman And im no fan f his either I think anyone who says they enjoyed 1 12 hours of this is well lying,negative
This movie is a riot I cannot remember the last time I had such a great time at the movies Ive seen a few good comedies in my time and usually they are pretty funny But this one is wall to wall great lines I think Best in Show is the last movie that I laughed so hard and so much in The movie was nonstop until the end when they did the 5 minutes of sentimental plot clean up Other than that its a constant barrage of one liners and goofy situations Id like to see it again before it leaves the theater because this is like the Zucker movies where you dont get all the jokes the first time around You have to see it two or three times to get it all inbr br As far as the actual film goes it could have used a better edit its choppy at times but we have to be forgiving for that All the characters are great Its not like an Adam Sandler movie where he tries to be funny and everyone else suffers around him and is the butt of the joke I think I will remember all the main characters for years to come because they are all so likable No victims in this movie Also thank God they got a 45 year old actress to play his girlfriend Catherine Keener plays her and she is a sweetheart in this film You just wish that women like her really existed Shes not a 10 like some of the other leading ladies but somehow her smile is warmer than Julia Roberts overdone overbitebr br If you see the trailer for this film you may not think too highly of it I assure you the trailer does not do it justice They do not give away all the good jokes Just some of the mediocre onesbr br Oh and one more thing I hope critics put this on their top ten list Many of them complain that comedies dont get the recognition they deserve and then at the end of the year they dont put it on their list This means you Ebert,positive
I had recently been watching Johnny Test in an attempt to find humor in it I failed horribly Cartoon Network usually has a tendency to make their shows enjoyable by all audiences but Johnny Test is entertainment in its lowest form The writing is incredibly predictable and the running gags arent much gags at all Kids will love it and thats about itbr br Now this isnt to say that its all bad The original opening theme was actually pretty catchy but for some reason they took the skeleton of it and figuratively smashed it with a figurative aluminum bat Its a shame because that was really one of the best things it had going for itbr br Some of the characters could be very interesting in theory With a little work the characters could work well together but theyre too onedimensional Then again this makes it easy for the kids to follow br br The pace is a bit too fast as well The episodes are too busy leaving little time for clever writing This is a real shame because there are so many interesting concepts that the show brings forth On the upside however the fast pace will stop the kids from losing interest and thats really the entirety of the target audiencebr br Overall the show looks very good on paper but just doesnt succeed in being funny or interesting This is a show I want to like but Im incapable of it Theres just so much potential that isnt realized Kids will enjoy it but thats about it,negative

Ive now seen this film twice and I must say I enjoyed it both times Its fast paced and fun but ultimately daft Having said that it deserves to be trashed because of screwing up what could have been a good follow up to the seminal original It is clear for those who have seen the awful Zombie Creeping Flesh that the films massive shortcomings can be owed to Bruno Mattei and that the little that is commendable about it can be owed to Fulci This is not idle Fulci sycophancy the directors styles are starkly contrasted throughout and you can tell who directed what particularly in Matteis casebr br The film is centered around the outbreak of a virus oddly referred to as top secret by a scientist its secrecy apparently being more noteworthy than its potentially apocalyptic effect on mankind somewhere in south east Asia The virus causes zombie like behaviour in those affected and the virus quickly spreads across a seemingly arbitrary area of land Our protagonists unwittingly wander into the danger zone and have to fight for their lives against hordes of infected Asiansbr br The film seems to be stuck half way between being a zombie gore flick and an out and out action adventure and this confusion is captured most clearly by the zombies themselves They do not appear to have a set of characteristics common to all Some are of the regular soulless shuffling variety so well rendered in the original and probably Fulcis creation here The other main group consist of those who in being infected with the virus lost all sense of themselves but incurred a savage aggression and a desire to earn a black belt in ninjitsu Indecisively leaping around unsure of whether to continue honing their upper roundhouse technique or engage with their brethren in what looks like a mass tickle fest on their hapless victims Martial arts skills arent their only talents either they are well versed in guerilla tactics hiding on rafters and under bales of hay and sometimes inexplicably falling from nowhere but the heavens themselves This is all definitely the work of Matteibr br There is a third more chatty variety of zombie This type apparently retain a sense of irony as well Im really thirstyFOR YOUR BLOOD The ridiculous twist at the end in which the DJ turns zombie but continues to preach ad libbed gibberish about the fate of mankind only serves to enhance the WTF factor and obliterate any hope of a serious resolutionbr br Then theres the infamous zombie head which slowly propels itself through the air a jokerish skeletal grin wrought across its face as if to say yeah we know how bad this looksbr br The characters are all utterly one dimensional as you would expect But its the pseudo comical dialogue and dubbing that really prevents us from taking their plight seriously Having said that the first soldier to die does put up an impressively valiant display against an unstoppable zombie menace Indeed this is the first and perhaps only time we hit real zombie agro and one of the only effective scenes in the filmbr br The guy who played the chief scientist has heart but no talent utilising pauses in his lines entirely at random so he ends up sounding like a confused asthmatic The scientists on screen attempts at finding an antidote are totally unconvincing now lets put these two molecules together br br There are a few moments that stick out as genuinely effective however In an early scene a female protagonist explores an abandoned garage Upon entering a room we are confronted with a hazy view of a shifting figure in the corner and a squirming mass on the floor all shot in an atmospheric diffused light The silence is interrupted by the appearance of a speedy machete wielding zombie who trashes everything in his wake in his alarming desperation to have her His sheer aggressiveness is one of the few moments of real horror in the film The before and after theme conveyed through the hotel that plays host to the happenings of the earliest stage of the outbreak and later as a refuge to our protagonists is imbued with an thick humid ambiance There is a scene in which one of the soldiers cautiously approaches a boarded up room that clearly houses hordes of the undead and this is quite tense Things become more dramatic when they board themselves in the hotel unknowing to what lurks upstairs But this is sloppily handled and not nearly as effective as it could have beenbr br All in all I would say this film may just about deserve to be called a royal screw up of a potentially effective tropical zombie fest rather than simply a through and through bad film If nothing else it has plenty of the unintentional laughs that Ive come to expect from just about anything Italian and gory from the eighties,negative

The Buddy Holly Story opens on a shot of a yellow neon moon on the roof of a roller rink in 1956 Lubbock Texas As the credits start the camera moves down from the moon to the parking lot into the roller rink past the concessions and across the rink to a small bandstand where a small band is doing their sound check Its a tracking shot Welles and Scorcese would both appreciate It cuts to Buddy Hollys bespectacled face peering down in rapt concentration as he grips the headphones and talks to a man putting this band on the radio br br A young Gary Busey plays Buddy Holly and his performance is key He has to somehow show the passion that Holly had for his music to make the film work This is a rock and roll story without lines of coke chased with shots of heroin and a fifth of whiskey This isnt about a man with several women to choose between in a sex scandalized brood abandoned lusty tragedy This is a film about a nice Texas boy who respected his parents and went to church and had the same girlfriend for 5 years and fell in love with rock and roll Busey finds that spark and ignites it his passion is clear and infectious He really plays the guitar in the film and sings its not overdubbed with Hollys recordings Busey was a young guy in Hollywood in the seventies a struggling actor and as much or more so a struggling rock musician as well Thus he gives a great performance because although he isnt Buddy Holly hes in a similar situation br br His first song is the old Les Paul classic Mockingbird Hill and he has the country twang to nail it Next a kid calls out for some bop and against his two band mates in reality the Crickets were 3 guys but the downsizing works fine for the films limited narrativehe leads them wailing into Rocking with Ollie Vee The kids love it and the parents hate it The DJ at the rolling rink tapes it and it is later released in New York without Buddy Holly even knowing it was ever recorded This leads to the funniest scene in a film filled with humorous moments An ampedup disc jockey from Buffalo calls up Buddy at home The DJ has been playing Thatll be the Day for 12 hours and is going for 24 The cops are banging on the stations barricaded door Holly is confused but when the dust settles he is quite thrilled He tells the boys and their meteoric rise begins Dan Stroud as the drummer and Charles Martin Smith as the bassist round out the band nicely and have good chemistry with each other There are problems but not overblown drama thats found in most rock all biopics The movie doesnt manipulate you either Your emotions soar but theyre not manipulated When the Crickets step onto the Apollo stage in Harlem the first white group ever to play there then rip into an electrically charged performance of Oh Boy and win the audience over my rock and roll loving ass got choked up and cried Next Busey and the boys make Its so Easy sound funkier and more soulful than I would have believed possible br br Anyone with even a cursory knowledge of Buddy Hollys story will know where this movie will end Holly died in a plane crash with Richie Valens and the Big Bopper way too young We as the audience know that yet the movie is so well written directed and lovingly acted that we forget it almost immediately The movie isnt about his death its about his life and his place in rock and roll history The film ends with his last performance and its a good fifteen minutes of Busey rocking out possessed by the ghost of Buddy Holly I was happy to hear him end it on Not Fade Away my favorite of his songs The film freezes before the end credits with the information about the plane crash but I hardly noticed it I was still thinking about how good that last song was,positive
The movie that i am going to review is a little television movie made in 1996 and it starred Melissa Joan Hart and Daniel Baldwinbr br The main protagonistantagonist Jennifer Stanton Hart is a typical all American teenager who is feeling the pressure of having such a controlling father Baldwin However when she meets an ex con called Nick Ryan Jeremy Jordan Never been kissed they instantly fall for each other but Jennifer has a different idea on where to take their relationship she manipulates him to kill her parents to protect their love but she just used him to get rid of her parents so she can be with Brad David Lascher future Sabrina cast mate for Hart Melissa Joan Hart actually really surprised me with her role as an evil manipulator and she carries the movie well by using her friends and Nick so she can literally get away with murder The rest of the supporting cast work well and they each hold their own when they have screen time I also found it interesting that this film was made and released the same year Hart began portrayed Sabrina the Teenage Witch and this shows she can act in my genres of film and televisionbr br Although the film has dated somewhat it stills stands out as some of her best work that involves drama or thriller and i am looking forward to Nine Dead that comes out in November because it shows she can seen as other people that are not called Clarissa Darling  or Sabrina Spellmanbr br I recommend this film to anyone that is a fan of Melissa Joan Hart or Sabrina You can watch this on the internet so i suggest check it out,positive
The first music video I ever saw Thriller my mom told me that she took me home from the hospital and when we arrived my sister had MTV on the TV and Thriller was playing my mom said that I smiled Silly I know but I have loved Michael Jackson since that day the music video Thriller inspired me to dance still I have the dance memorized to this day I even performed it for an audience 3 times Words cannot describe the power of this song that makes you wanna sing and dance but Michael of course had to raise the bar for MTV at the time by signing on American Werewolf in London director John Landis and directing the one the only Thrillerbr br Michael and his date Ola Ray run out of gas in a dark wooded area They walk off into the forest and Michael asks her if she would like to go steady She accepts and he gives her a ring He warns her however that he is not like other guys no really not like the other guys A full moon appears and Michael begins convulsing in agony  transforming into a horrifying werewolf His date shrieks and runs away but the werewolf catches up knocking her down and begins lunging at her with its claws The scene cuts away to a movie theater where Michael and his date are actually watching this scene unfold in a movie called Thriller Michael smiles but his date is frightened and tells him shes leaving Michael catches up to her and says that its only a movie but she doesnt like his jokes on her and she starts walking away Michael and his date then walk down a foggy street and he teases her with the opening verses of Thriller They pass a graveyard where corpses suddenly begin to rise from their graves as Vincent Price performs his rap Michael and his date then find themselves surrounded by the zombies and suddenly Michael becomes a zombie himself Michael and the undead perform an elaborate song and dance number together followed by the chorus of Thrillerbr br Thriller is arguably the best music video of all time funny thing is people who wanna argue that is with other Michael Jackson videos but what makes Thriller so special is the dance the story the effects this at the time was the most expensive music video of its day Michael of course rose that bar again with his famous music video Scream and then again with Ghosts But say what you will Michael was the star of the 1980s there was no celebrity like him he loved the life he lived it breathed it and embraced it Thriller is proof that he was willing to work to make the best and thats what we got with the legend that is Thrillerbr br 1010,positive
I saw this movie yesterday and cant stop thinking about it I moved to Norway four months ago and have tried ever since to find the origin of the strange emptiness i felt When I saw this film I was striken with the brilliant snapshot of this society Yes this is all true I too found a great job with a great pay and I live with my norwegian boyfriend in a nice apartment downtown But so far everyone I have met have left me with that tasteless empty feeling I had never had before  this is what this movie is about Dinner parties with nothing to say to each other but emotionless comments long silences no stress a creepy calm and frozen smiles of niceness This Scandinavian nightmare is perfectly rendered in Den Brysomme mannen See this movie,positive
This is probably one of the worst movies ever made Itsterrible But its so good Its probably best if you dont watch it expecting a gripping plot and something fantastically clever and entertaining because youre going to be disappointed However if you want to watch it so you can see 50 million vases and Goros fantastic hairbad English youre in for a real treat The harder you think about the film the worse it gets unless youre having a competition to spot the most plot holesscrew ups in which case youve got hours of entertainment ahead Id only really recommend this film for the bored or the diehard Smap fans And even then the latter should be a bit careful because Goros Japanese fans were a bit upset about it they thought he was selling himself out He wasnt really not when Johnny Kitagawa who was the executive producer can do that for him,positive

Watching The Tenants has been a interesting experience for me It is the first film I have ever seen where I have shuttled at speed through parts of the nonaction  and I can normally watch anything from turgid action movies to SerboCroat indie and find them fascinatingbr br The Tenants is frustratingly sluggish and overorchestrated One of the main problems of the script is there is little realistic character dialogue apart from the set pieces where characters collide in a very structured setting to make this work the film needed to feel more conceptual which it didnt This leads to a lack of realistic character development everyone seems twodimensionalbr br The worse for this is the character of Bill Spear aka Snoop Dogg I found his characterization very uncomfortable and very unsympathetic At one point I even stopped the film because I got so annoyed by the characters aggressive violent and monotonal delivery the lack of any other personality layer apart from that of the reactionary on switch which gets really predictable after a while and I so desperately wanted him to have some redeeming qualities However one reason for this jar might be the nebulous time scape of the film supposedly 70s it feels and looks more early noughties If it had been more securely fixed in the 70s his character might have seemed more understandablebr br The lighting of the film was also awkward All the way through the soundtrack attempts to provide a certain gritty jazzinfused atmosphere that just did not come off largely because the set was too welllitbr br The Tenants to me is an unbelievable film It doesnt depict real people or propose any interesting ways of thinking about race identity or the life of a writer be they white or blackbr br Strangely I came away with the feeling that this project needed David Lynch his eerie clastrophobic and obsessive look and feel would have lifted both the actors and the script into something quite remarkable,negative
This was shown on a premium channel so I didnt realise it was made for TV Even so I like some of the movies on lifetime Lifestyle here in UK but this was awful The family were so cheesy Love you mum Love you even more honey Then after they were broken into for the second time 10 mins later they were at it again Love you mum big cheesy smiles etc She phones her husband and tells him not to bother coming home They were only broken into by a guy that wanted them dead have a nutter living next door who needs help She has her teenage daughter and a cat not for long to look after herbr br However as a comedy Id give it a good 7 I might even show it to my friends next time I have them round Could be great fun after a bottle of Vodka or 10,negative
Okay I agree with all the Barney haters on this site I think Barney and his friends are all ugly looking and obnoxious and the show is very lop sided and unrealisticbr br But the thing that ticked me off the most is how Barney presented Gays Lesbians and Bisexuals on his show when talking about same sex parents and relatives That wouldnt be so much of a problem if the creators of this show didnt use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals I mean not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink and not all lesbians are ugly and manly looking with a bosom that sags to their abdomen As a bisexual female I just think this is terrible for a childrens show If this were South Park I wouldnt mind it because South Park is for people who can distinguish fantasy from reality A lot of people who watch Barney are little kids or handicapped people who cant usually distinguish fantasy from realitybr br And now that I think about it Barney sort of comes off as an ugly gay stereotype himself Lets see he doesnt have a girlfriend hes pinkish colored and wears clothes with sequins yes its true on it If you claim to be for the rights of gay and bisexual individuals then stop making a mockery out of them in front of people who dont know any better If Barney went blackface and ate fried chicken and watermelon at the same time the show would be pulled off the air before you know itbr br I give this show a negative one out of five Dont show your kids such hateful crap There are childrens shows out there that are so less insulting,negative
this movie was just plain dumb i do not think it was scary at all i went in hoping to be shocked and scared but was mostly laughing some of the scenes were just to fake and thrown together blood scenes were extremely over cg and some of the mutants were ridiculously gay looking it also sucked because the acting was just plain horrible u think they could get some good actors and most of the characters i hated just because how stupid and lame they acted even though they were supposed to be in the military i get to watch movies for free and seen many people walking out im guessing because it was so dumb kinda glad i didnt have to pay for it in short DUMB ASS MOVIE dont see itbut then again thats my opinion,negative
It would be something to try and tell someone what Fata Morgana is very simply about Or maybe it isnt Herzog goes to the Sahara desert and nearby villages to film assorted landscapes and the locals But this is just the broadest stroke Its a feat that you either surrender yourself to or you dont He gets into the form of the world around him entirely without a story bound only to certain aspects of written poetry as his camera shooting on supposedly discarded film stock wanders like in a pure travelogue One might even jump to that easy conclusion as he puts up these immense landscapes then moving to more rough civilized culture though not the actual normal culture itself and to a point levels too abstract to be able to convey properly here Sometimes it takes a while to get along close to a purity through the creation section but a purity in how parts are manipulated either by nature or by brokendown machines Soon the narration readings from the Popol Vuh who by the way does the music for most of his films with the gradual procession of actually highly stylized shots adds a whole different level to it Its a hybrid film and its not easy but the rewards are what best comes closest to Herzogs idea of ecstatic truth images hes been out for his whole careerbr br One wonders if the images end up by the time the second section Paradise leading along the words spoken or if its the other way around Youre eyes are moving along with the stills and pans and the wording is close to being religious writing but theres also the music choices how the bizarrely spare singing and lowkey classical music goes together with Leonard Cohen and Blind Faith I think each side ends up complimenting the other and its something that still seems like it shouldnt work Perhaps thats the draw to it the chances taken in going through desolate wastelands and the smallest run sections of any kind of civilized life in this case the shacks of the desert that make it so fascinating If only for the cinematographic sense its a marvel too indescribable for the casual photography fan because of molds of technique and some of the strangest images of any Herzog film Theres pans theres longshots theres handheld while driving by the towns theres a bus dozens of miles away that via mirage seems only a couple theres fullon closeups of fire and a man holding a reptile and talking about its radar truly classic gonzo comedy theres people holding still in fake poses and a man and woman playing inane music But most importantly it ends up feeling at least for me natural for the personal nature of the approachbr br Im sure only Herzog would know for certain why he made this film as opposed to the simple how he was already filming Even Dwarfs Started Small and he ended up going through many perils to finish it Yet this is what makes Fata Morgana such an amazing feat it will appeal to one depending on what someone brings to it in actually watching it Its definitely unsettling but theres the temptation to want to see it again very soon after just to experience all of the ideas and realities turned abstracted strange vibes yes the word vibes applies here Its one of the truly spectacular artfilms ever made,positive
Martin Weisz who directed the solid Rohtenburg will be taking the heat with Wes Craven for another shabby The Hills Have Eyes 2 The memory of the legendary original which boasted an unbelievable storyline and a dog having a flashback will be erased forever by this more technically polished remake in name only A bunch of National Guardsmen and women are sent to a desert research area surrounded by hills filled with mutants One by one the weekend soldiers are picked off Thats it There is some hardcore violence and a reasonably brutal rape scene but there is precious little else to get excited about The films heroes are the usual bunch of clichés and the mutants a far cry from Cravens original family mostly resemble Brian Thompson from Cobra coupled with some creatures Stan Winston had left over from the Wrong Turn shoot Much of the action takes place in caves ala The Descent and is well shot by Sam McCurdy A laughable aspect is Wes and Jonathan Cravens addition of a sympathetic mutant who skulks around his cave like Leatherface in Hoopers original Chainsaw Weisz will be blamed for this dull debacle but hes not really at fault because he does his best to maintain suspense and squeeze some freshness out of the contrived situations Not a fan unfortunately,negative
By the time this movie came out in 1996 director Mark Lester had been making tight sharp little B action pictures for more than 20 years He was responsible for the great Truck Stop Women from the 70s and several other little gems unfortunately hes also responsible for this dud Its a shame to see the talentedand still smoking hotTheresa Russell wasted yet again but shes still the best actor in this picture Eric Roberts shows up for a while does his Eric Roberts thing then goes away a not altogether unwelcome occurrence in a picture with Eric Roberts in it Frank Stallone actually isnt bad which should give you an idea of how truly pathetic this picture is As has been mentioned by other reviewers the action sceneswhich is the reason a picture like this gets made in the first placeare almost completely illogical and unrealistic in addition to being somewhat inept Other than some vintage clothes and a few old cars theres no feel whatever for the 1930s the era in which this film is set A bythenumbers script with irritating lapses in logic and little historical accuracythis isnt a documentary of course but the filmmakers could have at least TRIED for a little authenticityand performances that range from grade B to grade school relegate this cheap little quickie to the 400 am Sunday slot on HBO which is just where I saw it,negative
This is an excellent documentary packed with racing action beautiful pictures and a great story The IMAX Cameras give you a very wide perspective as a DVD movie it is perfect Your hear every speaker working almost all the time The film is not speeded up and just gives you the natural feel of 230mph Of course there are some sound effects added but i think they are good they give a depth to the driving scenes,positive
A masterpiece of comedy a masterpiece of horror a masterpiece of romance if there is anything negative to say about A Chinese Ghost Story it might be that the special effects looked dated in comparison to modern technology The film has a simple premise a poor debt collector has to stay in a secluded area while trying to collect a debt Of course it happens to be haunted as wellbr br What I wasnt expecting the first time I saw this film is that its one of the most touching love stories Ive ever seen that is without losing any of the slapstick comedy that will have you in stitches Unlike some films of Asian cinema A Chinese Ghost Story isnt hard to swallow for those that arent versed in Chinese culture Indeed it plays on timeless cultureless themes of the paranormal and romancebr br Think Evil Dead 2 if they had thrown a wonderful love story into the mix This film is for real despite being overlooked by many Its absolutely among the best Ive ever seen Its ability to combine the best aspects of multiple genres and cross cultural boundaries in order to appeal to humanity everywhere is nothing short of fantastic Highly recommended 1010,positive
The DVD version we bought had Sandra Bullock on the cover but weve discovered it was a picture of her from another movie Unfortunately she is in this movie very little You can however see how far she has comebr br The one other bright spot in the movie besides her very small part were a few of the location scenes shot in NYC and New Jersey in the 1980sbr br The sound is terrible Sometimes the background noise is so loud that the dialog is difficult to hear Sometimes the dialog has been redone without any background noises at all which is disconcerting For example sometimes when they are in the car the noises from the car are too loud and then suddenly there is absolutely no extra noise at all The director is fond of closeups on faces and then its clear that the movie has been overdubbed because the words dont match the lip movements Through most of the movie the voices sound like the people are speaking into a tin canbr br Background music when there is music is distracting instead of adding to the moviebr br The direction is laughable Goofy camera angles and sound effects make the movie look like a joke especially during times when there is supposed to be tension like in the middle of gun battles The writing is terrible There are some subplots that make no sense and most of the characters come off looking very stupid because there is no explanation at all to their motivations The writerdirector tries to explain some of the relationships between the men that were together in Vietnam but none of it makes sense These top assassins and former soldiers dont seem to be able to see other peoples shadows or hear other people moving The actors go from calm to panic and back to calm again without any warning Its simply a combination of bad directing and bad writingbr br The production values are so bad that at first we thought we had stumbled on someones student film that just happened to have Sandra Bullock in it If you like laughing at really poorly done student films then this movie is for you Otherwise avoid this movie,negative
PEP SQUAD is at a very low point with its confusing plot line and horrible actingbr br First lets tackle the characters Cherry Brooke Balderson continues to hold an outrageous boiling anger throughout the entire film which is due to her overwhelming passion to become prom queen However it becomes completely unknown to the audience why Cherry wants to become prom queen in the first place Before the nominations are even read off she storms around the school with a constant disinterest upon being there and shows no interest in the place or its students to begin with Why does she care so much to be their prom queen Brooke Balderson apparently presents an acclaimed performance but in reality just spends the entire time with an angry face stomping around killing people Maybe its just me but I think if you handed any young actoractress a script that only requires himher to act insanely angry youre not asking for much Youre also not allowing the character to develop very wellbr br Beths character played by Jennifer Dreiling is even worse Dreiling shows absolutely no emotion and no connection to her character whatsoever When being harassed by her principal she knocks him down after several seconds with no feelings of disgust or shock or anything equally traumatizing Her lines are read like she is reading trivia off the back of a cereal boxbr br Throughout the rest of the film the students in charge of his kidnapping sound more like they are planning a barbecue than deciding what they will do with their principal sitting tied up in their basementbr br Meanwhile Cherry is off killing several female prom queen candidates and no one even notices or cares Yeah I get it I get it the whole town is worried about prom Very realistic At least you could throw in some funny scenes with the cops but that might be asking too much For example right after Cherry drives by the school and shoots down a handful of students Beth is found being interviewed by the local media The reporter mentions the shooter in a way that makes it seem like no one knows who killed these innocent students but then one second later asks What do you think about guns in the hands of minors or something to that effect Where did the reporter jump to such conclusions br br At the end of the movie after Cherry kills the winning prom queen and prom is deemed over with the media showing up again Beth simply adds that she understands Cherrys need to be heard and walks away with her friends smoking cigarettes in a calm unaltered mood No one is even strayed by the fact that they just witnessed a murderbr br Not to mention the students constantly parking in a yellow zone and no one seeming to care that there is a sudden rise in violence in the town Julie living in a large house with no parents present and the bizarre party at her house Maybe Im a little left out of the scene but last time I knew high school parties did not involve naked women artistically dancing in a pool of water while men bob for marshmallows and everyone basks in their Im so indie and mod attitudes Beths parents horrible acting with her mother acting overthetop and her father simply nodding at everything the mother has to say and not in an entertaining way either along with stupid scenes such as the new black principal running after Cherry as she tries to shoot her with a gun Yes Very realisticbr br The only compliment I can give this movie is that the photography is wonderful The angles are flattering and the screen is very clear and crisp with each shotbr br Too bad the acting and script arent,negative

Hm Where do I start I usually ignore whatever rating IMDb has when looking up a movie because I think I might like it anyway or whatever and I should at least give it a chance but this time I wish Id paid attentionbr br I know some people liked it and Im not trying to say that they shouldnt It was semiamusing at some parts But if youre like me and you dont like watching cats prancing around in the undergrowth for 20 minutes random fast motion cloud scenes dogs barking in cages for another 20 minutes set to thrilling music and closeups of faces while people are speaking then you might want to avoid this movie The actors were either positively wooden or way over the top and the film quality was awful fuzzy and grainy and bland and not in an artistic way at all And I know that we were supposed to think that Carol was not just a crazy maniac with a gun shooting innocent people with this weird religious psychosis going on but well she doesnt really convince me otherwise In fact I ended up really disliking her crazy character And what was up with the souls in space I understand this is a fantasy movie but come onbr br I will say the angel at the end was freaking creepy It was the creepiest thing in the whole movie WAY more creepy than the Darth Maul lavaface demon I give them props for that scene it was good But not good enough to actually see the movie And the opening credits were great but dont be fooled I wouldve rather they used whatever money went into those credits to make the movie betterbr br Bah I wish I hadnt bought this for even the 2 that I paid for it I could have bought a candy bar instead ,negative

I really cant see why people seem to dislike this film I found it very entertaining of course the fact that it stars the gorgeous Laura Fraser is a bonus When I first heard about it I thought it would be along the lines of a rolereversed Weird Science and to an extent this is true however there is a twist which I really didnt see coming Having seen the trailer on the DVD which I hadnt seen before watching the film I saw that the twist is actually shown in the trailer Very strangebr br As the film progresses the Weird Science comparison fits less and less and I think this is the better of the two films Certainly there are some scenes which dont work wonderfully but these are made up for by the enthusiasm of the young castbr br In summary Id suggest that this is a fine example of a Scifi chick flick and I dont think Ive seen many of them,positive
Black and white satire of a Madison Avenue ad agency being taken over by blacks Theyre headed by Putney Swope Arnold Johnson who is determined to change things However he turns out to be even WORSE than his white predecessors Thats about as original as this getsbr br Im sure this was considered daring and shocking in 1969 but it just seems silly today The jokes are either unfunny the president is a midget HOW is this funny cruel or obvious and the film is full of unlikable characters Its done in a very experimental way which makes it even harder to takeor understand The movie just gets more bizarre and surreal as it goes along The ending comes out of nowhere To make it worse with the sole exception of Johnson ALL the acting is bad Antonio Fargas a regular in these types of films is especially annoying as the Arab This gets three stars because the commercial parodies done in bright color ARE amusing and theres a rare good line here and there I heard this was a cult classic but this is more interesting than good Skip itunless youre in experimental 1960s films,negative
I went to see this film yesterday and although i didnt have high hopes for this film I was still bitterly disappointed I actually cant believe I spent 96 minutes of my life watching this filmit was THAT bad The storyline was disgraceful and the acting was terrible even though it had big names such as Uma Thurman in it This film heavily relied on its special effectsbut they personally had no effect on me I honestly wished id never watched it and I strongly warn everyone against seeing this film It is a total waste of money and youll only end up being disappointed afterwards My advice is to save your money go shopping treat yourself just dont go and see this film Youll live to regret it lol,negative
I had never heard about this movie when it was given to me to translate so I didnt know what to expect I checked it out on IMDb and got curious It didnt take long to realize that this was a gem Outstanding performances great story and its both well directed and well written Its hard to compare it to other movies but Stand by me comes to mind although it has as many differences from The cure as similarities The tale of an extraordinary friendship between young boys plus the dramatic and humorous elements are the most obvious similarities between this movie and Stand by me Other than that The cure is a fine movie in its own right well worth a wider recognition Its dramatic but also adventurous sad but also humorous I cant think of a single thing that bothers me about it Having said that I dont want to give the impression that it is a perfect movie whatever that means but rather that I enjoyed it immensely was very moved by it and wouldnt change a thing in it I wont go into a detailed description of the storyplot partly because it would be either too general or too revealing and partly because you can find that information elsewhere on the site In closing I can only say Wonderful movie see it if you get the chance,positive
What was always missing with the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world Say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases What was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people cant believe the contrary Well represented and put together this a true testament to how illogical humans can be,positive
The movie started off strong LL Cool J Deed as an undercover police officer with partner Sgt Lazerov Dylan McDermott from the Practice possibly miscast as a bad guy committing robbery and murder Deed refuses to kill the drug dealer which sets up the conflict of a dirty cop with a conscience The other big names Freeman Spacey et al are well cast and the movie shows promisebr br The movie begins to fall short as soon as Justin Timberlake Pollack is introduced Given the opportunity to make a good movie that people will possibly see repeatedly or one that teenage girls will go and see the once because of Timberlake I would choose the former Even talented actors have to work hard at their craft Timberlake is NOT talented and no amount of hard work can save him I would have thought he would put on a better show given the fact that he has been acting talented for years Everything he did in this film was unconvincingbr br Just because a singer sells millions of records and sells out stadiums it does not automatically translate that they can act successfully in feature films Even hardcore NSync fans will not be able to ignore the obvious lack of acting talentbr br That aside there are a few plot holes such as Pollacks sudden sniper ability and deadly operation of warehouse machinery This movie had so much promise Thoroughly disappointing,negative
After Harry Reems teenage girlfriend is raped by Zebbedy Colt The NightWalker Reems becomes despondent and consoles himself by having sex with some lesbians Meanwhile Colt who carries a cane and dresses like a magician rapes some more women Eventually Reems decides to track him down and end his crime spree Despite being shot on film and marginally nasty it looks like any other 70s porno and is ineptly executed The rapeabuse scenes are surprisingly restrained and the attempt to cash in on Death Wish is laughable R Bolla Cannibal Holocaust plays a cop Colt who is usually overthetop wigs out in a couple of scenes but hes too well behaved for my money This roughie could have been much rougher,negative
Revenge on us the viewing public perhaps I sat through this 2 hour movie and i was waiting for the second act to kick in so that the movie lived up to its title But Costner never avenges his lovers fate she dies and the movie ends I was left wondering where the rest of the movie was If a movie is called Revenge then the hero better get some by the end of the film I had a choice of seeing this or Black Rain at the cinema thankfully i saw The other brothers movie at the cinema insteadi caught up with this turkey on video there was one good thing about the film and was its beautiful theme tune Listen to the cddont watch this its awful 1 out of 10,negative
This film is about a Japanese woman who has an obsession with calligraphy on skinbr br The plot is absolutely bizarre I fail to see any sensual or erotic undertones The plot turns an ancient art form into a fetishistic pornography In addition the scenes that are filmed in Hong Kong are certainly portraying bad parts of Hong Kong such as the airport in the middle of the city poor living conditions and noise pollution Throughout the whole film I keep thinking that The Pillow Book is insulting the Japanese culture and the Hong Kong environmentbr br The Pillow Book is a perverted yet boring film Seriously stay away from it,negative
and I for one think that is a good thing Ive just never been a Rosalind Russell fan although the original was my favorite RR movie But I love Bette and was thrilled to hear she was making thisbr br As for the rest of the production I think it was slightly less than the original movie One of my favorite minor characters in the original was Mazeppa with her scratchy fingernailsontheblackboard voice belting out HEY It takes a lot more than no talent to be a strippah and although I missed it I was glad to see the producers had the guts not to do a carbon copybr br I also liked the fact there are large portions of this movie which were filmed as if you are looking at a stage it gives a feeling that you are in the theatre not just at the moviesbr br I think the other thing I liked about this production was that there seemed to be slightly less repetition of the song Let me entertain you which becomes completely annoying after about the 5th time you hear it,positive

On account of my unfortunately not being able to find them anywhere I have not gotten to try any of the other entries in the series although I certainly would not mind and trust me I have looked For anyone who does not know this is a pointandclick adventure title That means that the mouse is what you use to interface with everything that you can do so with in this though there is one particular case in this where that is inaccurate I wont spoil it here for anyone who havent yet tried it Nevertheless regardless of how little experience you have with computers you can sit right down and try this There isnt even terribly many bits of this where you need to be fast or have swift reflexes Heck you can adjust the speed of the textif you have it have subtitles on and thus of the talking in it and its not enormously awkward or forced when slow Accessing your inventory is easy as well as combining or using items Clicking and holding down the button at anything you can affect gives three options for what to use with itbe it a person a specific part of the surroundings or an object Handpush pick up open etc eyesexamine look through etc and moutheat converse etc This all adds up to a welcoming friendly environment where you can approach the plentiful puzzlesthe amount of them is varied based on which of the two difficulty settings you try this on at your own pace and explore and take in the dozens of individual creatively done characters and areas in this to your hearts content The length of this will be determined by how much time you take to do suchyoull hear no blame from me theyre worth it and your skill at figuring out the solutions There are a few points in this where you get to decide if you want the harder way of completing that or not This can be enjoyed by anyone from any age Theres no material that isnt acceptable for children This is one of the products that help prove that that very fact does not have to mean that it is intolerable for older audiences The animation is quality work smooth everything moves as it should and the 3rd dimension honestly isnt that sorely missed when trying this The storytelling is welldone and youre never unclear as to what is going on There are numerous welldirected cutscenes kept in the same colorful mostly bright 2D world as the rest with welldone camera motion Cartoony is an appropriate word to describe this and not only the visual style It can be applied to all of this The entire world of this is very similar to but not quite the same as ours with a mix of past and present inhabited by people and filled with things that we can sort of recognize or understand at least portions of but the absurdity makes them funny That would have to be one of the greatest strengths of this right there Its hilarious A lot of that comes from the lines spokenwhat is said as well as how it is and those who dig British efforts with focus on verbal the likes of Allo Allo or the BlackAdder franchise will want to check this sucker out However there are several different types of jokes including but not limited to the following Satire cleverness dark spoofs irony grossout comedynot exactly my favorite aspect of this and more Theres selfawareness with the lead addressing you personally and for example explaining why he isnt going to do what you just asked him to There are references to pop culture through a couple of decades Almost all of it works hardly any gags fall flat and if you arent in stitches during this my best guess as to the reason would be that its simply not compatible with your sense of humor a situation that warrants no judgment and if one suspects that could be the case and wishes to find out I suggest the demo version where you for free can see if you care for the brand of play andor laughter The plot is wellwrittennearly all of this is really develops nicely throughout and keeps your interest well The audio is all excellent crisp and welldone The sound effects are spoton The music is wellcomposed with no exceptions The voice acting is impeccable with a celebrity or two Armato is fantastic as Guybrush Threepwoodgotta love that name whom you control Boen is incredible as LeChuck the deceasedand still threatening zombie villain The designs are immensely welldone highly imaginative and all fit In spite of the relatively limited disposition of our hero when it comes to pirate deeds you do get to engage in some Steer a ship board that of others and match blades in a rather unique and marvelously thought up way The replayability lies mainly in the choices during dialog etc This is linear with a tad freedom as far as the order goes so the buccaneer sitting down with this for at least the second time has not got that large an amount of possibilities as far as being challenged by this goes unless he or she has forgotten what to do in the meantime Ah nothing is perfect Anyone who would care to delve into a thoroughly wellcrafted and fascinating fictional universe and crack up countless times should get a real kick out of this The good kind not the ones that hurt and potentially leave bruises Dont forget kids do not eat books that is just begging for a papercut I would wager a guess that those who like the others would appreciate this one too And theyre not the only ones who may get into this I recommend this to apart from members of aforementioned group any fan of this genre of VGs as well as anyone to whom this review appeals 810,positive
How could a film dealing with illegal Mexican immigrants being robbed and beaten over the border be dull Well Border Incident isbr br No wonder that song and dance man George Murphys career ended not long after this terrible film came out Politics was certainly a way out for this future senator who dies a horrible death in this slowly paced film The film stereotypes the typical Mexican migrant farmer worker as dimwitted and awfully dullbr br The film only picks up in intensity once the identities of Murphy and Ricardo Montalban have been discovered as federal agents for the US and Mexico respectivelybr br Disappointing at best we see similar problems in our very own society today,negative

Watching this was like getting a large mackerel slapped in your face over and over again Even when you thought That mackerel surely cant be coming around again slap there it was Im not sure what they were thinking This is the sort of pilot I watched and wondered Did the actors know they were on a doomed ship destined to never be made into a series Not only black stereotypes but Swedish and Indian ones as well And while Blazing Saddles made these stereotypes into a mix of comedy and uncomfortableness these stereotypes were just downright offensive There was no plot line the ending was slapped on and the jokes arent Still if you are a student of comedy watch this pilot to see what you shouldnt do,negative

Beyond the Clouds is an overthetop artsy group of four vignettes each a offering a glimpse into a manwoman relationship from the tenuous to the turbulent Although the film offers superb cinematography some exquisite visual beauty and a cast of fine performers theres little meat on the bones of this fragmented work A taste of a relationship cannot impart the fullness of it and synergism suggests that much more can be accomplished with one story in 2 hours than with four Nonetheless Beyond the Clouds will be fodder for dilettantes and a visual feast for the all albeit superficial stilted and lacking in substance,positive

I consider Saboteur as Hitchcocks first American film because the story takes place completely in USbr br There are brilliant scenes in this film Statue of Liberty Scene Barry Kane jumping into the water from the bridge Water fall scene are amazing Its not Hitchcocks fault that he didnt get the actors he wanted Hitchcock originally wanted Gary Cooper for the leading roles in Foreign Correspondent and Saboteur But Gary Cooper wasnt interested in doing a thriller Another reason why Hitchcock didnt get big stars was because he wasnt one of top directors Although Rebecca was a huge success still most of films success went to Producer David O Selznick For Example David O Selznick got Best Picture Oscar for Rebecca And Hitchcock didnt get a Best Director Oscar for Rebecca Hitchcock started getting some attention after Foreign Correspondent 1940 But Universal gave him a lowbudget for Saboteur 1942 Hitchcock tried to get Joel McCrea for this film because he was willing to work with Hitchcock again with a low salary He enjoyed working with Hitchcock in Foreign Correspondent 1940 But he was unavailable So the role went to Robert Cummings Hitchcock called Robert Cummings a competent performer I thought he did his best He was a less known actor who was willing to play a role when many big actors refused to play the leading male rolebr br As for leading female role Hitchcock wanted Margaret Sullavan or Barbara Stanwyck for the leading role They werent interested either So Universal decided to give the role to Priscilla Lane I read in a book that this was one of her favorite filmsbr br I also liked the scene at Blind Mans house That is my favorite scene If we listen closer to the dialogue in scenes that happen in Uncle Philips house then we will see how intense it is Uncle Philip Blind Man was studying Barry Kanes character the moment he entered his house The moment Barry entered his house he heard Barrys handcuffs Through conversation he realized that Barry Kane isnt a criminal at all We also see his hearing ability through those scenes For Example Barry hears the sound of a car says Is that a car coming Uncle Philip says 2 cars I think Uncle Philip was right We see 2 cars in the next scene Priscilla Lane did a fine job playing her role She was no big star But I thought her performance was really good Another brilliant scene in Uncle Philips house is the scene where he asks Priscilla Lane Patricia Martin Are you frightened Pat Is that what makes you so cruel I thought Otto Krueger played the villain brilliantly Hitchcock wanted Harry Carey for the villain But he refused Harry Carey is famous for his role Mr President in Mr Smith goes to Washington I want to mention more about this film But I think my post is getting too longbr br Every Hitchcock film is special in its own way I am sure Hitchcock fans will like this film I rate 10 out of 10,positive

This film could have been a decent remake and gosh knows it tried or Ms English tried Assembling talented actors together with a successful  experienced writerdirector should be a formula for a decent film But Ms Englishs experience  according to her IMDb bio  is exclusively limited to television work and it is glaringly obvious throughout this filmbr br I am surprised that none of the reviews I have read mention what I found most unlikeable about this film and what kept it from reaching even a portion of its potential it looked and felt like it was made for television To give some credit to Ms English many of the jokes that simply did NOT work on a movie screen would have been terrific on TV and maybe a laugh track would have helped So much of the camera usage and the lighting would have played out fine on TV but looked awkward or odd on a big screen If the whole film had been chopped up into a miniseries or a sitcom I think it could have worked But this is cinema and sadly Ms Englishs talents didnt translate I cringed at so many different points in my embarrassment for the actors  the writers that I felt like I came out of the theater half shriveled Meg Ryan is her usual perky cute self except for the awful plastic surgery she has had on her face but where did she have a chance to use her talent She has made films where she doesnt recreate her stereotyped role and done them well but not here Annette Bening seemed to simply go through the motions  such a great talent and yet such a poor performance I enjoyed the other women characters but they were more caricature than substance and it was sad to see What worked in this film in the 1930s doesnt translate to the 2000s and no one helped Ms English get the changes  updates or subtleties right If only she as writer director AND producer had reached out for some assistance I think it could have been good But it was notbr br Its so frustrating to go to a movie that has good stars and a good writer or director and come away feeling it was a waste of everyones time  money This New Yorker cartoon I saw yesterday is appropriate A few movie execs are having a meeting  the caption reads Lets remake a classic with worse everything,negative
The film portrays Frances unresolved problems with its colonial legacy in Western Francophone Africa through the befuddled and complex psychoanalytical prism of a young woman France herein symbolically representing her nation It is an often engaging and challenging portrait of a young womans desire to come to terms with a traumatic moment in her past in particular and a nations desire to reach out to the other it once owned and moulded This is reflected in the way in which it centres entirely around the notion of travelling or being in transit from the present to the past remembered realities to undeniable contemporary political and economic actualitiesbr br The characters all play a symbolic albeit a limited and unconvincing role France meant to be a visual as well as a totemic representation of contemporary French society leaves one indifferent to her plight as she seems still to be imbued with the same naiveté she enjoyed as a childin fact as a child she seems more in possession of her reality The rest of the ragtag ensemble is just forgettable The black Africans are to say the least offencive impressionistic portraits of former colonised peoples now colonised by the directors poor handling of her material They are no more than a dark and moribund backdrop against which the blythelike France wonders seeking a world she never knew and hoping for one that can never be found in Cameroon,negative

I saw Bon voyage 2 days ago and I found it an excellent production The film is supposed to entertain and it does It emulates the style of the American screwball comedies of the 30s but Von voyage is more refined Adjani and Depardieu are simply excellent in their roles The plot is simple The film starts with people involved in many situations that apparently should have nothing to do between them It is very funny how those situations become linked during the film It is good to see a French film with this kind of sense of humor I find it principally a film in which love is the main theme Peter Coyote as the German spy in France shows once more to be an excellent actor too,positive
One of the more prominentpopular episodes but clearly one of the worst A redshirt female falls for Khan instead of dropping dead  for a change and then proceeds to betray Kirk and the Enterprise as if loyalty were a nonexistent character trait on the ship Makes one wonder what kind of psychology tests this supposedly brilliant Starfleet uses to test people when hiring We have the same kind of absurd lack of loyalty in Wink Of An Eye when a redshirt male takes the enemys side just because he falls in love Same as in SS However in that episode the betrayal plays a tiny role in the overall plot This is very silly because it once again makes Kirks crew seem like a bunch of softheaded easytoimpress morons who  once they fall in love with the enemy  are capable of doing just about anything The fact that McGivers switches back to Kirks side doesnt ameliorate the illogic in any way Lord McGiveth and the Lord McTakethbr br Why is Khan kept behind a regular door when they know he has superior strength Thats one of several ST plotdevices that undermine Kirks intelligence Why does Khan hold a knife against McCoys throat If Khan is of such superior intelligence then one would expect him to be more wily with the way he carries himself And whats with a Sikh being played with a Latino accent Montalban should have been provided with a vocal coach I was halfexpecting to hear the plaaain the plaaaain in the background at any moment Why the hell would Kirk or any ship captain provide limitless use of the ships library concerning the innermost technical details of the Enterprise to ANYONE Is the Starfleet an institution solely consisting of idiots br br SS is a very cartoonish silly episode so no wonder Trekkies love it It doesnt have too many scifi elements in it which is what Trekkies hate the most It also figures that the ST franchise chose to revive this dull character for the second movie that way pleasing rabid Trekkies who were so very disappointed with the first movie which  you guessed it  had far too much scifi for the average tiny Trekkie brain,negative
Frank Sinatra plays a nogoodnik exsoldier and frustrated writer hardliving and harddrinking who returns to his Midwestern hometown and reunites with his estranged brother Arthur Kennedy now the town bigshot with a disinterested wife and headstrong daughter Frank gets involved with gambler Dean Martin uneducated flooze Shirley MacLaine and has some runins with the law but what he really wants to do is write and settle down with a good woman Oversimplified drama verging on soap opera with a role for MacLaine that is by turns overly colorful and embarrassingly sentimental her drunken belting on After Youve Gone is however the films highlight and is expertly handled Director Vincente Minnelli oversees it in straightforward fashion but hes in surprisingly glum spirits and most of the big scenes are flat or dense The picture looks incredibly handsome in widescreen with a nice eye for detail and composition but the story and these characters are stuck in the dregs  from ,negative
I loved this movie Im a Mexican and was in the least offended by it In fact I think this movie should be shown at police headquarters all over Mexico Its a sad truth that our police system is as rotten as a 3 month old corpse It angers me to read in the news how killers kidnappers and other slime go free by paying a laughable fine or live like kings inside prison cells We should have someone like Creasy Denzel Washingtons character A bodyguard turned vengeful vigilante Kidnapping is flourishing industry down here at least in the big cities I actually wish real life kidnappers could suffer the same fate as the ones Creasy did his fine job upon That would be so marvelous Sorry I am THAT resentful MAN ON FIRE is a gripping film that you cant miss It might be hard on some of you if you arent used to reading subtitles Mexicans do that ALL the time while watching American movies but the effort will be well worth it Some of the editing is a bit fuzzykind of like TRAFFIC remember another brilliant take on how corrupt Mexico is The movie starts out a bit slow but the pace picks up frantically by the second half I swear youll be cheering as you watch Denzel Washington dispatch the wrong doers His performance is nothing short of Excellent The ending no spoilers OK is a bit sad but Im sure youll like it anyway MAN ON FIRE is one of the years best movies A must own for a DVD collection 9 out of 10,positive
As I watched one of Orson Welles last contributions to Hollywood as a filmmaker I knew I was watching a great movie unfold though at times I did not know why The story in The Lady from Shanghai has the prime elements of a filmnoir averageJoe lead femme fatale conspicuous supporting characters and a comprehensible if somewhat convoluted plot structure It is an entertaining ride and its filled to the brim with Welles unique gifts as a director but there are scenes that tend to just not work or dont feel complete in what was Welles full vision the latter is unfortunately too true executive producer Harry Cohn and the Columbia execs are to blame for thatbr br Welles costars with his then wife the profoundly gorgeous Rita Hayworth as Mike OHara an Irish worker who can and does get angry at the right people Hayworth is Mrs Bannister married to Mr Bannister Everett Sloane who played Mr Bernstein in Citizen Kane who is accompanied by a friend Mr Grisby Glenn Anders who has great control in his eyes They want to go sailing on their yacht and take OHara along for the ride and at first hes reluctant but agrees since hes falling for the married Mrs As their journey unfolds OHara finds that Bannister and Grisby are not pleasant to be around and more so with Grisby who at first seems out of his gourd Yet as the plot unfolds OHara is drawn into a scam that Grisby is planning for insurance money with results that I dare not reveal although they have been discussed over and over by othersbr br Whatever liabilities pop up here and there in the mystery part of the story and those few noticeable moments where shots were studio dictated the performances and the look of the film are what remains striking after over fiftyfive years Though he doesnt have the terrific Greg Tolland Kanes DP at his side dependable Charles Lawton Jr assists Welles in creating an atmosphere that is both elegant and stark covered in shadows deep focus low angles the works A particular accomplishment is the funhouse mirror scene which is merely a highlight among others Welles himself is always dependable as an actor even if his accent isnt anything special and Hayworth herself makes a scene a little more lush despite her path in the story br br The Lady from Shanghai is worth checking out especially for Welles Hayworth or filmnoir buffs fans of the Coen brothers might find this fascinating as well It may just take a little while repeat viewings as was for Touch of Evil for the underlying motives in the plot to sink in,positive
Love Jones cleverly portrays young AfricanAmerican men and women in a clear positive realistic sense I feel that all of the actors and actresses were magnificent and really did a great job at capturing the mood Nia Long and Larenz Tate worked well together and I hope to see more work from the two of them As a matter of fact all of the actorsactresses did such a fine job it would be great to see another romanticcomedy from them This movie can be compared to most any wellwritten romantic comedy If you have not seen this movie already I strongly recommend that you do it can definitely give you another perspective on life and love,positive
VIVAH in my opinion is the best movie of 2006 coming from a director that has proved successful throughout his career I am not too keen in romantic movies these days because i see them as old wine in a new bottle and so predictable However i have watched this movie three times nowand believe me its an awesome moviebr br VIVAH goes back to the traditional route displaying simple characters into a sensible and realistic story of the journey between engagement and marriage The movie entertains in all manners as it can be reflected to what we do or would do when it comes to marriage In that sense Sooraj R Barjatya has done his homework well and has depicted a very realistic story into a wellmade highly entertaining moviebr br Several sequences in this movie catch your interest immediately br br  When Shahid Kapoor comes to see the bride Amrita Rao  the way he tries to look at her without making it too obvious in front of his and her family The song Do Anjaane Ajnabi goes well with the mood of this scenebr br  The first conversation between Shahid and Amrita when he comes to see her  ie a shy Shahid not knowing exactly what to talk about but pulling of a decent conversation Also Amritas naive nature limited eyecontact shy characteristics and answering softly to Shahids questionsbr br  The emotional breakdown of Amrita and her uncle Alok Nath when she feeds him at Shahids party in the form of anothers daughterinlaw rather than her uncles beloved niecebr br Clearly the movie belongs to Amrita Rao all the way The actress portrays the role of Poonam with such conviction that you cannot imagine anybody else replacing her She looks beautiful throughout the whole movie and portrays an innocent and shy traditional girl perfectlybr br Shahid Kapoor performs brilliantly too He delivers a promising performance and shows that he is no less than Salman Khan when it comes to acting in a Sooraj R Barjatya film In fact Shahid and Amrita make a cute onscreen couple without a shadow of doubt Other characters  Alok Nath Excellent Anupam Kher Brilliant Mohan Joshi Very goodbr br On the whole VIVAH delivers what it promised a well made and realistic story of two families The movie has topnotch performances excellent story and great music to suit the film as well as being directed by the fabulous Sooraj R Barjatya Its a must see,positive
I was dreading taking my nephews to this movie as I didnt think it was going to be well done The kids ages 6 and 10 were set on seeing it so I caved I must admit that it was not nearly as bad as I had thought but was still a far cry from the book The movie seemed right on with the 10 year olds understanding and sense of humor I found that the 6 year old understood what was going on and he was presenting solutions to the issues that were taking place I eventually had to explain that sometimes the movies dont show the best solutions to the problems because it is more fun to watch what happens if they make the silly or stupid choices,negative

This film is a disaster from beginning to end 75 percent of the movie is made from scenes taken from HERCULES  THE HAUNTED WORLD and HERCULES  THE CAPTIVE WOMEN badly edited together with original scenes that do not add up to anything but a complete ripoff Im a big fan of those two movies and seeing scenes taken from them reedited and redubbed with nonsensical dialogue made my head spin These kind of cheap producers tactics to make more money by duping unsuspecting audiences basically killed the Sword  Sandal genre back in the 1960sbr br There is one memorable scene in the new footage and its the one when Hercules fights with the bad Hercules The fight is albeit cool and Giovanni Cianfriglia who plays Antaius definitely stands out He makes a memorable nemesis to Herc But the rest is borderline embarrassing that was probably shot in a daybr br Avoid at all cost,negative
My father insisted I should watch this film with him and I regret that I wasted my time watchingI want that approximate hour and a half back The funny little film concerns the elderly Don Ameche staying with his son Tom Selleck It turns out that Ameche isnt just forgetful like hes been told but has dementia it seems a lot like Alzheimers And because Dad is so frequently out to lunch he gets into so much trouble again and againalmost like the adorable tyke from BABYS DAY OUT The problem though is that you know BABYS DAY OUT is all fantasy and the baby is going to be fine Plus you arent laughing at the baby for having a deformity or illness But in this case you are being encouraged to laugh at a man who is slowly losing his mindand wheres the humor in that If this film had been more successful would the producers have then made films making fun or people with Cerebral Palsy or a Flesheating Virus There are a lot of people who should have felt ashamed at having made this film,negative
The 1986 TV movie of The Spirit was a pilot for a possible series However Spirit creator Will Eisner did not like the film and thus no series was produced I thought it was a very entertaining film and captured the spirit sorry of the comic with a modern twist Im sorry it didnt materialize into a series Sam Flash Gordon Jones was a perfect Spirit Nana Visitor was a nice Ellen Dolan and of course would later go on to Star TrekDeep Space Nine years later Maybe with the release of Frank Millers bigscreen version of The Spirit more people will be able to see this rare gem of Spirit history It seems that when Hollywood makes a film from an already established character or idea someone will inevitably seek out previous versions of the property and release it to video in order to make a few dollars When Antonio Banderas donned the mask of Zorro we were able to get earlier versions of the masked hero on DVD such as the great Alain Delon version of the 1970s although all copies I ever saw were badly edited Heres hoping someone will release the TV adventure of The Spirit to DVD soon,positive
It has very bad acting Bad story lines Bad characters You should never see this show If you see it on TURN IT OFF Or you be cringing for the next 30 minutes It should have never been aired Its not great You should never see it NEVER EVER EVER So now if you ever wanna watch this show please dont Turn to the THE CW for Smallville Or Disney Channel for Hannah Montana Wizards Of Waverly Place or Nick for Drake  Josh Those are much better family shows So believe me on this Ive watched it before and It is honestly and I say Honestly the worst show Ive ever seen and Ive seen a lot of TV So do me a favor and never watch this show,negative
This film must have been quietly released on some other side of the world perhaps even in English Hopefully nobody understood a word not theres anything to understand in this movie anyways Haahaa Call me a nut but I think this is one of the best movies ever Why would I come to that conclusion Because its my national pasttime to sabotage horrible films and this one begs for it every other minute Once I became a fan of Myster Science Theater 3000 I had no doubt in my mind theyd find it somewhere and use it Sure enough The version they acquired was entitled Cave Dwellers using some strange intro footage not even from the film itself apparently they were ashamed to use footage from their OWN film I cant say I recommend buying this film Rather I highly recommend getting the MST3K version Sure to find it most anywhere MST3K DVDs are sold dont miss out,positive

To be honest I didnt like that much this movie when I saw it for the first time But I guess the trouble is that I havent seen it in a theater Big Mistake  Because the 1 thing to see in Cliffhanger is the settings and 2 is the cinematography Try to see this movie on the largest TV possible and a great sound system The music is good and puts the movie to a higher level and a commercial potential The more I see it the more I like itbr br Its definitely one of Renny Harlins best movie THis guy knows about action Die Hard 2 The long kiss good bye etc And its particularly good in this movie The special effect are great and spectacular Stallone really needed that movie get back with success Still good to see him ,positive
The movie is about two stories one is a political murder of a callgirl the other an upperclass political party The crossing point is the public relation character played by Al Paccino as he is the witness of the crime and the instigator of the eveningbr br If the script is terrible without any decent dialogs and the directing void of any sense of drama the performance of Al is memorable how many fellows can be as much convincing as a powerful and feared man as The Godfather as here as a little servant see also Donnie Brascobr br Actually the big young lion has become a tired old one This passing of ages is very moving because it makes the audience ponders about getting old toobr br But his slowness is only a makeup because he can get back his energy in Church scenebr br Maybe it is a good thing that the movie is so awful because it put the starlight on Als talent,negative
I was totally engrossed in this film from the first to last minute It is brilliantly shot with lots of interesting and original camera angles and techniques employed The plot surrounds a deaf woman who is picked on by friends and colleagues alike She hires an assistant at work with her true intention being to find love Hes an excon and she takes advantage of him to wreak revenge on those who have hurt her In return she must help him with a heist that requires her lip reading skills to pull it off The film transcends into a dark film noir with a couple of truly excellent scenes and an even better finale The real beauty in this film comes from the way the director takes advantage of the leading characters disability The use of sound keeps the tension consistent and the dramatic shifts from silence to noise keeps the blood pumping thats for sure Throw in a little black comedy and undertones of erotic sexual repression youve got the makings of a great film Its the sort of film Hollywood really wants to make but just cant,positive
This is ten times better than Who Wants To BE A Super Model on Bravo I think it is more true to the business Tyra is strong and sensitive at the same time and is able to get the most out of each aspiring model The photos look for depth in each of the models in personality and beauty strength and demure attributes and the ability to endure and work for what they want I enjoy seeing Tyras personal experience brought into the photo shoots and on the runway I dont always agree with the judges decisions or Tyras comments and at least one of the winners I feel did not deserve to win But this is just a show and every girl on there is very lucky to have this chance,positive
I thought that The sentinel was going to be a mediocre movieWhen I finally saw itI took a good surpriseThe movie isnt great thing but its very fun and the action scenes are very well doneThis movie reminded me TV series like 24 or AliasIts very similar to that series and it reminded me tooto the Wolfgang Petersens thriller In the line of fireIf youre going to expect one of the most original and and one of the greatest thrillers in the history of moviesyou will be disappointedBut if you go with little expectationsyou will enjoy The sentinelbr br Rating7,positive
I dont have much to add to what has been said before but its very much a film of its time and the first and likely only time that the studio hung the film totally on the Dead End Kidsbr br The Warners gave the boys plenty of help from director Ray Enright and an A budget to an almost magical cast of supporting actors At every turn we get one of those gem performances from real pros They are too many to list but it seems like just about everybody on the Warners lot Sans the very biggest stars walk through this picture See if you can spot John Ridgelybr br The only over the top performance is from the always reliable Eduardo Cianelli as a mob boss with a messianistic complex He plays this character almost exactly like that of the Thuggie leader in Gunga Din Hes something to watch And Marjorie Main is excellent and gets her best role since Dead Endbr br My bid for this one is a second feature on a double bill with something like City for Conquestbr br Hooray for Warners,positive
Wow I do not think I have ever seen a movie with so many great actors that had such a pivotal role so miscast Justin Timberlake is perhaps the single worst actor to land a bigtime role in a movie with the star power and money behind it that Edison hadbr br His acting was PAINFUL to observe The story was OK and all the other characters were played by professional actors heck even LL Cool J was fine since he has had numerous small parts to cut his teeth on How the director and movie company figured that Timberlake was ready for this role there is no way to comprehendbr br His character ruins the entire experience since every time he is on screen you are actually rooting for the corrupt cops to cap his sorry ass and he is supposed to be the hero I would not waste money on this one at the theater or on video MAYBE if you have HBO and have NOTHING else to do at 2am on a Saturday night and you are drunk and stoned this may be OKbr br Watching Timberlake in this role was like watching a human Kermit the Frog act in a Hollywood Blockbuster just didnt work at all,negative
Being Of Cephallonian descent I was happily surprised when watching the movie I have heard the true history from my relatives that still live in Cephalonia but when watching the movie and reading the book the sketchy bits of history were filled It is all true the Italians would sing the oppression and the earthquakes that rock the island so often The earthquake in 1953 killed my great grandfather and the book and movie both portray the feeling of the era with great compassion If you havent seen the movie go and watch it and read the book it is not only a love story and yes there were plenty of Italians in love with Cephallonian women in fact boat loads of Cephallonian women were taken to Italy after the war it is a true depiction of history,positive
This is a great film From reading other reviews I can see that Im not the only one who shed a tear Tamilyn Tomita acted with such skill and conviction she made the ending heartfelt and memorable In the hands of a lesser actress her last scene would have seemed trite and corny One would never guess this film was done on a tight limited budget The cinematography is gorgeous and there are a number of big name actors The script is so wonderful I can see why they all wanted to be in it If you watch the long long list of credits at the end youll see that half of Hawaii pitched in to make this film happen and for good reason The soundtrack available on CD is absolutely beautiful and sets the mood throughout the film My only complaint is that I almost didnt want the film to end,positive
This is one of the most laughably bad films Ive ever seen I cannot believe whoever wrote the review above was serious Perhaps he was connected with making it It doesnt have anything going for it There is no suspense the acting is dire the direction hopeless The music score  is three trite notes played ad nauseam The plot  must have taken all of five minutes to write The dialogue is what a 10yearold would come up with if asked to do a homework project The only slightly redeeming feature is the actor playing the psycho himself who grimaces trembles and gurns magnificently and thus is amusing at times The only reason you would be on the edge of your seat would be if you were suffering from a weak bladder Dont waste your time,negative
A really bad sequel Part 1 had a lot of funny moments  part 2 is just bad in a boring way and obviously made to squeeze money out of the fansbr br Shame on you Otto Waalkesbr br The only slightly amusing moment in the film is Helge Schneider who apparently seems to be pised about the other characters Its quite easy to identify with himbr br The screenplay is sloppynonexistent The director should do everyone a favor and quit his job immediately The acting is worse than a 2nd grade school play br br Technically the movie is awful as well but who can blame the cinematographersound guys who had to work with such an untalented director,negative
not that all Disney films are garbagebr br Anyway I saw Legend of Boggy Creek first and absolutely loved the film When I heard it had 2 sequels I was ecstatic I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night I dont see how they can make a Grated sequel to a horror film The original is a moviedocumentary about the Fauke Monster and can scare anyone Return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone I dont remember the plot too well as its been quite some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again but Its about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill Bigfoot Three little kids sneek out of the house to stop them A big monsoon comes through The hunters get hurt are saved by the kids Then they all hide out in a boat with a big piece of tarp on top and try to wait out the storm Then all of a sudden Bigfoot comes and does something really sick I dont wanna ruin the ending for any of yas but its not scary Well,negative
This is one of the few movies I watched twice in the theatre I really love this movie for its atmosphere and its telling of the life of tragic hero Esteban Trueba He makes so many mistakes but gets a chance for redemption Isnt this a rather consoling thoughtbr br When I watched it for the first time I thought that after the won election the movie would be over  I didnt know the book So boy was I wrong when the dramatic climax was still to come I was literally swept away by the sheer power of the last half hour of the filmbr br Many people here utterly dislike this movie I cannot understand that one single bit Maybe those who read the book first are  as often with screen adaptations of novels  simply disappointed that so many things have remained untold unseen unexplained But as a movie telling a touching story  the story of a family the rise and fall of a man the deep compassion of a woman the strength of love and the insanity of hate and conservatism  this movie is simply splendid Furthermore the soundtrack is incredibly good and the cast is wonderful as well  especially Winona Ryder and Jeremy Ironsbr br So definitely one of those films that cinema was invented for,positive
Sistas in da hood Looking for revenge and bling bling Except da hood is a wild west town in the late 1800s I do not remember any westerns like this when I was growing up What would Randolph Scott say If he saw Lil Kim he might say Alright I have to admit that I tuned into this just to see her Bare midriffs and low cut blouses are not the staple of the usual cowboy flick but these are the cowgirls and they are finebr br Now dont go looking for any major story here and the usual stuff of ghetto crime drama are here in a different setting And whens the last time you heard John Wayne call someone Dawg And I dont remember the Earp brothers hugging and kissing before they marched to the OK Corralbr br I watch this on BET so I missed the action that got it an R rating but I doubt if I will buy the DVD to see it unless I can be assured it was Lil Kim in that action,negative
First off  theres absolutely no flirting going on in this film  with Anthony or anyone else These people dont flirt  they just do it Your first test of endurance is to wade through more than 15 minutes of intense violence and sexual perversion This wouldnt be so bad  hell I like violence and perversion as much as the next reviewer but without a context to put it in it is repellent So you make it through the torture and mayhem Then we meet Donna and the movie turns into something all together different  not better  just different a road picture without heart There are lame attempts at comedy thanks to cameos  broadly written and broadly played by broads like Judy Tenuta and Mink Stole and a few hookers and drag queens too They all deserve better The photography is purposely disorienting so if you get motion sickness or really ANY kind of sickness  this flick is not for you Come to think of it Im not sure just who this flick IS for except maybe gay and bisexual SM fans who like poorly scripted poorly shot indy films about themselves,negative
This is one of those movies you see in the video store that you just HAVE to get because it just looks so horribly bad And indeed we couldnt take most of it There was a lot of fastforwarding going onbr br But then we came across a scene where Robert Englund seduces the female protagonist her name somehow slips my mind at this time CRIPES Ive never watched a single scene from a film so many times Im estimating forty or so And Ive never laughed so hard in my life You see Englund has this thing for showing off his loins I last saw the film a couple months ago but I cant stop laughing as I type Anyway the scene is a montage of shots Englund ripping off the lingerie of the girl Englund riding a horse naked and some mysterious woman fellating a snakes head This is absolute genius Youve got to see it for yourself,negative
I had never heard of Dead Mans Bounty when I saw it at the DVD store a few weeks ago and I thought I had stumbled upon an unrecognized gem since it had Val Kilmer in it in a truly unique role Sadly it wasnt more than ten or fifteen minutes into the movie that I realized that this is a disaster of epic proportions The first clue you will see of how genuinely awful this movie is comes near the beginning when you have a bunch of dirtbags in an old saloon laughing like a bunch of hyenas in a scene that goes on about five times too long Its unbelievable how bad it is And sadly it doesnt get any betterbr br Val Kilmer is featured prominently on the movies cover box maybe to trick you into thinking that he has a role in the film but unfortunately his bizarre role as a dead man is overlooked in favor of focusing on a bunch of halfwit crooks and the most inept conceptualization of a unique town sheriff that Ive ever seen in a movie Hes played by Boguslaw Linda who is unable to or uninterested in covering his Polish accent immediately making it impossible that the movie is meant to take place in the American old west br br Does Poland have this type of frontier past I dont know My knowledge of Polish history is not my strong point but I can tell you this The Sheriff as he is known in the movie is the worst representation of law enforcement that I can ever remember seeing in a movie He is introduced in a truly ridiculous scene where he is wearing some kind of blindfold and a roomful of men take turns punching him in the face Before they start hitting him he explains that they can each hit him once and then after the first round they will each hit him again and if he can identify who is throwing the punches they lose What the hell is this crap I am completely at a loss to explain why a scene like this would ever be put into any movie br br Throughout the movie the Sheriff continues to appear more and more beaten and bruised and drunk and battered until ultimately he does nothing but show up occasionally stumbling on screen and mumbling notwithoutthe law You see there is a lot of talk and preparation for a hanging the details of which are as meaningless as the rest of the movie br br It takes place by the way in a town that consists of nothing more than two ramshackle wooden buildings facing each other across a flattened bit of dirt that is more of a path than a road My understanding is that it is a part of Poland that is supposed to look acceptably enough like the American southwest where none of the characters except maybe the dead guy could possibly have come frombr br I have heard that Val Kilmer accepted the role because he was intrigued by his unique role and also by director Uklanskis minimal use of dialogue in favor of a reliance on cleverly timed juxtaposition of images in unique visual montages br br Yeah whatever br br Seems to me that Kilimer was unable to overcome what must have been the truly satisfying feeling that he must have gotten when he was offered the role Personally I would really feel that I had reached quite some level of success if someone approached me and offered me probably a few hundred thousand dollars to come and lay still for a while I like to think that he didnt even read the script for this mess because if he did I am at a total loss to understand why he accepted the rolebr br At any rate the movie opens with a man bringing in the corpse of a man played by Kilmer seeking the reward Soon he finds himself embroiled in a ludicrous love story involving the town prostitute the alcoholic Sheriff and lots of mayhem involving a series of stupid stupid characters br br There is also a extensive and preposterous lack of understanding of American rituals In one scene a man cuts a cherry tomato in half and squishes the halves into Kilmers eyes for what reason I cant imagine and then later a man makes a short speech over Kilmers corpse in which he explains that he was one of the finest men we ever had and then he proceeds to lop his head off with a shovel What the HELL br br Not convinced yet Here are some more reasons not to watch it In one scene the Sheriff appears to be covered with ash except for the perfectly clean areas around his eyes and what can only possibly be described as bright red lipstick A man gets a head wound that drenches his head and body in blood In a daze he cauterizes it with gunpowder Smart Near the end the Sheriff appears to have a broken arm Sitting at the bar he puts a rope around his neck and connects it to his injured arm and uses his good arm to pull on the rope lifting his shaking beer glass in his bad arm to his mouth rather than using his good arm to drink Also smart br br Why doesnt he just use his good arm I have no idea That like everything else in the movie makes no sense whatsoever like the title Summer Love Are you kidding me Avoid this mess at all costs br br In the meantime heres something for the IMDb Goofs page  br br Errors made by characters possibly deliberate errors by the filmmakers  This movie got made HA,negative

I was pleasantly surprised with this one Its actually quite interesting and engaging The cast is strong even Dan Cortese Brooke Shields has come into her own as an actress Black and White must have really set her free cause I have never seen her in this much command playing a conventional character If marketed right could be a mediumsize hit,negative
Sadly this movie did have potential with such a willing cast but everything was so poorly thought out and poorly executed I dont think Ive ever seen any film where every scene just falls flat with a loud thud as it did here Also I dont think Ive ever seen a stoner sex comedy that didnt provide at least one laugh but this vortex of pain provided nothing but groans and misery The last time I was this stunned at how unfunny a comedy can be was with the awful Big Mommas House Scene after scene these movies will turn your brain into jelly Silly and stupid can sometimes be funny but here silly and stupid are used as a torture device against the viewer An absolute rockbottom dud,negative
Not an easy film to like at first with both the lead characters quite unlikeable but luckily the heart and soul of the film is Paula Sages touching performance which drives the film into uncharted waters and transcends the rather awkward storyline This gives the film a feeling of real truth and makes you think youve seen something special710,positive

This movie did attempt to capture the naive idealism that many young teenaged girls have for fun friendship escape danger sex maturity etc The problem was that it failed to establish these things on every single level which is why it failed to build a decent story around them I couldnt follow the point of any part of this story nor any reason why I should carebr br This movie is not an exploration into pedophilia at all Its basically about a girl being in love with her sister and her sister being in love with the idea of men While the latter tries out her love of men the former tries to win her sister back by getting evenbr br The plot is weak the characters are weak and the reality of it all was similar to an amateur porn filmmaker without the sexual substance,negative
WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHICH WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TRIPE br br Heres some good advise to anyone living in the UK Whenever Channel 5 has an old 80s comedy on late at night read a book instead I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure due to reading some of the comments on this film on here I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commies our borders I found this film dire in the utmost pretence maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny who knows But in all aspects this film is not just awful its teeth grindingly terriblebr br Ive never been a fan of Bill Murray and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him Dont get me wrong I loved Ghostbusters which was made only three years after this film But this just sums Bill Murray up really I can safely say that I havent wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here though these two films have more in common than you would think For 1 thing they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end and 2nd They are both riddled with cheesy Clichés throughoutbr br Heres one thing these guys are supposed to be in the US Army Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp Willy nilly seducing female Military Police Officers and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters Talk about Random This film is just terrible for this Im afraid Now dont get me wrong Im no feminist sympathiser but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them letting them go free Twice is just insulting to the female race The fact that one tatty haired fat lipped bum Winger and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MPs underwear to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrousbr br Then there is the training scenes where you get to meet the Squad Phycho who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff followed by the overweight bloke played by the late and great John Candy who claims he joined the army to avoid paying 400 for anger management classes Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the Giant Toe WTF Drill Seargent who honestly couldnt organise a pi up in a brewery let alone his band of recruits All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes with people saying way to go ass hole all the time etc etcbr br The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle peppering a watch tower with bullets Just like that Yep told you this film was randomHe miraculously escapes undisciplined as well Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours Bugger me Miracle Thanks to some wise words from Murray to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric General in front of the rest of the squads All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand who really shouldve been arresting them Everyone laughs it off though This bit is nothing short of amazing though He then chooses them to guard a new MultiMillion Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside claiming This is exactly what this Army needs rightobr br Then there is the dire finale where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this topsecret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany To which the Hapless Captain John Larroquette then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle To which they then take a wrong turn enroute and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia where they are captured Like we didnt see that coming Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray  Birds in hand to which is where a big fight loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up With them coming back as National Heroes humiliating the Russians by calling them pussies etc etc The end Thats right No Courts Martial nothing They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which couldve sparked WW3br br This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness I know its meant to be a Comedy it got all the right actors for it but where in the hell is it Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers and female Mud Wrestling like I said Random Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film of course This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year olds sadly we have to watch it instead 1 star out of 10  Total Tripe My advice do something a little more useful with your time Like Castrating yourself,negative

Following is an intriguing thriller that requires constant awareness to be completely understood The plot has many twists and uses displaced chronology The event sequence complicates following Following If you are willing to pay attention it is an exciting movie full of noir earmarks With the running time at 70 minutes there is a lot to take in but the fast pace helps to keep the viewer enthralledbr br Bill is a lonely untidy fellow who takes up shadowing people and seeing where they gowhat they do He is a bit too conspicuous however and eventually gets caught by a well dressed cleancut bloke named Cobb Cobb entangles Bill in a world the poor boy is not prepared to live in Cobb is a smart rogue who seems to have complete control over the other characters By the end of the film the disjointed story is explained thoroughly The film is an excellent first effort from the talented Christoper Nolan who would go on to make Memento one of the most original movies of our time,positive
SILVER CITY 2 outta 5 stars As a huge fan of John Sayles work for many years now I feel safe in saying that this is the worst movie he has ever done That said the movie isnt exactly terrible just very uninspired Sayles throws in familiar elements from his previous movies corrupt politics illegal immigration the selling out of youthful ideals but fails to bring them together in any new or meaningful way Even the dialogue usually Sayles strong point is disappointing this time around sounding clichéd and forced in almost every scene The movie looks and sounds like episodes from a TV series that didnt make it past its third episode There are tons of big stars on hand and they try their best to make their bit parts come alive but the material just isnt there this time around While filming a campaign spot a governorhopeful a poor and obvious George W Bush standin fishes a dead body out of a lake An investigator is hired to try and warn away people who may have deliberately set this up to discredit the candidate but he soon finds out that there are deeper and darker and more clichéd secrets to be discovered Sayles has made similarlythemed movies so much better in the past Lone Star Matewan Return of the Secaucus Seven Men With Guns Its a shame that he went to the well one time too many and came up with tainted water One good line delivered by Richard Dreyfuss Danny youre a loser Thats already been established beyond doubt So just try and be a good one okay,negative

My family truly enjoyed this movie As far as what this movie will do for Rugby in the USAwell I am sure that will be debatable But as for me and others around me I know that we were more curious about the sport after seeing the movie and I personally gained more respect for the game You may wonder how this possible especially since the movie does not dive in and explain Rugby But the simple fact is it drew you into the players and emotion of the game and life The film was inspirational as well as entertaining It made us laugh and cry The chemistry between Sean Astin Big Budah and Sean Faris worked well Some may think the movie is a little cliché but I seriously wish Hollywood made more movies like this I couldnt help drawing analogies of the game and lifes struggles At the end of it I found myself examining my own life to see what I needed to do better in order to be the best person I could be Honestly I was grateful this movie taught morals values and teamwork there is so much to the contrary After watching this I really hope my kids are coached by someone who has a philosophy like Coach Gelwix,positive
This movie is a shouldbe classic Its not perfect certainly The pacing while perfect for the stage is in movie form slow as a tortoise with arthritic knees Jean Seberg is misdirected to be too sweet and too gentle She fully shows enough acting talent skill and craft to convincingly play the clever passionate and confident Joan but unfortunately the director missed the point of the character George Bernard Shaw is my favorite playwright In no other play has his dialog been more sharp nor the lines more musical However processing this film requires that you look at it as a lawyer This movie is a case and the viewer is the judge That is how this picture is to be enjoyed 710,positive

Crush provides a combination of drama humor and such irony that I find the English establish very well when it concerns matters of the heart Mostly known for directing John McKay wrote this wonderful screenplay about three fortysomething friends in a small town in England All three professional women downout of luck with men formed a ritual ladies night gathering with gin fags and sweets intake included with endless chatter of their dates erroneous behavior or the needs of their libidos Andie MacDowell once again thrown by the surrounds of the British which is where I find she exudes the most is absolutely charming as the head mistress of a prestigious school who becomes involved with a younger man Small town gossip and the disapproving jealous friends great supporting cast conflicts with her relationship Unfolding a series of brutal unfortunate events and showing us the many difficulties when one is in pursuit of true happiness Keep in mind the main premise of this film is friendships and the ending shows us exactly that This is the type of film you either love or hate which is why I believe a lot of mix reviews and not that greatest success resulted when this film was released As Im sure most are just unearthing the film now I very much enjoyed this film and highly recommend for those in the likes of such films as Love Actually and Three Weddings and a funeral Not to mention the soundtrack is extraordinary perfectly capturing those crucial moments,positive

What is most striking about this semimusical set in 1920s Berlin is the marvelous cinematography and editing Its top of the line from First National in these departments The story is mildly engaging and similar to the plots of Millers other two films SUNNY SALLY where working girl is romanced by rich boy with family disapproval complications and final clinch All the four musical numbers are bunched at the beginning of the film and we go for a long stretch without any further musical buoyancy Miller sings parts of I THINK OF BABY and reprises BECAUSE OF YOU There are also DONT EVER BE BLUE and THOUGH YOURE NOT THE FIRST ONEbr br Miller here is very engaging and delightful quite reminiscent of Irene Dunne in manner and delivery Sad she does not dance as that is her forte SALLY remains her finest film with this trailing as second and the rather poor SUNNY a vastly inferior runner up Her life was tragically cut short by a sinus infection before the days when hospitals and antibiotics made such tragedies preventable Its worth visiting these films though to see Ziegfelds top star of the twenties,negative
Saboteur is a 1942 film partly aimed at getting American support for the war against Nazi Germany Propaganda or not its great entertainment The leading actors are Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane although director Alfred Hitchcock wanted Gary Cooper and Barbara Stanwyck in the roles which would have given the movie more stature This is a good movie anyway with Robert Cummings and Priscilla Lane bringing their own style to the characters As in other Hitchcock movies we see the directors disregard for the socially suave and the wellheeled He often portrayed spies and foreign agents as nice upperclass folk who at the same time sneered at democratic values and concepts such as guilty until proved innocent These upper crust traitors are the last the police pursue or even suspect Hitchcock had a lifelong distrust of the police He wanted to elevate the regular guy the bungler and the fellow who doesnt take himself too seriously One can see him wanting Gary Cooper as an icon in the Frank Capra mold Nevertheless Bob Cummings puts his own stamp on the boynextdoor and works well in the role Priscilla Lane as the spunky female lead comes off as the allAmerican girl who can handle herself quite nicely when put to the test Robert Cummings as defence plant worker Barry Kane is framed for a bombing that kills his best friend This leads to a crosscountry chase scene reminiscent of other Hitchcock heroes on the run Hitchcock repeats some of the wellestablished formulas from previous films  the reluctant female who is drawn into the action eg Madeleine Carroll in the 39 Steps and risking his life to evade the authorities who are on his heels We view scenes of America as Kane tries to find the real culprit in the bombing he stands accused of We see rivers bridges backwoods cabins truckers the Hoover Dam and finally New York City New York is a fitting backdrop for the climax as we go from Rockefeller Center to the ocean liners with a cut to the ship Normandy and the grand finale on the Statue of Liberty Great movie with uninterrupted action Dont miss it,positive
The best Modesty Blaise movie I have seen so far Its like a good pilot for a TVseries I even think its a little bit cult like with a lite touch of Quentin Tarantinos magic or something They have caught a great deal of Modestys character but I admit missing Willy Garwin a bit Even if i have read many comics and book by Peter Odonnell Im not disappointed of this film quite the opposite Positive surprised of this story about Modesty and her childhood I did not put my expectations so high because of the bad movie from 1966 So I may have overrate this movie just a little But if you like the comics and other storys about Modesty Blaise you should definitely see this one cant wait for a followup,positive
Having heard quite positive reviews and having seen the trailer I had to see this movie With William H Macy Luis Guzman Michael Jeter and Sam Rockwell present it had to be good And it delivered Overall the movie is not crackyouup funny but there is one scene that really stands out and is in a my eyes a classic SPOILER At the end where they break through the wall to get to the safe and we see Rockwell and Washington stare at Jeter is just fantastic This is just as good as the scene in The Big Lebowski where The Dude is using a chair to barricade his door but forgets the door turns outward END SPOILER Just go see this movie you wont be disappointed,positive
Alright so this episode makes fun of Al Gore Im sure it pisses a few liberals off The thing is South Park makes fun of everybody much like the Simpsons did If you get offended that a politician you like is made fun of then maybe you need a better sense of humor and are taking the show too seriously With that being said this episode is hilarious and one of the best Al Gores portrayal is hilarious Cartmans scheme goes terribly wrong and the results will have you rolling on the floor laughing It is basically everything you would ever want out of a south park episode and it is easily one of my favorites Ill wont comment too much further on the plot because I dont want to give anything away,positive
This movie starts slow then tapers off After watching for about an hour and seeing absolutely nothing happen I walked out I mean nothing happened Zero Zip Nada There is no story The characters are vague representations of the most boring people any of us know The producers of this film could be sued in a court of law if they try to sell it as a motion picture There is no motion I could have told the same story with a couple still pictures with captions The script is a joke Its just awful I doubt that any script doctor in the world could save it My biggest regret is not that I wasted 60 minutes of my life watching Love In the Time of Money but that I missed a great opportunity to be a leader I could have been the first to walk out but I waited a bit too long Instead I watched about 20 people walk out before me,negative
The thing that makes this movie so scary is the way that it portrays Andre and Calvin as relatively normal guys These are definitely not people who want to become professional filmmakers since they goof around in front of the camera forget scripted lines etc They are only making the video as a diary to show the survivors how normal their lives were Their parents just think the guys are filming for a family home video By researching other kids attacks on their schools Andre and Calvin learn what not to do and they inform usually in a silly This Old House kind of way any potential Andres and Calvins who might be watching this video how to make bombs get weapons and not get caught before Zero Day the day of the attack,positive
Although I have definitely read this particular Agatha Christie book at some point I didnt remember anything about it except the name Abernethie Which is a good thing because seeing this story unfold without knowing how it will play out allowed me to appreciate once more the sheer GENIUS of Agatha Christie the way she misleads you and then pulls the rug out from under your feet is the main reason for her success and timelessness In addition to her stories the excellent production values beautiful locations wonderful music topnotch acting elegant directing etc are the reasons for this series success and timelessness  and all those virtues are present in After the Funeral A word of advice be alert right from the start  there are clues dropped all over the place even in the opening sequence There are some quite unnerving moments as well in contrast to the peacefullooking Englishcountryside locations and some small touches of humor A mustsee for mystery buffs and just a very good film in general ,positive
Wow just wow There are a lot of reviews on this movie already but I wanted to add some comments of my own I agree with most reviewers who have said this movie has terrible acting writing and directing  whoo boy does it ever However I think there is some other problems herebr br 1 Why is Christian belief and the allowance for extraterrestrial life mutually exclusive The film acts as though you just cant be a Christian and also allow for the possibility Why They eversobriefly touch on this in the film ie The Bible doesnt say there is aliens Well the Bible doesnt say there isnt but the actual rebuttal is never answered The Bible really doesnt say there isnt So how about dealing with the question instead of dismissing it out of hand Or better yet acknowledge that this is an infinite universe we live in and if we believe in an infinite God there is the possibility that he made some other life somewhere and has his own plans for thembr br 2 How come the ONLY two explanations for the abductions that are valid are demons and hoax What about sleep paralysis and night terrors which have been linked to abduction experiences What if its something else entirely Too bad the film makers already have their minds made upbr br 3 The film makers claim that all who have had abduction experiences have had ties to the occult Thats a pretty big claim to make without any factual evidence to present Im not necessarily arguing that they dont but if youre going to say something so asinine youd better have the facts to back it upbr br 4 Why does the other reporter not the Greasy Haired Blonde Guy the other one always have his hands in his pockets Its hard to take someone seriously when theyre constantly playing pocket poolbr br I WISH this had been an exploration of Christian faith and UFO phenomena but unfortunately the film makers were too concerned with their Faith Message to care much about make a thought provoking movie As a Christian myself this saddens me,negative
My Comments for VIVAH  Its a charming idealistic love story starring Shahid Kapoor and Amrita Rao The film takes us back to small pleasures like the bride and bridegrooms families sleeping on the floor playing games together their friendly banter and mutual respect Vivah is about the sanctity of marriage and the importance of commitment between two individuals Yes the central romance is naively visualized But the sneakedin romantic moments between the tobemarried couple and their stubborn resistance to modern courtship games makes you crave for the idealism The film predictably concludes with the marriage and the groom on the wedding night tells his new bride who suffers from burn injuries Come let me do your dressingbr br V I V A H  showcases a lot of good things  beauty of arranged marriage beauty of Indian culture beauty of Indian woman last but not least a nice IDEALISM of the abouttobecouple waiting to get married  playing by the rules  Simple yet Beautiful Such a Simple story  no plot  no villain  as is the case with most of Sooraj Barjatya films Sooraj sir is back to what he does BEST He has made the movie with FULL CONVICTION Its a very sweet film  which teaches the current generation a lot of good things bout Arranged Marriage  the Union of 2 Families I think AMRITA RAO  looks very good  she has acted very well She has most of the good scenes  although i thought the last half hour was completely to Shahid Kapur  who for a change gives an awesomely restrained performance I also liked the acting of all others for ex the Choti ie Amrita Prakash Alok Nath Anupam Kher Shahids bro  sisinlaw It almost seemed as real and recognizable as it could Sooraj sir has got another nice family film to his credit after Maine Pyar Kiya HAHK  Hum Saath Saath Hain The chemistry between Shahid  Amrita is AWESOMEbr br Stuff like Sanctity in a MarriageRelationship Avoiding Courtship Mutual Respect Care  Space Waiting for getting Married officially PrayingSacrficing for Ur Beloved  all these and more get SHOWCASED in Vivah Theres still some good audience who r going  enjoying this film Some of the folksaudience are already excited after seeing that they r thinking bout ArrangedMarriage  Thats Success if you ask me it seems AMRITA RAO  our actressfromVivah Result for a nice performance has been bestowed the prestigious DADSAHEB PHALKE award for 2006  Hats off to her for this achievement Chalo even though Vivah  Shahid or Amrita didnt get any of the filmfare  other awards  least this is news to CHEER about  Congrats to AMRITA RAO for showing us a visual of Indian Bridetobe in the purest form and Of Course to Sooraj Barjatya for portraying her the best way  Shudnt forget Shahid Kapur and all others who make VIVAH as sweet and legendary as it is today  Imagine to share the same pedestal as the legendary Dilip Kumar  Its no mean achievement  Congrats to Amrita Rao  for taking her Career to another level with this award  I personally feel  she should keep doing movies only with Shahid Kapur  They make a cute couple and their onscreen chemistry reminds me of SRKKajol or Aamir Khan  Juhi Chawla  br br Some points that I observedfew of the elements  1 If u notice carefully Amrita Rao looks so good because shes always wearing traditional dresses She gives every bit of the Indian Woman essence  in this film  Perfect Fit 2 Shahid Kapur is like most of us  not exactly ready for marriage or earlymarriage  but PREM listens carefully to the stepwise talk given by his DAD  having full faith in Anupam Kher Eventually Honesty  Trust are the keywords that he reflects in his first talk with Amrita Most people would think such a first meeting with a total stranger plus for a limited time is never enough to judge a person But according to what I saw in this film I have a feeling  that Two people who are made for each other can connect within a 1st meet also Its possible  3 In the entire movie  there are basically 4 or 5 sequences where Shahid  Amrita are together  or shown to be together Its unlike most other romanticweddingbased movies where Hero  Heroine are always singingdancing or nowadays  doing cheap stuff But the beauty of each of these 5 sequences  Characterized by restraint innocence  respect for the other  4 I really liked the relationship shown between Chacha ALOK NATH  Amrita Rao These kinda movies should highlight the indifference shown to daughtersgirlkids in some parts of India 5 Romantic scenes between lead couple are shot very nicely  no cheap scenessongs are beautifully pictured  Words like Jalpraarthana etc are going to be buzzwords for all girls who liked this film  Personally I really am fond of many dialogs in this film 6 Last but not the least  The entire Hospital Scene where Shahid puts sindhoor to Amrita when shes struggling for Life  is terrific Those dialogs between the couple are so touching and U feel the LOVEIcantdowithoutU  Its a HatsOff feeling  br br  In many ways VIVAH reminded me of Maine Pyar Kiya DDLJ Qayamat Se Qayamat Tak Hum Dil De Chuke Sanam  for the freshnessonscreenchemistry of the LEAD pair    IF U ASK ME  Along with films like Rang De Basanti Lage Raho Munnabhai DOR CORPORATE and Kabul Express V I V A H ranks among the best films made in 2006 IN FACT  i think Vivah does deserve better viewingbusiness than Dhoom2 or Fanaa or Golmaal or all those timepassfuzzystylecrap movies ,positive
Oh my How can they make movies of such beauty but that are so terribly bad I mean even Uwe Boll doesnt make crap like this There is not even a hint of a decent story multilayered characters or attraction Its just a random sequence of pointless chatter joined together to make a movie I suppose only children up to 3 years of age could enjoy it given the world is so utterly dimensionless and the story so incoherent that anyone older would be annoyed by it But then again its far too scary for anyone under 6 years of age that theres probably no one that should watch this movie at allbr br Take my advice and stay far far away from this movie Your little daughter can make a better storyline and though she probably isnt able to draw pictures this pretty her tales are much more worth listening to And please in the name of whoever you believe in do not expose your children to this piece of  Ill give it 2 out of 10 and thats exclusively for the graphics because the story and character development are so awful theyd deserve a negative ratingbr br And if you decide to watch it anyways remember that I warned you,negative
I finally found a version of Persuasion that I like Anne doesnt look like a scullery maid in this version just a very thin aging pretty woman quite like shes described in the book Captain Wentworth doesnt look like hes 50 nor does he look perpetually angry but rather as hes described in the book he hasnt aged as much as Anne and is quite handsome And they play their parts with such conviction and realismthats what acting is all about They were believable They created real characters and it was like the characters in the book came to life If you havent seen this version I urge you to find it order it or request it from either a bookstore or a library if you must Its worth the price and worth the wait br br I watched the 1995 version and the 2007 version and this one towers over the other two Why it isnt rated higher is beyond my comprehension The book conveys the tenderness of their relationship and this movie makes the book come to life,positive

Firstly I would like to point out that people who have criticised this film have made some glaring errors Anything that has a rating below 610 is clearly utter nonsensebr br Creep is an absolutely fantastic film with amazing film effects The actors are highly believable the narrative thought provoking and the horror and graphical content extremely disturbing br br There is much mystique in this film Many questions arise as the audience are revealed to the strange and freakish creature that makes habitat in the dark rat ridden tunnels How was Craig created and what happened to himbr br A fantastic film with a large chill factor A film with so many unanswered questions and a film that needs to be appreciated along with others like 28 Days Later The Bunker Dog Soldiers and Deathwatchbr br Look forward to more of these fantastic films,positive
This anime seriously rocked my socks When the anime first opened itself I felt it was too slow the story wasnt quite moving forward and Shirou was quite an unimpressive male lead Once he learns more about tracing and you learn more about Saber and the Holy Grail War itself the story pans out and you can see multiple facets of it moving together It was fantasticbr br Additionally I felt that the way the characters developed was very true to form with the way real people develop in the real world There wasnt any stupid completely obvious things going on the development of Ilya and Rin was interesting to watch but I think the way Shirou and Saber grew in their certain personalities was just interesting to watch all on its on A few of the surprise people that show up Gilgamesh seemed to also be unique from the rest of the cast in one way or another meaning we didnt have Generic Badass A being replaced by Generic Badass B as soon as A diedbr br Anddd I loved the music The opening music rocked and the finishing theme from the final episode justSeriously pushed forward the theme of the last episode even more Good job TypeMOON,positive
There is a certain genius behind this movie I was laughing throughout The scene in the phone sex office discussing how love heals the doppelganger was a nice attempt at this geniushumor Execution is poor but you can see the writers message and they do have some talent The doppelganger split at the end was like ok wasnt quite expecting that but lets see what the movie has to say Certainly ridiculous but a sweet idea and actually very coherent to the story in a strange waybr br Is the point of a movie to be logical or is it to be entertaining or communicate on an emotional level im easily bored by many movies but this one kept my interest throughoutbr br I think the story may have some autobiographical roots but thats just a guess Horribly bad but good Im looking for other movies this person may have done with more experience,positive
This is a musical adaptation of Dickens Oliver Twist For the most part the original story has been maintained though for the flow of the film certain subplots such as the summer he spent recuperating and the halfbrother are omitted The biggest difference in the film and the story is that by the end of the book Fagin is hangedan ending very different from this musical filmbr br This is a one of a kind musicalone whose style and scope really hasnt been matched before or since Not only are the songs often quite singable and memorable but the choreography of the film is a sight to behold Whereas in most musicals a few people or perhaps even a small group are choreographed dancing here the numbers often run into the hundreds or perhaps more Its truly a sight to see and I was fortunate enough to have seen it in the theater when it debuted and is one of my earliest childhood memories Having just seen it again a few moments ago I would have to say that the film only got better over time Great sets wonderful acting and singingthis is a special treat that is hard not to lovebr br By the way when I saw the film again tonight I was surprised by just how high and feminine Mark Lesters singing was for the film Well according to IMDb his singing was dubbed by a girl and this would definitely account for his voice,positive
It is so nice to see Bruce Willis come down off his action throne and let us see that he really is a talented actor He shines in this film as the near40yearold image consultant who has totally lost touch with his inner childuntil he meets him face to face This is one of those rare films that doesnt talk down to its audience and truly offers something for the WHOLE family It is about caring for each other keeping some of the child inside you and realizing that you dont grow up exactly the way you thought you would Willis seems to be building an impressive track record for working with kids just witness The Sixth Sense with Haley Joel Osment and he has great chemistry with Spencer Breslin here There is some nice photography and music and the ending is wonderful and uplifting A great film to see with EVERY member of your family,positive
This film is a wonderfully simplistic work Enjoyable from start to end it is both sad yet uplifting at the same time The performances from Miranda Otto oh how she deserves so much more recognitionand George del Hoya are beautiful and yet almost painful to watch as the two tortured souls come to understand each other The supporting cast of workers at the Dead Letter Office are wonderful bitparts in them selves as is Alices longsuffering boyfriend who I couldnt help but feel slightly sorry for Theres one particular scene I could watch over and over and I have its such a shame that films like these dont get recognition and therefore bring them futher into the public eye for more people to enjoy I cried I laughed and I sighed Id recommend this film to anyone,positive
Highly memorable intelligent and suspenseful movie from one of French movies true geniuses the formidably able Henri Verneuil The plot is an exact parallel of the JFK assassination and takes place in a nondescript fictional country The film visually as well as plotwise is razorsharp Shot with meticulous precision it follows Henry Volnay the Procuror who takes on himself to unravel the coup In many ways its a very disturbing movie not the least for the cold and analytical precision of its comment on a socalled modern states inner workings The atmosphere and characters are all utterly believable and Verneuil left nothing to chance in its tight plotting On another level this relatively littleknown movie just had a 15 years headstart on Oliver Stone who was acclaimed for the JFK movie a inferior film in many areas the least of which not being credibilitybr br Its a masterpiece any cinema lover should see it preferably in its original French version with subs,positive

No Lifeforce is not a great moviebr br Its not a good moviebr br It is however an average movie with some good effects and a compelling storyline and of course Mathilda May It may actually be one of my favorite SFhorror flicks for the very simple reason that they try to reason their way through the science of the space vampires How often do you see that Not even in Alien the SFhorror flick of all time does science come into the story at all In Lifeforce they are trying to make reason of an unreasonable worldbr br Now do I think its successful No I think the movie has the issue of a massive ensemble cast that Hooper is straining to keep collected and on track and that the viewers have to focus on more than one villian and there are one too many road tripsbr br To be honest the movie is eye candy and fun to watch but there is great potential here for a superior remake to take a hold of what Hooper was trying to do and really create a strong scary SFhorror moviebr br If the remake does happen however I demand that Mathilda May have a cameo,positive
Being an unrelenting nonstop overthetop explosive melodrama this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced and utterly unbelievable in every way The pace is constantly feverpitched and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria It is nigh unwatchable and a stain  nay a blotch  on the careers of everyone involvedbr br The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself resulting in a movie where you just go Come on all the time The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously I can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10br br If you want to see a good asteroid movie see Deep Impact which is intense sensitive and thoroughly engrossing Everything Armageddon is not,negative
Take away all parts of the movie that were present day and stick to the flashbacks Then you would have had a great story Faith and Wolfs story and their relationship was the best part Diaz and Eccleston were wonderful Brewster was ponderous to sit through Surprised to see Blythe Danner as mom She was great Also look for Patrick Bergen as the father always like him Sleeping with the Enemy This is a very hippy save the world kind of film Dont care for it much but I recommend seeing it for Diazs performance alone She has excellent range and it should be used more Eccleston is as always compelling Hes wonderful,positive
We arrived at the theater too late to see Rendition which was our intention and The Comebacks was the only film that hadnt already started I had an inkling of how bad a film it was after reading the short blurb at the ticket counter The theater was empty when we arrived and only two other people entered before the film startedbr br The screenwriters and director threw every imaginable sports cliché at the audience without creating a single laugh not one during the entire movie Think of all the football movies that have been made and the millions of dollars schools and fans spend each year on football and you realize how ripe it is to be parodied or lampooned If you add Texas to the mixyou ought to come up with the sports version of Little Miss Sunshine not a big yawnbr br The first film that came to mind as we exited the theater was Cant Stop the Music By comparison this was Cant stop the Music without Bruce Jenner Valerie Perrine or the Village Peoplebr br If the film had a single grace note it was seeing Matthew Lawrence grown up,negative

I have loved this movie since I first saw it in 1979 Im still amazed at how accurately Kurt Russell portrays Elvis right down to how he moves and the expressions on his face Sometimes its scary how much he looks acts and talks like the real Elvis Thankfully this is being released on DVD so all of us that have been waiting can finally have an excellent quality version of the full length film I have heard the detractors who say that there are some inaccuracies or some things left out but I think that keeping in mind that John Carpenter only had about 2 12 hours to work with and that this was being shown on television just two years after Elviss death that he did a fine job with this In fact I havent seen another Elvis movie that even comes close to this one Highly recommended,positive
Dô desu ka den is the first colored movie of Master Akira Kurosawa and surprisingly is not about samurais ronins warlords or battlefields It is inside a very poor community in a slum in Tokyo where the dwellers are homeless drunkards beggars tramps abused women losers I do not know the reason why Kurosawa selected this tragic theme and environment to put colors but indeed they are very sad stories some of them heartbreaking I personally like the touching story of the boy and his father that dream with a house of their own and built by them the story of the retarded boy that believes he pilots a train the story of the man that raises five children as if they were their own sons and daughters and the story of the young woman abused by her stepfather My vote is ninebr br Title Brazil Dodeskaden  O Caminho da Vida Dodeskaden  The Way of the Life,positive

Interesting concept that just doesnt make it I watched the whole movie but had to read IMDb comments to find out what Code 46 meant Ifwhen it was explained in the film I must have been in a coma or possibly braindead by then I only watched it for Tim Robbins The fact that I did not know any of the other actors should have been a tipoff We all have to start somewhere but this film should not be it As to the anti empathy virus virusHoly Utility Belt Batman Where were The Joker The Riddler etc Also why are the women all so damned ugly If I want to see lessthanplain stickfigures Ill just walk down the street The best part of the film was the car crash It was totally believable and not overthetop like most movie crashes,negative
I just want to say that I am so glad somebody finally spilled the beans on this movie Bravo The Spaz Bravo This movie is a ridiculous farce of filmmaking Especially for a student film I just want to give credit to the Spazz for taking the absurd amount of time a care to find such a rare picture and then TO COMMENT ON IT Most people I know dont have that kind of time especially so few will end of reading it Kudos to you sir Anyway the movie follows a thin storyline that is at the least unbelievable and just plain silly I understand the idea behind creating a satire of Charlies Angels but why hire such atrocious actresses Also what kind of director has himself act write produce and also edit the picture Choose one job and put all your love into it man Its such a shame because I hear he made a good movie about a killer toothbrush Again thanks to the Spazz for pulling back the curtain on this film people like you are a rare find,positive
I was so excited to see this film because I had always heard it was very scarybr br Whats interesting about it is that it is a Japanese film they decided to bring to America but they actually filmed it IN japan with the original crew I think this made the film more Japanese which is probably why it managed to be fairly successful unlike most JapantoAmerica horror movie flops but it also made it a bit inaccessible to American audiences The difference in what scares the Japanese culture and what scares the American culture felt present throughout the film This worked well in moments when they meant to capture the nervous fear of the main character a frightened fish in a big busy unfamiliar Tokyo pondbr br The storyline was quite confusing as well In typical Japanese fashion it is extremely complicated and confusing The beginning of the movie is actually the middle of the story and from there we move constantly forwards and backwards until at the end of the film we see the ending and beginning of the whole story This constant flipping through time was very much confusing for me Also I didnt think some things were explained so well and I had to ask my friend to explain them to me she had already seen it as well as the sequel which apparently reveals more of the storybr br Overall there IS plenty for American audiences to love tons of freaky imagery and macabre details which a healthy splash of jump scenes,positive
dear god where do i begin this is bar none the best movie ive ever seen the camera angles are great but in my opinion the acting was the best why the script writers for this movie arent writing big budget films i will never understand another is the cast it is great this is the best ted raimi film out there for sure i know some of you out there are probably thinking no way he has plenty better but no your wrong raptor island is a work of art i hope it should have goten best movie of the year instead of that crappy movie Crash with a bunch of no names AND no raptors i believe this movie is truly the most wonderful thing EVER,positive
I admit the first time I watched Even Cowgirls Get the Blues I didnt think it was very memorable in any regard But now after viewing it the 7th time I admit that it has very much grown on me The characters of Sissy Ms Jellybean and the Countess have become very endearing And the romance between Sissy and Jellybean seems very sweet Though the plot is very weak I think the satirical humor more than makes up for it Then theres the kickass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented KD Lang who reminds me a little of Patsy Cline at her best I cant think of any movie that has grown on me after an inauspicious first impression as much as Cowgirls has,positive
This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time The director did a wonderful job showing the contrasts between social classes a situation that is very pertinent in France today All the characters are lovable especially Juliette and her family The development of the romance is while not entirely realistic at least plausible and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love I found this to be a heartwarming Cinderella story  but one in which Cinderella is a powerful woman in and of herself I laughed through this entire film and absolutely loved it I recommend Romuald et Juliette to anyone who enjoys unique characters comedy and nontraditional romance,positive
I really liked this movie Even though it wasnt anything like any of the books it still the that classic Nancy Drew style I had been seeing a lot of advertisements for this movie and since I was really into the Nancy Drew books I had really high expectations for this movie and they most definitely met those expectations Pretty much all of the characters were exactly how I pictured them from reading the books I am really happy that I saw this movie All of the actors and actresses really acted like they acted like in the book series Ever since I saw this movie I have wanted to read every single Nancy Drew book there is out there All of the actors and actresses really got into their characters and it definitely showed when the aired this movie on the big screen It definitely seemed like all of the actors and actresses were really in the positions that the characters were in I most definitely give this movie a 10 out of 10,positive
Besides the fact that this guy is a liar he is also a total idiot and a thief in the comedy community Once when I attempted to watch this excuse for a television show I believe i actually threw up in my mouth a little I cant help but feel a little bit dumber every time is see one of his horrid commercials while I am enjoying great comedy central programs like Reno 911 and American body shop It shows like this that make me worry about the continual existence of mankind Its hard to believe that even Joe Rogan can make someone look like an moron Please begin praying now that comedy central will realize their mistake and end this show as soon as possible Havent we suffered enough,negative
and I have seen a lot of films I saw this in the theatre in 1989 and to this day I remember the sickening urge to walk out If you like John Belushi respect his talent or even the sanctity of the cinema this film has nothing to offer you It is mostly a pathetic showcase for the writer of Belushis biography Bob Woodward As we see the progression of Belushis life pass on the screen Woodward actually shows up in the film like a ghost character The most offensive scene occurs when Belushi is dying looks up from his deathbed to see the author standing above him and he weakly utters Breathe for me Woodward There are too many terrible things to mention them all the least of which is the opening that has Belushi jumping out of his body bag in the morgue and getting into a taxi driven by a guy named Angel Ill leave it at that,negative
Beverly garland was born in the wrong time She was an actress ahead of her time bringing power and grace to even such lame flicks as the Corman films she starred in In Gunslinger shes the town sheriffs wife He gets offed so she takes over his job to pursue his killers Shes better than the material shes working with by far The movie is gray stilted and mostly boring Theres someunintentionalhumor with the tire tracks everywhere people running behind one building to emerge suddenly in front of another Ive heard of false fronts but this is ridiculous and the truly stupid plot line of the newly widowed sheriff falling in love with the guy hired to kill her Even if she hadnt loved her husband it had only been something like a week or two since hed died And she ends up shooting the guy to death in the end anyway No luck with men this onebr br The villain of the piece is another woman the saloon owner Shes scheming to buy up a bunch of land just in case the railroad goes through and makes her rich Her plan of action if it doesnt is pretty lameshell just steal as much from the town as she can and skedaddle Hell its just her and her hired gun at the end against an entire town Are you telling me these people arent armed Look what happened in real towns of the Old West when bank robbers came in to rob the bank then were cut down in a hail of bullets by the armed and dangerous town folkbr br Therea a lot of pointless talking and riding around interspersed with a few lame shoot outs The ending is as grim as usual in a Corman flick although thank goodness it lacks the moral proselytizing at the end that was in It Conquered the World The sheriff turns over her badge to Sam Bass and rides off into the sunset although the movie was so gray that you never saw the sun,negative
From actor and independent writerdirector John Cassavetes A Woman Under the Influence gives the viewer a look at a working class family with a problem of mental instability The husband Nick played by Peter Falk is a blue collar worker who has trouble showing his wife Mabel played by Gena Rowlands the amount of attention that she deserves From the onset of the film it is obvious that Mabel is very quirky and strange but only a few minutes later it is clear that she is much more than that Crazy Bonkers Out of her damn mind Nick tries his hardest to hide this from his coworkers and after she has a particularly strange incident at dinner he asks her if shell be okay as if hes trying to deny Mabels illness Her problem only spirals from therebr br I did find some particular problems with this film I guess these problems were mostly present in the story and the way some of the character acted toward the end Mabel has been committed because frankly shes nuts Then six months later shes ready to come out of the hospital and her husband throws a party to welcome her back He never acts stupid in the beginning of the movie Why would he invite all these people some of them strangers to Mabel over to his house when his wife is in such a fragile state Its simply idiotic Later after Mabel comes in the house Mabels father has a huge outburst at Nick screaming at the top of his lungs about not wanting to eat spaghetti His daughter has just gotten back from six months of rehabilitation and the thing you want to do is keep her calm and he goes nuts over spaghetti A few minutes later in the film Nick brings Mabel into the stairwell and forces her to do the things she did when she was mentally unstable make her weird noises and gestures Didnt he send her there to make her better and not do those things There were various other parts that occurred after this but it would just be redundant to look at them in more detail I guess I just had a serious problem with the decision by Cassavetes to have his characters act in this way It simply didnt make sensebr br However although I had problems with the ending of the film there was one aspect that really redeemed it the acting Gena Rowlands played an amazing crazy woman There were times when I forgot she was acting where I got so caught up in her wild gesticulations and crazy talk that I was actually scared of her She was amazingly convincing and intense However I was also impressed by the rest of Mabels family Peter Falk played a very strange character and I almost thought he was crazy himself because of the awkward way he handled his children his job and especially the situation with his wife I also usually dont appreciate child actors But the young people who played Nick and Mabels children in this film were phenomenal It really felt like they were Mabels children because they seemed so attached to her and were so interesting in helping her with her problem I think their performances are one of the things that kept this film together and without them it would have made the film less realistic and less intensebr br In general I wasnt impressed by this film The story was jumbled and unclear and the characters acted in ways that made me wonder who wasnt insane in the movie The only saving grace were brilliant lead acting roles of the Longhetti family Their realistic dialogue and powerful acting kept the film together and are probably the only reason the film has ever amounted to anything,negative
When I first watched this film I thought that it would be rally good because it featured my favourite actor of all time He gives a sterling performance though it is fairly obvious he didnt have to life more than half a finger to make the róle work He is the only good thing in it unlesss youre into explosions and American dreamworking class hero trash which Im not br br I dont get it How can this film get away with being so naf That bit with the little boy being rescued I mean come on You cant tell me that he would have been rescued without the fireguy wearing any goggles I know for a fact that it would have been pitch black in there and you cant see for more than a couple of feet infront of you and no breathing equipment hed have choked after 2 minutes This film was just bad OKbr br Why Robert WHYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYbr br Sorry if this is your favourite film,negative

For the record this film is intriguing but its hardly original Back in 1998 a movie starring Talia Shire called The Landlady had almost the exact same plot but with younger charactersbr br The story is Amanda Lear has had a bad life abusive father horny doctor mental homes etc Shes finally released from the happy home under the guidance of her perverted doctorwho she anally abuses and kills the poor guy now THAT was original The doctor had financed a mansion for her before she killed him and buried the sucker in the backyard After moving in she falls in love with a stud named Richard who just happens to be married to a blues singer If youve seen The Landlady you know the rest she kills or tries to kill anyone that gets in between her and Richard including a roadiebr br Much of the ideas came from the previous movie same idiot sidekick that sticks his nose in same spying on the guy with a bowl of popcorn same flying a bodypress It did have some original material the beer bottle thing was brutal The highlight of the movie was Amandas beautiful breasts in the hottop scene Somewhat of a ripoff but not a total waste of timebr br 4 out of 10,negative
One hilarious thing Ill say off the top is Im not the biggest Seisun Suzuki fan Ive actually seen a fair number of his works thanks to a retrospective the film festival had and I found his films just a wee too Yakuzadriven for my tastes So I went into Princess Raccoon wary of what I was going to see Boy Was I knocked out Raccoon is Suzukis attempt at a musical using the elements of Japanese opera mixed in with many modern elements both Audial and Visual Raccoon is a treat from start to finish The lead actor Joe Ogdari proves that hes one of the hottest actors in Japan these days in this role I have to admire that the younger Japanese actors still take roles that take place in Feudaltimes Japan dressing up in Samurai gear to full effect The story itself does get a bit confusing if you dont follow it really closely but even if you dont prepare yourself for the treasures that Princess Raccoon has,positive
I have to agree with what many of the other reviewers concluded A subject which could have been thoughtprovoking and shed light on a reversed doublestandard failed miserablybr br Rape being a crime of violence and forced abusive control the scenes here were for the most part pathetic It would have been a better idea to cover short glimpses of what was happening and let the audience imagine the deed And the victims laugh with the cops when he aborted his police complaint seemed as genuine as that of the cops No awkwardness no hesitance to merely join in I dont know if this was bad acting and or bad directing but someone missed the point entirely As for his halfaed supposed search for his attackers pathetic They should have skipped most of the sex scenes  another monumental failure in themselves and had him meet Colin Friels when he first went to the police The story could have then been drawn forth with good dialog and the occasional flashback  and saved by the superior acting and presence Colin Friels  the only reason I watched this movie  brings to any project he doesbr br The only concrete revelation of this movie is it was crap,negative
In Hazzard County Georgia cousins Bo and Luke Duke Scott Knoxville and their cousin Daisy Duke Jessica Simpson run moonshine made by their Uncle Jesse Willie Nelson while avoiding the local authority Boss Hog Burt Reynolds Their problems with the Boss are only beginning as they learn hes been plotting to strip mine the town for valuable ores found below itbr br I have never seen the TV show and after watching the movie Im not going to start any time soon I like stupid comedies but this one didnt offer many laughs It was a pretty dull picture with the first hour being really hard to sit through The second part was a little better but this film was still a missed opportunity The film focused on Bo and Luke way too much The characters in general werent very interesting and the actors portraying them didnt do a very good jobbr br The acting wasnt very good I wasnt expecting it to be good in the first place but none of the leads were very funny Seann William Scott and Johnny Knoxville both give below average performances The latter was pretty good as Stifler but he tries way too hard here The latter just seems to be looking for a paycheck and nothing else Jessica Simpson isnt known for her acting nor is she really known for her singing Shes famous for having her own reality show and for saying really dumb things She is pretty but shes a weak actor It doesnt matter though because she doesnt really appear in the movie and the character she plays isnt complex or anything Willie Nelson also has a minor role and he doesnt do anything specialbr br The screenplay was written by John OBrien and he made two films prior to the Dukes of Hazzard The first one was Cradle to the Grave which was okay The second one was Starsky and Hutch which was pretty funny He doesnt do a good job here though as the story is a mess He also forgot to add jokes and a few other things that would have made this film work better The movie is also pretty long for a comedy Okay 106 minutes isnt exactly long but it feels so much longer because theres very little humor in the first hour I think comedies should be kept short or else they have to find a lot of material to cover the entire running time The Dukes of Hazzard barely has enough funny gags to keep it going for thirty minutes let alone 106 minutes The car sequences were average and they dont save an already troubled film In the end Dukes of Hazzard may appeal to a few people but most people will probably find it dull and its better if you just skip it Rating 410,negative
It is unusual to see a film where the performance of a single actor is so good that one can feel that the film would be of little interest if any without his presencebr br Despite a not outstanding direction  in fact there are many scenes that seem to have been shooted too quickly and carelessly  a seemingly low budget a strange plot about a man who wants to take the place of a defrocked priest and another week points the presence of Pierre Fresnay is so impressive that one gets shocked from the very begining to the terrible endbr br I have never seen nor can iomagine for future a better performance even Paul Scofield acting in A man for all seasonsbr br Actually the end could be considered even ridiculous if Fresnay were not playing the transtorned priest who returns to Church by performing a crimebr br Je suis Maurice Morand prètre catholique I am Maurice Morand a catholic priestis said with such a brilliancy that one may forget the madness that conducted to that endbr br The other impressive thing this film has is a single scene in wich Morand  who despite being a defrocked one is stil a priest  consacrates in a cabaret a huge amount of vine turning it into Christs bloodbr br Gérard  the man that wants to return Morand to the Church or replace him by himself  has to drink it if he doesnt want to leave it in the cabaret He does so in mid of cheers and applauses from people who think that he is simply drinking three of four litters of vinebr br In next scene the dialoque between Morand and a garbage collector is also remarkable Do you carry away men too asks Morand who hates himself for what he has just done That would be too much work is the smart answerbr br The rest of the film is not worth commenting but it is certainly worth seeing due to the very strong and strangely emotive atmosphere created all the timebr br I think that Le défroqué is a very strange film but has to be seen by all viewers  if the are good catholiques it is mandatory  because it is a very rare jewell in film historybr br ,positive
The book is great Its one of my favorite books ever The film on the other hand is amazingly insipid and bad When I heard Damon would play Ripley I knew this production was doomed But I didnt expect it to be this bad The actors go around and act very showy Except for Law and even he is guilty of some showy acting all the actors here are near amateurish Speaking Italian and moving ones arms or hair about shouldnt be considered as acting Damon is miscast Hes way too stiff for a character thats supposed to be a chameleon Paltrow is forgettable and Hoffman plays yet another effeminate slimy character Talk about typecastingbr br Whats really unforgivable about the script written by the overrated director is that it completely forgoes every subtle details from the book and comes up with many of its own and none of them work The addition of the Jazz music stuff is totally WRONG I guess Minghellas idea of Italy in the late 50s early 60s is clouded with images of Chet Baker roaming the Italian countryside and spreading amore Yep Minghella is a true visionary The film is so bleeding obvious That silly scene when Ripley drives through the narrow street full of mirrors Very laughable Yes we get the point Every point or detail comes across a mile away so much so that the film might give the audience the false impression that they have psychic powers We know for example that the Blanchett character introduced at the beginning of the movie will return later on only complicate things And the soundtrack at times is totally inappropriate Whimsical when it shouldnt be The film goes on for too long and in all sorts of pointless directions There are too many boring characters populating the landscape many that werent in the book This film is bad Really badbr br Apparently Minghellas son told his father that the Ripley novel was his favorite Mr Minghella then proceeded to direct it as a favor of sorts to his son Well the director did achieve what he set out to do Talented Mr Ripley with its Hitchcock aspirations is a film strictly made for 12 year olds,negative
I had to watch this movie with my 5yearold He didnt laugh once during the entire movieand he loves dogs and will laugh at nearly anything This movie was horrible from all aspects poor script even accounting for a childrens Grated movie poor production the jittery camera shots made me feel nauseous for the first ten minutes poor acting perhaps they were directed to act cartoonish and even poor sound quality there are parts where the audio level seems fine then you cant hear what the next actor is saying Im willing to put up with quite a lot when it comes to watching a childs movie but this was worse than having a stick in my eye I also didnt like being battered over the head with the godheavenbelief thing In all it was the biggest waste of 90 minutes in my lifeand Ive done some serious timewasting in my day,negative
A SPECIAL DAY Ettore Scola  ItalyCanada 1977br br Every once in a while you come across a film that really touches a nerve This one offers a very simple premise almost flawlessly executed in every way and incredibly moving at the same time Its surprising Ettore Scolas Una giornate particulare is relatively unheralded even hated by some critics Time Out calls it rubbish and Leonard Maltin somewhat milder pleasant but trifling I disagree not only because this film is deeply moving but within its simple story it shows us more insights about daily life in fascist Italy than most films Ive seen The cinematography is distinctly unflashy even a bit bland and the storyline straightforward which might explain the films relative unpopularity Considering late 70s audiences werent exactly spoiled with great Italian films its even stranger this one didnt really catch on with the criticsbr br The film begins with a tenminute collage of archive footage from Hitlers visit to Italy on may 8th 1938 Set against this background we first meet Antonietta Loren a lonely loveridden housewife with six children in a roman apartment building One day when her Beo escapes she meets her neighbour Gabriele Mastroianni who seems to be only one in the building not attending the ceremonies He is wellmannered cultured and soon she is attracted to him During the whole film we hear the fascist rally from the radio of the concierge hollering through the courtyard Scola playfully uses the camera to make us part of the proceedings After the opening scene the camera swanks across the courtyard of the modernist hypermodern at the time apartment block seemingly searching for our main characters whom we havent met yet br br Marcello Mastrionani and Sophia Loren are unforgettable in the two leading roles all the more astonishing since they are cast completely against type Canadian born John Vernon plays Lorens husband but he is only on screen in the first and last scene I figure his voice must have been dubbed since hes not of Italian descent and never lived there to my knowledge so I cannot imagine he speaks Italian If his voice has been dubbed I didnt notice at all On the contrary hes completely believable as an Italian even more than the rest of the cast The story is simple but extremely effective the performances are outstanding the ending is just perfect and the framing doesnt come off as overly pretentious but works completely Dont miss out on this onebr br Camera Obscura  910,positive

The girls might be prettier if youre their accompanist or a faced onlooker What Im sayin is that itll take special circumstances for a nonwhince reaction to this effort The delivery of many lines appears to be distractingly unnatural for some actors Lighting seems to be a problem too although failing eyesight may have accounted for my frequent squinting And if you view this film be openminded enough to accept elements that no zoo or circus would reject They are the above and belowground creatures who feasted on dozens of campers near an empty Louisiana mansion Thats the discovery of a trio who is dispatched from their printed media to investigate the deaths Then two of THEM disappear and the survivor is part of another threesome who take up the hunt Eureka I just realized what one of those aforementioned special circumstances would be  unconsciousness,negative

There is something about true stories that makes them so much more interesting than fiction I guess it is the fact that truth has always been stranger than fiction The Falcon and the Snowman tells the true story about Christopher Boyce and his buddy Daulton Lee Boyce Hutton is a former alter boy and intellectual trying to find an occupation that can support and entertain him His FBI father is able to pull some strings and get his idealist son a job working in the defense department Boyce has few responsibilities and seems to be complacent drinking and goofing around with his coworkers However as time goes on Boyce starts to learn top secret information that causes him to doubt the morality of his government The idealist Boyce soon sees the illegal operations that the CIA is carrying out in above all places Australia Boyce eventually decides that he will leak some of the top secret info he is privy to to the KGB Of course Boyces mistake is the assumption that because the USA is doing bad things the USSR is the good guy Over time Boyce and his drugdealing buddy Lee Penn start to sell their top secret information to the KGB What was once idealism turns into capitalism and espionage The strength of this movie is the incredible performances by Hutton and Penn Although one of them starts off with the best intentions they will both soon find themselves in an unending downward spiral Great direction music everything Not only a great film but one of my alltime favorites,positive

First off anyone who thinks this sequel to William Friedkins The French Connection is superior is most definitely completely insane or moronic or both The problem with reviewing this film is that a its a sequel to a brilliant movie which always makes watching it objectively difficult and b its directed by John Frankenhimer one of the best American directors ever so I wanted to like it William Friendkin was the perfect person to direct a film about drug traffic in decaying new York city because of his documentarylike approach to the action and story Frankenhimer on the other hand is one of the most stylish directors ever ie The Manchurian Candidate and Seconds and with his French Connection 2 it feels like someone trying to be gritty and not having the true understanding to pull it off That fact that Frankenhimer was chosen to direct the sequel by Gene Hackman himself really tells a lot about Hackmans understanding about the original film too Its well known Hackman hated Friedkin on the set and vowed to never work with him again its also known he envisioned the character to be more one dimensional loosing weight and trying to play him like a straight character it shows you Hackman despite being a great actor had no idea who to make the movie and the story great The plot point of Doyle becoming an addict is interesting but doesnt warrant the rest of the film An unfortunate low point in Frankenhimers filmography,negative
AfterLife is about a somewhat arrogant reasonably wealthy man who discovers that his mother is dying and finds himself looking after his sister who has Downs Syndrome He cant be bothered with her and basically just wants to get her off his hands he has better things to do At one point he finds that he has to take her by car she doesnt like flying across the countrybr br If that all sounds familiar to you it is probably because you have seen Rainman a film far superior to its imitator AfterLife That it copies the basic premise heck it nicks a few characters and even scenes too is not the fundamental problem with the film The fundamental problem is that I did not care about these charactersbr br The brother Kenny Kevin McKidd is a bit of a womaniser He has a girlfriend who comes and goes in the story and who learns to like the Downs Syndrome sister again this is taken from Rainman He is a journalist trying to get an interview with a doctor who is facing a scandal When he ends up looking after Roberta the sister he doesnt have much time for her and sometimes leaves her alone for a little too long When she wanders off he becomes even angrier towards her Am I spoiling anything by saying that he becomes a nicer loving person by the end of the filmbr br Roberta is not determined to be normal she is normal and wishes people would stop treating her differently She is played by Paula Sage an actress who does have Downs Syndrome and her performance is easily the best thing about the film why did the screenwriter not explore her character more Well probably because that would mean the characters would get in the way of the story When we surely already know the story anyway didnt the filmmakers see the problem they were creatingbr br For a film about a dying mother and her handicapped daughter the father is absent I think he is dead but Im not sure it is surprising how little impact the film has on the emotions of the viewer The scenes are performed in such a standard dull way with such standard predictable dialogue that I found myself rolling my eyesbr br I have nothing against sentimentality in films but it only really works if you care about the characters Here the characters are so uninteresting and twodimensional that I didnt really think there was much to care about Rain Man has an emotional climax but that moved me because I cared about the charactersbr br Talking of climaxes this film has a stinker There is sequence at the end of the film that starts off as an unbelievable situation and ends up in even worse territory an unforgivably cruel trick is played on the audience The sequence is designed to move the audience but ends up being horribly manipulative and offending the intelligence of the viewer Audiences arent stupid and they know when the film is cheating What a cheap shotbr br There is not one scene in this film that has the impact it should There are a few sequences that are funny yes but when the characters talk to each other I can practically see the screenplay in front of me moving predictably and uninterestingly never hitting anything that touches the mind or the heart There are those phoney arguments that are reserved especially for the movies where the other character knows exactly what the reply is Why dont supposedly realistic films not realise that in real life anger can be irrational and sometimes people cant express their emotions and they might say things that dont make sense or not be able to say anything at all All of the actors in this film deserve better material This film is not based on fact but I think a documentary on a family with a Downs Syndrome member would be much more interesting That way we might have had truth and emotion For some reason the characters in this film think that an emotion only involves saying something loudly and making a suitable facial expressionbr br  out of 5,negative

I saw this film at the Toronto International Film Festival Not as salacious as it sounds this is a threepart documentary each episode is 50 minutes featuring Slovenian superstar philosopherpsychoanalyst Slavoj Zizek Zizek takes us on a journey through many classic films exploring themes of sexuality fantasy morality and mortality It was directed by Sophie Fiennes of the multitalented Fiennes clan shes sister to actors Ralph and Josephbr br I enjoyed this quite a bit although I think it will be even more enjoyable on DVD since there is such a stew of ideas to be digested Freudian and Lacanian analysis can be pretty heavy going and seeing the whole series all at once became a bit disorienting by the end of two and a half hours It didnt help that an illadvised coffee and possession of a bladder led me to some discomfort for the last hour or sobr br My only real issue with this is that Zizek picked films that were quite obviously filled with Freudian themes He spends quite a bit of time on the films of Hitchcock and David Lynch not exactly masters of subtlety I would have liked to see him try to support his theories by using a wider range of films although thats really just me saying Id like to see part four and five and sixbr br Zizek is very funny and part of the humour was watching him present what amounted to a lecture while inserting himself into the actual scenes from some of the films hes discussing So for instance we see him in a motorboat on his way to Bodega Bay from Hitchcocks The Birds or sitting in the basement of the Bates Motel from Psycho Which is not to say that his theories are not provocative Even when I found myself disagreeing with him it definitely made me think a little more deeply about the films Which is exactly what hes trying to accomplish,positive

this dolph lundgren vehicle is a fun die hard throwback action flick it isnt going to win any awards and its not very original but it delivers the goods you would want to see from a dolph lundgren movie our man dolph is an ex soldier who is now a teacher at a tough inner city high school and when it gets taken over by terrorists its up to him to save the day sure the script isnt going to win any Oscars its good fun and it has its fair share eplosive action dolph lundgren gives a good enough performance but he comes alive more in the action scenes and the rest of the cast are not the best actors but they hold it well all in all detention is an enjoyable action flick but youve seen it a million times before,positive
the worst sequel Ive ever seen really awful songs which is upsetting considering how fantastic the first films score and story is also which ruins the film for me is the fact there is no John Cleese so jean bob might as well not even be in it and the new villains are dreadful it is really annoying how that old woman type thing cant string a simple sentence together properly without repeating her words over and over and over again but to be fair Uberta not shutting up is a little bit funny but the fact it was her 50th birthday why do they draw her looking like an 80 year old i was going to give this a 1 but now i think i might give it a 2 but still the story line is no where near as good as the first film  it is similar without the humour from certain characters Overall i disliked this film entirely because of the disappointing music the severe lack of voice talent having changed the voice of prince Derek and jean bob the new villains disappointing storyline the annoying habits of some characters and the very simple animation,negative
I saw this film as a kid about 30 years ago and I havent forgotten it to this day I couldnt say whether its a good picture But in those days I instantly fell in love with Jean Simmons The memories concentrate on the very erotic feel of the movie but I still remember the plot Simmons was very young then and there is another film that gave me the same feeling David Leans GREAT EXPECTATIONS And again it was the young Jean Simmons Its a pity that BLUE LAGOON is not available on video Id like to correct my memories,positive
Father Hood is an entertaining tale of an unwilling Father who is definitely a HOOD Patrick Swayze plays Jack Charles who is a hood always on the lookout for the one big score that is going to put him on easy street His wife died while he was is prison and his two kids were put in foster care When he got out he thought they were probably better off in foster care  besides he still had to score his fortune His daughter Kathleen Charles played wonderfully by Sabrina Lloyd breaks out of a foster care institution that is abusing the kids and misappropriating money that is suppose to be being spent on the kids She hunts down her father tells him about how bad the place was and that her brother Eddie Charles played by Brian Bonsall  just a little 7yearold kid was being moved to the institution that she had just broken out of and convinces her father to kidnap him The three start off on an adventure across country all the while Jack keeps telling himself that he has to get rid of the kids Patrick Swayze is really good in this comedy playing a hood probably a little understatement for this criminal character who is similar to his Johnny Castle character of Dirty Dancing except Jack is appropriately funnier in this comedy and more optimistic than Johnny Castle Swayze is funny and rally does comedy pretty well Halle Berry plays Kathleen Mercer who is a reporter trying to get at the truth of the foster care system who becomes Sawyers ally Diane Ladd plays Rita the conartist mother of Jack Charles,positive
Advertised by channel seven in Australia as the untold story this miniseries undoes itself in the first five minutes by washing over the titular characters childhood and adolescence in less time than a good director will use to set up a single event This cowardice and selfcensorship for the fear of offending anyone permeates the series and is ultimately responsible for its failurebr br Robert Carlyle puts in a valiant performance as the most hated man of the twentieth century but he is hamstrung by two things The lack of a decent dialogue coach on the series leaves his NorthernUK heritage shining blindingly through his physical appearance and the dialogue is at times truly abysmal Apparently acknowledging the fact that Hitler was raised in a Catholic family is off limits but insulting millions of Vikings and their descendants by having Carlyle spew the most ridiculous lines about Valhalla is quite okay Well heres a clue for the writers  any person familiar with Viking mythology will tell you that Valhalla is about the embodiment of honour and might in battle two things that the Nazis quickly eschewed in favour of rat cunning and backstabbing Until we can wake up to ourselves and realise that the reason Hitler has never been excommunicated from the Catholic church is because it would require the embarassing acknowledgement that he was once a member we will never learn what this awful period of the worlds history has to teach usbr br So now that weve managed to insult Vikings and the citizens of Scandinavian countries in this sham youd think the series would stop there but it doesnt Stockard Channings listing in the opening credits was particularly eyebrowraising given that her voice is heard and her face seen for about thirty seconds at the most during the opening credits making it patently transparent that more footage of Hitlers early days were shot but not included because of a typical nannystate fear of offending someone It is also quite ironic that the films or miniseries which give a far better insight into Hilters character do not feature him at allbr br Until we learn to stop sugarcoating the truth and realise that the citizenry of Germany was mostly unopposed to Hitlers views and not necessarily through ignorance we will never learn to deal with the fact that subversions of democracy yes Germany was a democracy preHitler can occur anywhere we are doomed Thats the one thing this miniseries got right in portraying Unfortunately that element is lost in attempts to make Hitlers religious beliefs appear those of a much more valiant people and the inability to scratch past the surface in any part of the subject matter David Lettermans show had it pegged when they ran short satirical segments about the series They really might as well have made a family sitcom with him as the star thats how badly it was writtenbr br All in all this politically correct farce of a biopic is worth no points but I gave it two because Robert Carlyle definitely deserves better material than this and he is about the only thing in it that works,negative

Three young college women Simona Iva Krajnc Alja Tanja Potocnik and Zana Pia Zemljic go on an adventure canoing down the River Kolpa dividing their Slovenia from neighboring Croatia in this 2002 Slovenian film by Maya Weiss What could have been an Eastern European version of the wellknown and exciting 1972 Deliverance turned out for me to be utterly uninspiring with flat character portrayals that denied sympathetic identification with the charactersbr br Alja and Zana are not convincing as students at all though Alja expresses a desire to be a writer and both use what seemed to me to be excessive bad language Alja is bored with her boyfriend and seems to just be drifting along in life Zana even less scholarly is a selfabsorbed adventure seeker with an attraction to other women I had some sympathy with relatively innocent Simona conservative and starry eyed The very idea of these three traveling together just doesnt work for me The disdain that Zana and Alja show toward Simona makes no sense  why would they choose her as a travel companion to start with as surely they must know her demeanor and attitudesbr br The three begin a carefree journey down the river on two canoes undeterred by a news story of a womans disappearance along the river Things become more somber with the mysterious appearance sometimes real and sometimes possibly hallucinatory of a rabidly conservative fisherman politician Jonas Znidarsicbr br I did enjoy the scenes along the river and of small villages the trio visit It may be because of a lack of cultural understanding but the film didnt move me otherwise I was surprised to see that the film has won some awards,negative
Why Why Why on earth no one tells the truth about this horrible HORRIBLE movie I still wake up in the morning and ask God why He didnt stopped me from seeing this revolting comedy I cant believe I PAID to see this offense to my cinematographic taste Im starting to think that the 5 stars it has is because of Martha Higareda s nudity and all the men who cant buy a porn film and avoid seeing this  I will call it thing cause call it film is an insult to the Mexican film industry The characters are a huge cliché the acting causes involuntary laugh and the script is well I cant believe a human being wrote this And just when you thought youve been tortured enoughthe last half hour is so painful that I wished to ripped my eyes out The only good thing I can say about this abomination is that it only last 90 minutes that would feel like centuries but still Really AVOID THE PAIN,negative
I lived in Tokyo for 7 months Knowing the reality of long train commutes bike rides from the train station soup stands and other typical scenes depicted so well certainly added to my own appreciation for this film which I really really liked There are aspects of Japanese life in this film painted with vivid colors but you dont have to speak Japanese to enjoy this movie Director Suos tricks were subtle for the most part I found his highlighting the character called Tamako Tamura with a soft filter making her sublime a tiny bit contrived but most of the directors tricks were so gentle that I was fully pulled in and just danced with his characters Or cried Or laughed aloud Wonderful A,positive

Nice character development in a pretty cool milieu Being a male Im probably not qualified to totally understand it but they do a nice job of establishing the restrictive Victorian environment from the start It isnt as bleak as it really was and the treatment of women was probably even harsher What makes this go is a wonderful chemistry among the principal characters Each has their own thing that they contend with Once they come out of the rain and break out of the spider webs they begin to interact and slowly lose their sense of suspicion What I enjoyed about this movie is that it didnt go for cheap comedy when it could have It didnt try to pound a lesson into us The people who seem utterly without merit are really nicely developed human beings who get to see the light I did have a little trouble with the Alfred Molina character having such an epiphany so quickly but within this world it needed to happen Good acting all around with something positive taking place in the lives of some pretty good people,positive

Years ago when DARLING LILI played on TV it was always the pan and scan version which I hated and decided to wait and see the film in its proper widescreen format So when I saw an inexpensive DVD of this Julie AndrewsBlake Edwards opus I decided to purchase and watch it once and for allbr br Boy what a terrible film Its so bad and on so many levels that I really do not know where to start in describing where and when it goes so horribly wrong Looking at it now its obvious to any fans of movies that Blake Edwards created this star vehicle for his wife simply because so many other directors had struck gold with Andrews in musicals MARY POPPINS SOUND OF MUSIC THOROUGHLY MODERN MILLIE etc but also because Andrews was snubbed from starring in projects made famous on stage by Julie herself CAMELOT MY FAIR LADY etc because Hollywood thought she wasnt sexy or glamorous enough So Blake created this stillborn effort to showcase his wife in a bizarre concoction of spy storywar movieromanceslapstick comedymusical DARLING LILI suffers from multiple personalities never knowing who or what it is Some specific scenes are good or effective but as a whole it just doesnt work at all to a point of it being very embarrassingbr br Mind you the version on the DVD is the directors cut or in this case lets salvage whatever we can from this notorious box office flop In releasing the DVD Edwards cut 19 scenes 19 from the original bloated theatrical version into this more streamlined and yet remarkably ineffective version The film moves along with no idea of what it is We are 25 minutes into it and we still dont know whats going on or why were watching whats going What kind of spy is Lili How powerful is she Was she ever responsible for someones death Instead we watch a thoroughly bored looking Rock Hudson trying to woo a thoroughly bored looking Julie Andrews Things arent helped much with the inexplicable reason why the two fall in love Why does Julie fall for Hudson Why him and not other men she got involved with There should have been one of her ex hanging around trying to win her back or trying to decipher her secret This would have given us some much needed contrast to the muddled action It would also have given us some impetuous to the sluggish proceedings Theres no catalyst in this storybr br One only has to look at the cut scenes to clearly see that Edwards and the writer just came up with ideas inspired by Andrews and Edwards previous successes The best or worst example is the scene when Andrews and Hudson follows a group of children who sing in the middle of a forest Edwards channeling SOUND OF MUSIC Its no wonder he removed it from the DVD Back in 1970 that scene might have worked on a certain level but today that moment reeks of desperation There are other plot elements directly inspired by AndrewsEdwards other films The endless scenes of dogfights is inspired by the much better MODERN MILLIE The musical moment Ill give you three guesses was created just to make fun of Julies MARY POPPINS persona which is turned raunchy with Julie doing a striptease in the act The ending birds eye view of Julie running towards Hudsons plane is another wink at SOUND OF MUSICbr br The whole thing is confusing Julie plays a singer born from a German father and British mother who lives in England but sings her English songs in Paris You never know exactly where the story takes place Some moments are just badly edited Like when Julie and her uncle are on horseback They talk and talk and then Julie suddenly sprints off in midsentence Im like what happened herebr br The comedy bits are unfunny and cringeworthy Every scene with the French police are pathetic Wheres Peter Sellers when you really need him The action is stupid beyond belief When Julie and her uncle are on their way to Germany on that train Hudsons squadron shoots rounds of bullets at the train almost killing Lili in the process Brilliant Whats also funny about that scene is the two leave on the train in the middle of the night but Hudson and his squadron reach the train even though they fly off the next morning Thats one slow moving train there br br The musical moments The beginning is the best part of the entire film and the reason I gave this film 3 stars but its effect is diminished considerably because its repeated at the end Speaking of redundant did we really need to see a cancan dance Crepe Suzette stripping scene and Julie stripping too The Girl in no mans land is OK even if its bleeding obvious but that moment just doesnt make any sense whatsoever because Lili sings it to a group of injured soldiers at a French hospital making me wonder how many soldiers there were injured indirectly by the result of her spyingbr br The whole project is listless and without energy The romance is 100 unbelievable Rock Hudson is way too old and tired looking check out the museum scene Julie looks dazed like shes on Valium But what really kills this illconceived project is Julie playing a German spy Edwards desperately wanted to dispel the Mary Poppins syndrome afflicting his wife and believed that playing a traitor was a good career decision As much as I like Julie shes no Greta Garbo who pulled it off so beautifully in MATA HARI Funny enough even if Julie plays a German spy she still comes across as cloying and cutebr br How bad is DARLING LILI Even after 37 years since its release Blake Edwards felt he still needed to work on it for its DVD release,negative
I watched this movie with big expectations The blurb on the back indicated that this was going to be a nasty one But it was pretty tame and a little unsatisfying The violence was nothing I havent seen a thousand times before the gore level was only average mind you there was probably more than what has been seen in Hollywood in the last 5 years  perhaps more and at no stage was I even feeling uneasy let along frightened Again a CAT 3 movie with big wraps has not lived up to its hypebr br Sure hire this movie but dont go in with any expectations I am so keen to get into the whole Asian horror scene but am continuously disappointed I did love Ichi and Audition but then again Miike stands alone at the momentbr br Please inspire me there is a large cluster of jaded genre fans who are starved of quality horror,negative
Stan Laurel its been noted first made a real name for himself by appearing in short parodies of popular feature films in the 1920s He certainly demonstrates himself to be an excellent comic actor and performer here in Mud and Sand a parody of Rudolph Valntinos Blood and Sand but I think a film like this really works not because Laurel was a great satirist but because it allows the audience to jump into the comedy already familiar with the situation and scenes Laurel can then let loose with his inspired gags without either having to create context or to do without it I watched this the day after watching Blood and Sand itself it certainly enhanced the experience to know what was being parodied and wherebr br The scene where Laurels character Rhubarb Vaseline if you believe the title cards or Rhubarb Vaselino if you believe how his name gets written on the chalk board bilks his mother out of money with a twoforyou twoforme trick is funny on its own because its a great gag but its extra funny if the viewer is aware how it is taking the air out of Valentinos extravagant and melodramatic promises to give his mother any luxuries she desiresbr br This is the best Stan Laurel solo work Ive seen Its just plain funny  even more so if you have had a chance to see the source material,positive

I recently decided to revisit The Omen trilogy only to discover that insert demonic music here there is a fourth I didnt expect much from it and in that respect it certainly lived up to my expectations If youre into watching bad movies for a laugh then this just may be the movie for you Oh where do we startbr br From the onset the made for TV look and feel of the movie was obvious The music was often inappropriately matched with what was happening in the movie and therefore at best distracting The script had all the suspense of an 8 yearolds work of fiction But one thing that must be said is that the lacking script was very well matched up with the appalling acting Numerous scenes left me contemplating whether it was the script or the acting that was the source of ridiculousnessbr br The story itself is quite thin centering on all the crazy antics of the daughter of Damien Thorn adopted out by wrongdoing and badly acted nuns There is the usual lot of mysterious and convoluted deaths that personally made me yawn as the drama unfolded and the usual thirdparty investigator into the whole affair Later via some medical phenomena Damien Thorn Jnr is born And that pretty much wraps up the plot The whole thing is executed rather badly right from the beginning with the lack of suspense making the movie one monotonous andor ridiculous scene after another br br There were many WTF moments too that provides the unintended comedy relief For example whats with the major overreaction at the beginning of the movie when the baby scratches the mothers cheek Hardly a 360degreeheadturning omen I also laughed at the overreaction at the baptism The baby cries and everyone looks very concerned The distressed mother runs out of the church and the priest is left looking very alarmed while crossing himself Huh Then there is the newage nanny that seems to have carte blanche on exposing an 8 yearold to all kind of alternative spiritualism I laughed when the nanny suggested bringing the troubled Delia to a psychic fair to meet the nannys hippie friends and the mother just shrugs her shoulders and allows it Yeah thats groovy fill my troubled 8 year old daughters head with all this mysticism stuff Thats cool I dont need to be there Of course this would be expected from a mother who allows her daughter to adopt a fully grown Rottweiler they encounter on the street that could bite the little girls head off as a snack The entire scene at the psychic fair is quite comical in a slapstick kinda way from the horrified reactionary stares of the psychics to Delia to the ensuing infernobr br I also laughed at how the nuns death is considered a freak accident Here we have a religious zealot who is described as being part of a cult who is fanatically preaching in a pit full of rattlesnakes to prove how Gods Glory will protect them She antagonizes the snakes by handling them and SOMEHOW she is bitten several times Hardly a freak accident More like a successful suicide attempt br br The snakesvsnun scene wasnt the only comical death There is the slowspeed car accident resulting in decapitation in a school parking lot Then there is the slowmotion demolition ball headed straight for the detective I believe I may have gone and made a coffee when the slowmotion started only to come back to see the demolition ball still headed straight for the concerned detective Then there is the quintessential whoshotwho cliché death where a gun goes off and both act as if they have been shot for several seconds while exchanging horrified glances Then someone goes tumbling down the stairs revealing who the real victim was Additionally the death of the priest at the beginning of the movie seemed a little strange and pointless to me He runs around looking at the architecture of the church Obviously finding this quite distressing he eventually collapses clutching his chest and dies Apparently something demonic was happening as this is what the music was suggesting Ummm OK br br I am surprised that others have reviewed this film favorably and in particularly as a worthy sequel It is difficult not to notice the nonsensical script the unrealistic acting and the inappropriate musical score The movie lacks any suspense relying heavily on Delias demonic stare to provide a sense of horror which becomes rather annoying after a short time br br Bottom line  This is a bad movie with the only redeeming feature being its unintended potential for being a comedy,negative
In 1937 Darryl Zanuck who had recently moved from head of production at Warner Brothers was trying to get his newly created company 20th Century Fox off the ground and on a level playing field with his old bosses at Warners and the glitter palace at MGM This Is My Affair was an attempt to cash in on the current success of historical films set around the turn of the century San Francisco In Old Chicagoand in retrospect he succeeded quite mightily The plot is fascinating A trouble maker but heroic naval officer Robert Taylor is given a secret assignment by President McKinley to uncover a ring of bank robbers that are paralyzing American finance He finds the gang but falls in love with their female mascot Barbara Stanwyck and must decide between love and dutybr br Not everything about this vintage film works well but overall it is a good slice of studio filmmaking The plot gimmick would be borrowed by Kurt Vonnegut for Mother Night the lead role of that film of the book was played brilliantly by Nick Nolte and seems quite believable at least within the confides of studio make believe As a fan of old movies I am always thrilled when I stumble upon one that I have never seen and This is my Affair was no exception,positive

I really enjoyed this drama from Sidney Lumet The best word I could come up to describe it with is insane It throws the viewer around for an hour and fifty minutes and doesnt let you breathe until the credits start to roll at the very end Trust me this movie will keep you guessing the entire way throughbr br The story is very well crafted and almost brilliant Its almost like a more complicated Tarantino type story The acting is all amazing from all of the leads and even the small parts excellent cast I also loved the cinematography it gave it the real feeling as if it were an independent film It was all greatbr br This movie is excited exhausting and heartbreaking Its almost hard to watch but youll be glad that you did,positive
All the comments so far about this movie are negative but I have to say I found The Net engaging Few movies can keep me on the edge of my seat but this one did Another plus for it is that most actionsuspense films are full of language but this one had little profanity I found it an enjoyable movie to watch I am slightly biased though being a big Sandra Bullock fan wink,positive
The first episode set the bar quite high i thought It starred William Hurt as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker We are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all Returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business But he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters The special effects are good for a TV show and it becomes quite tense as he dodges around the apartment using his wits to survive sometimes getting the upper hand and other times not I wont spoil the ending but suffice to say it was a clever little twist This gave me hope for the rest of the series but i was in for a disappointment the other episodes were all rubbish and i lost interest by the fourth one Stephen King adaptations are always a mixed bag and these are no exception,negative
Paul Bettany did a great role as the tortured father whose favorite little girl dies tragically of disease For that he deserves all the credit However the movie was mostly about exactly that keeping the adventures of Darwin as he gathered data for his theories as incomplete stories told to children and skipping completely the disputes regarding his ideasbr br Two things bothered me terribly the soundtrack with its whiny sound practically shoving sadness down the throat of the viewer and the movie trailer showing some beautiful sceneries the theological musings of him and his wife and the enthusiasm of his best friends as they prepare for a battle against blind faith thus misrepresenting the movie completelybr br To put it bluntly if one were to remove the scenes of the movie trailer from the movie the result would be a non descript family drama about a little child dying and the hardships of her parents as a result Clearly not what I expected from a movie about Darwin albeit the movie was beautifully interpreted,positive
I thought this was an awesome movie The theme song is sweet  Anyway the only thing that somewhat bothered me was in the beginning when everything should have been normal It was very weird and unrealistic The big cable company is mainly what Im talking about Apart from that the movie was very creative I think that all the acting was well done the actors acted out their characters personalities perfectly Everything fit together well It really is a shame that their isnt a soundtrack That would have been great Because this is a Canadian film and because it is one of my favorites I give this movie a 10 out of 10,positive
The movie starts in Mexico where a girl has been cursed she spits on snakes thru green jello and her friend tries all these crazy spells to lift the curse He does nothing but chant horrible language that does nothing so they decide to cross the border get on the train to make their way to LA to see his uncle to lift the curse Comic hilarity ensues This movie has the same snakes over and over It has garden snakes and pythons that will never bite They all make the sound of rattlesnakes which makes no sense The whole movie has some funny lines some weak effects but most important a great ending that leaves you like WHAM BAM WHAT THE HECK JUST HAPPENED The whole movie is about a 1 but the ending is a 10 so by my crazy math it gets a 3 overall When blockbuster has nothing else you want grab this for mindless entertainment,negative
This was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks off The action will be nonstop and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated background story similar to the Animatrix This will put Vin Diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom He would be the most logical choice for the role Back to PB this movie even though it is a indie thriller it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more If they were to do books or comics it would be a great read There was one thing that I felt was a little under done The ending it needed a little work but not every movie will have the best ending,positive

Hardware Wars is a hilarious 12 minute short film parody of the original Star Wars movie which was released just a few months after Star Wars in 1977 This film uses household appliances as space ships and Star Wars lookalike actors to send you rolling around on the floor in uncontrollable fits of laughter This film has won many awards at film festivals and was the film which inspired Mel Brooks to write his Star Wars parody movie called Spaceballsbr br This is my favorite parody film and I recommend it to anyone who is familiar with Star Wars and has a good sense of humorbr br ,positive

When I typed Savage Intruder into the IMDbs search engine one of the options it came up with was Savage Garden International Video Collection The Story so Far 1999 the only reason I mention this is because Im a huge Savage Garden fan  you should do yourself a favour  check some of their music out like Affirmation or To the Moon and Back rather than bother with this average potboiler sorry I just wanted to say that Anyway Savage Intruder starts with a bizarre montage of what looks like MGM musical  premiere footage  a few spinning portraits which have no meaning whatsoever in the long run Its late 60s Hollywood  amid the glitz  glamour a serial killer is at work selecting ageing actresses killing them  dismembering their bodies A young man named Vic Valance David Garfield as John David Garfield hops off a tour bus looking for employment when it stops at the house of a now retired actress Katharine Parker Miriam Hopkins who was one of the biggest stars of the motion picture but now lives in a big house with an elderly housekeeper named Mildred Florence Lake a personal secretary Leslie Blair Gale Sondergaard  a young maid named Geta Virginia Wing Katharine has recently broken her foot  needs a personal assistant  gives Vic the job Slowly Vic charms his way into Katharines affections  more importantly her large wallet Vic starts to turn Katharine against the other employees but Vic isnt what he seems Vic is a drug addicted loon who gets Greta pregnant while still having sex with Katharine Greta threatens to tell Katharine  spoil Vics devious plans but she has a close encounter with an axe no one in the house is safe as Vic brings drugs sex rock n roll partys  gardening to the Parker mansion while his sinister plan starts to become more  more apparentbr br Written produced  directed by Donald Wolfe I thought Savage Intruder was a bit of a mess but a mildly entertaining one at the same time The script is all over the place  it cant really decide what it wants to be Savage Intruder suffers from an identity crisis The film starts with the discovery of a severed head  limbs straight after another woman Dorothy Kingston is killed by a mysterious unidentified figure but then it completely ditches the slasher film elements that it has just built up never going back to them Savage Intruder then becomes a sort of feel good film as Vic befriends Katharine  shows her how to enjoy life again  having an implied sexual relationship with her its actually disgusting to think about as shes old enough to be his Grandmother Katharine stops living the life of a recluse  gives up the alcohol as Vic appears to make her happy as they go to partys together  hold banquets for Katharines friend like she used too This part of Savage Intruder wouldnt look out of place in a Disney film Every so often the tedium of the feel good stuff is interrupted by Vic shooting up  having silly hallucinations about his Mother Sybelle Guardino  chopping her hand off with an axe he has sex with Great at one point as well Then after Greta has been murdered Savage Intruder becomes a bizarre horror film as Vic is revealed for the loony that he is Savage Intruder just doesnt flow properly as a film in my opinion as it mixes various genres with little success Similarly the murder mystery elements dont work  are frankly a bit of a puzzle why go to great lengths to conceal the killers identity during the murder scenes but then make it perfectly clear who is committing them throughout the rest of the film anyway Vic as a character didnt work for me either one moment hes a cool calm clever  devious con man  then next hes a stark raving loony Why kill all his other victims but with Katharine try to con her What makes her so different If it is because she has money why not go after her to start with So many questions  so few answers Some of the 60s dialogue is pretty funny to listen to these days like when Vic offers Greta a painkiller in reality hard drugs  Greta says what do I need a painkiller for Vic helpfully replies because your a pain wow this guy knows how to charm the ladies Or when Katharine suggests that Vic do some gardening  asks do you have green fingers he replies no but Im good at grass There isnt much gore in Savage Intruder some severed limbs  a couple of decapitated heads There is also a fairly impressive shot when someone has their hand cut off with an axe which is probably why its repeated three or four times The silly looking drug hallucination scenes need to be seen to be believed Technically Savage Intruder is OK the location filming in the grandiose mansion  Hollywood hills probably give it a better look than it deserves the acting is average as is the rest of the production Overall Id say Savage Intruder feels like it tries to be a murder mystery that unfortunately gives the killer away  as a result just doesnt work Its a mildly entertaining onetimewatch at best  a complete mess of a film at worse you decide which,negative
I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings 19691972 or not old enough to appreciate them I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through itbr br I was a youngster at the time of Apollo but I was old enough to understand what was going on The entire world followed the moon landings Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goingson each day from launch to landing from moonwalks to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitude of languages In school some classes were cancelled so we could watch the main events on TV During Apollo 13 the world prayed and held its collective breath as the men limped home to an uncertain fate You couldnt go anywhere without someone asking what the latest was The world was truly one community br br Now with a buffer of 30odd years after the fact it is easy to claim fraud because worldwide enthusiasm and interest has died down We are left with our history books and anybody can claim that history is wrong and attempt to prove it with a bunch of lies and madeup facts while completely ignoring the preponderance of evidence showing otherwisenot to mention the proof that dwells in the souls and memories of those who lived through these wonderfully heady and fantastic days,negative

This was such a funny movie which was soon forgotten about probably because there are so many teen and young adult comedies such as this The movie is not quit as predictable as one would think Crawl is an unattractive but fun and caring and most importantly a very devoted friend Still an unlikely match for Rebecca who has an attractive and seemingly kind boyfriend back home When he helps feel more at ease at school by showing her around the neighborhood and encouraging her to socialize more they become buddies but it is completely platonic When she realizes her boyfriend might propose she does not feel ready he seems to like her boyfriend but she seems to be enjoying her free laid back party life at college is not yet ready to live a life of marriage and responsibility You kind of learn what a good friend Crawl is when he tells her he will help get her out of getting married When her boyfriend proposes to her in front of the whole family she kicks Crawl and puts him on the spot He tells the whole family that he proposes to her and gives her his diamond ring which it tunrs out was his the whole time he must have come from money or something Well they never really show a close up of the ring The message of the movie seemed to be not to judge people by their looks and not to judge people before you get to know him Rebeccas boyfriend who her parents love turned mean when we find out he druged his new girlfriend after RebeccaAmber Thesan and Crawl so that Rebecca would have broken up with Crawl thinking they were a couple Although they were not Rebecca was mad at him which when you think about it was kind of unfair since they were not a couple but I think they were starting to like one another And I think she thought there was more The movie never showed them actually become a couple they left it open for the viewers to decide They never even actually kissed at any point although there was one part where they almost did That was one thing most viewers seemed to misunderstand Many people saw it and said that he would be a nightmare for fathers to see their daughters bring home or a shock but they were just friends the whole time even towards the end And she did not introduce him as her boyfriend still they never told her parents they were not engaged Rebecca almost did Even if he would never become her boyfriend they could have still been friends In the 90s for some reason femanin men were in and there was this big stereo type that woman liked femanin men not that there is anything wrong with that think it came from the fact that women like the kind sensitive type which Crawl proved to be through his friendship with Rebecca but when I saw the movie I must admit if I went for looks I thought I would have gone for the first boyfriend Still it was a creative movie that tried to teach a lesson on friendship and judging others,positive

George Sanders playing the Saint for the penultimate time does a good job out of a good script  with the usual good RKO cast around Its a nonCharteris story too bristling with murders and good clean funbr br Thread 1 In New York Police Inspector Fernack Templars friend is framed in a corruption scandal and disgraced  ST comes over from London to try to put things right Nice and simple so far  but is there really more than 90000 in the world Thread 2 Another tale of a woman taking revenge on the people who murdered her brother Wendy Barrie does well in bumping off some nasty men and having the Saint fall in love with her to boot Including a baddie who was under their direct protection and in Fernacks cellar  theres a creepy shot of him dead and staring and them in a car when theyre taking him back to where theyd got him Paul Guilfoyle as Pearly Gates must have supposed to have been homosexual in this  witness the dressing gown at the beginning and the later beguiling comment by ST that he was thinking of keeping him as a pet  and did too for Palm Springs Fernack was played by Jonathan Hale as usual but this time with such a beaten deflated attitude that what he really needed was a good slapping from Templar to liven him upbr br The Hays Office also made sure you got the picture right all threads are tied up with no straggly bits Well worth watching for all of us who like this kind of thing but if Val Kilmers version is your yardstick then dont bother,positive
Babyface  Notorious Barbara Stanwyck flick where she is told by the local professor type that she has power he tries to get her to read Nietzche she says books aint never done her no goodSoon we find out her father is basically pimping her out to a local politico and othersFinally she has had enough and relocates to the big cityWe follow her trail of men up the ladder of success in an international bankThe dialogue is quite saucy for its time and it was one the last films to come out before the self inflicted Hollywood production codeLook for a cameo by a young John Wayne as one of Stanwycks willing victimsPart of the Forbidden Hollywood collection  I watched the extended version the DVD has both versions plus RedHeaded Woman and Waterloo BridgeAn interesting movie and foreshadowing for future femme fatale roles that Stanwyck would play in the era of film noir B,positive

There is only one racist joke in this Daffy Duck short which is basically when Daffy rides Black Beauty it is a black woman I can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasnt even illegal to discriminate black people yetbr br Aside from this point A Coy Decoy is basically a fun interesting short where Daffy meets characters in books and does things in books I liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here The way Daffy is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at the same time Porky is a nice edition to the episode though it was not vital for him to be there The wolf is an example of how people thought of wolves in those days as well bloodthirsty terrible animals which of course they never really have been unless they are very hungry I also liked the style of animation used  and the theme of the episodebr br For people who are totally into Daffy Duck and for people who do not mind the occasional racist joke in cartoons enjoy A Coy Decoybr br Available on YouTube,positive

Oh it really really is Ive seen films that I disliked more due to whatever reason but never have I seen a film that just fails in every single aspect of film making It even fails to fail at film making in a Way the Hercules in New York could be said to do Its not the film I like the least but it is the very worst film Ive ever seenbr br The acting is the first thing that strikes you Ive never seen a worse acted film outside of pornography In fact Ive plenty of pornographic films that are acted a damn site better than this It really is awfulbr br Technically its terrible The camerawork is amateurish The editing is nonsensical I presume they couldnt afford proper sound equipment and this meant that every scene in a car and theres a lot of them has them driving at about three miles per hour and every scene set outside by the same patch of woods and theres a lot of them too is actually dubbed from a studio again lending more to the bad porn vibebr br The plot is nonsensical as many have pointed out Ill defend vampires walking in daylight by the fact that despite it being popularized by Nosferatu this was never originally an intrinsic part of the vampire mythosbr br Speaking of vampire mythos the writer had evidently read Carmilla or at very least seen The Vampire Lovers Im not sure how I feel about this swaying from impressed that a movie this dire has at least some aspirations to a Gothic novel Im very fond of or annoyed by its at best sledgehammer references and at worst total desecration of source material At very least the General is an insult to Peter Cushing thoughbr br It gets two stars however merely because I cant bring myself to vote one star for a film that has or at least purports to have both vampires and zombies in it Incidentally I watched Lifeforce another film that tenuously has vampires and zombies in it on the same day as this and despite being a rather flawed film itself really comes out a masterpiece compared to thisbr br So in the end this is not a film so bad its good or so bad its in any way enjoyable even drunk Its just a mess and worth noones time watching,negative
Unfortunately many great films on IMDb such as this one have their scores adjusted by IMDb This is truly a fine and intriguing film by the accomplished director of Bonnie and Clyde Little Big Man Night Moves Mickey One and The Chasebr br If you click in the user rating area youll see that the actual median for Four Friends is 76 However IMDb has adjusted dumbed down the rating to 64br br Per IMDb IMDb publishes weighted vote averages rather than raw data averages Various filters are applied to the raw data in order to eliminate and reduce attempts at vote stuffing by individuals more interested in changing the current rating of a movie than giving their true opinion of itThe exact methods we use will not be disclosed This should ensure that the policy remains effective In other words we wont disclose our methods so you cant question how we arrived at the score What a shame to see fine thoughtprovoking films like Four Friends fare no better than lame formulaic comedies due to IMDbs filters,positive

One of the most important artistic movements in the history of cinema was without a doubt German expressionism the highly atmospheric style of filmmaking developed during the 20s in Berlin Classic movies like Das Cabinet Des Dr Caligari 1920 and Nosferatu Eine Symphonie Des Grauens 1922 were the most famous direct results of this movement and while the movement didnt have a long life its enormous influence over cinema can still be felt today specially in the horror genre One of the key figures of this style would be director Paul Wegener director of 1920s Der Golem Wie Er in die Welt Kam as in his debut as a filmmaker seven years before the making of that classic he was already making experiments with expressionism in film That early prototype of German expressionism was incidentally another horror film Der Student Von Pragbr br Der Student Von Prag The Student of Prague is the story of Balduin Paul Wegener a student with the reputation of being the best fencer in Prague but who always find himself with financial troubles One day Balduin rescues the beautiful countess Margit Grete Berger from drowning in a lake after her horse drop her by accident Balduin falls immediately in love with her and tries to see her again but soon he discovers that hell have to compete with her rich cousin Graf Von Schwarzenberg Lothar Körner who also wants to marry her Knowing that he cant offer her much Balduin wishes to be wealthy and this is where a sorcerer named Scapinelli John Gottowt enters the scene Scapinelli offers Balduin infinite wealth in exchange of whatever he finds in his room Balduin accepts the proposal only to discover in horror that what Scapinelli wants is his reflection in the mirrorbr br Loosely inspired by Edgar Allan Poes short story William Wilson and the classic legend of Faust the story of Der Student Von Prag was conceived by German writer Hanns Heinz Ewers a master of horror literature and one of the first writers to consider scriptwriting as valid as any other form of literature Written at a time where cinema in Germany was still being developed as an art form Der Student Von Prag shows a real willingness to actually use cinema to tell a fully developed story beyond a camera trick or a series of scenes Like most of the scriptwriters of his time Ewers screenplay is still very influenced by theater although Der Student Von Prag begins to move away from that style While a bit poor on its character development specially on the supporting characters Ewers manages to create an interesting and complex protagonist in the person of Balduinbr br While Der Student Von Prag was Paul Wegeners directorial debut and Stellan Ryes second film as a filmmaker its very clear that these two pioneers had a very good idea of what cinema could do when done properly Giving great use to Guido Seebers cinematography the two young filmmakers create a powerful Gothic atmosphere that forecasts what the German filmmakers of the following decade would do Wegener would learn many of the techniques he would employ in his Golem series from Seeber and Rye Despite having very limited resources Rye and Wegener manage to create an amazing and very convincing for its time visual effect for the scenes with Balduins reflection played by Wegener too Already an experienced stage actor at the time of making this film Wegener directs the cast with great talent and also attempts to move away from the stagy style of previous filmmakersbr br As Balduin Paul Wegener is very effective and probably the best in the movie It certainly helps that his character is the only one fully developed by the writer but one cant deny that Wegener was very good in his role as the poor student who loses more than his mirror reflection in that contract John Gottowt plays the sinister Scapinelli with mysterious aura that suits the character like a glove Few is said about Scapinelli in the film but Gottowt makes sure to let us know that he is a force to be feared The rest of the main cast is less lucky with Grete Berger being pretty much average as countess Margit and Lothar Körner making a poor Graf Von Schwarzenberg However it must be said that Lyda Salmonova was pretty good in her expressive character and Fritz Weidemann made an excellent Baron WaldisSchwarzenberg showing the dignity that Lörners character should have hadbr br Considering the movies that were being done in those years in other countries and the fact that its remake made 13 years after this film is superior in every possible way its not difficult to understand why Der Student Von Prag hasnt stood the test of time as well as other early films The movies main problem is definitely its extremely low budget as it resulted in the film being considerably shorter than what Ewers story needed to be fully developed This makes the plot feel a bit too vague at times or even incomplete as if there was something missing in the narrative of course theres also the possibility that the existing print is really incomplete However Der Student Von Prag is a very interesting early attempt at a complex tale of horror and suspense in film that while inferior to what other filmmakers were doing at the time left a powerful impression in historybr br As the direct predecessor of the German expressionist movement its hard to deny the enormous importance that Der Student Von Prag has in the history of German cinema probably in the history of cinema in general It may look dated even for its time but considering the limited resources its director had its truly better than most films from that era As the movie that started Paul Wegeners career and with that German expressionism Der Student Von Prag is a must see for everyone interested in this slice of film history 710,positive
THE ODD COUPLE 3 outta 5 starsbr br Like most people I will always feel that Jack Klugman and Tony Randall are the definitive Odd Couple Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid70s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale Nonetheless how can you go wrong with a Jack LemmonWalter Matthau pairing Matthau is in especially good form as Oscar the slob Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as Felix particularly if you have previously seen Tony Randalls outstanding performance The script is good definitely Neil Simons best I will go on record here as stating that Neil Simon is probably one of the worst most overrated playwrights of American theatre The storyline is simple Felix a neat freak and newly separated from his wife moves in with Oscar the slob who needs some help saving money for alimony payments Their living arrangement becomes much like a marriage as well culminating in some amusing tiffs and spats Lots of fun and some great oneliners,positive

I think Gerards comments on the doc hit the nail on the head Interesting film but very long Its definitely the antithesis to the new school of flashy sexy Moorestyle docs There is no narrator no facts or side info interlaced and no other gimmicks What you see is what you get  a glimpse into the vanishing world of the Saltmen of Tibet As a huge doc fan I was surprised how much I lost attention with this film namely due to the length and lack of dialogue In the end though I would recommend it if the subject matter sounds interesting to you Its beautifully shot informative and presents a valuable and closing window into the way of life of the Tibetan saltmen and women   all important attributes of a good doc But do put on a big pot of coffee itll help,positive

Some of my favorite Laurel and Hardy films have very very little plot Instead they give them a rather mundane situation and just let them be hilarious Films such as HELP MATES and BUSY BODIES are among the funniest as you see the boys working or cleaning house Here in DIRTY WORK most of the film is akin to these other two filmsStan and Ollie are chimney sweeps and spend most of the film trying quite unsuccessfully to clean a crazy professors chimney Seeing Ollie fall through the chimney the boys making the house a total mess and the insane behaviors of Stanley all work together to make a very pleasing filmbr br However in an odd twist there is also a really weird subplot that begins and ends the movie It seems that the professor is truly a mad scientist and he is working on a formula to make things younger Late in the film you see him make a duck into a duckling and even a duckling into an egg Given that he then leaves the boys alone in the room is it any surprise what happens next While this subplot was unnecessary it worked well enough What worked exceptionally well was the middle portion Give the boys nothing exciting to do and youll be amazed at the hilarious results One of the teams better films and it almost earns a 9,positive

These are one of the movies that dont require any brain or thinking its a very funny time pass which you forgot in the next hour or so I was really surprised with John Abrahams acting he usually playing the gangster like character with the emotionless faceso from that to playing the complete opposite and does it successfullyby managing to shine amongst the comic geniuses such as Paresh Rawal and Akshaye Kumar I was also quite surprised with the Akshayes 3 girls because there roles dont require much talent but mostly moaning about Akshayes dissapearenceto the other girls i was surprised as they managed to establish and actual persona and you could differentiate between them which is a good thing also majority of songs are goodit is colourful and fun so on a boring Sunday evening this will sure lighten your mood,positive
this is one of the funnier films ive seen it had its crude moments but they were full of charm its Altmanesque screenplay brilliant physical humour and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch and a slice of life most of us can relate to and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for Steve Carells nipplei truly was surprisingly this is a goodnatured unabashed comedy that is essentially about love and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish and all of Steve Carells friends were flawed but amiable and so much fun the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a fortyyear old virgin but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first original charming and very funny highly recommended,positive

Overall this movie is dreadful and should have never been made One of the problems with this movie is that there is no link to the audience and the characters for example if she is about to be attacked you want to feel Oh My God No but you dont in this case you dont care because there is no link that has been made to know the character In the trailer it seemed as though the movie would be great yet there is no suspense what so ever really There could have been maybe some mystery but there is not All she has is a toolbox was said on the DVDs back you would think that it was carefully planned this movie and cleverly made but it is not The ending was just awful very straight forward and pointless too The acting is either average or below average maybe even lower In my opinion it was a waste of an hour of my life The Special Effects and sets were average too nothing special what so ever There is not much gore or bloody violence not much blood is shown This movie was advertised to make it sound quite amazing yet really its not even worth looking for I do not recommend this to anyone unless they are easily satisfied by a few fights and a boring story,negative
I have not read the novel though I understand that this is somewhat different from it the fact that I rather enjoyed this coupled with the fact that this really is not my genre leads me to the decision of not pursuing reading the book Having not read a single word of Austens writing I really cant compare this to any of her work What I can say is that almost every line of dialog in this is clever witty and welldelivered as well as the biggest source of comedy in this This made me laugh out loud a lot with perfect British and verbal material Every acting performance is spoton and Paltrow completely nails the role of a kind matchmaker The characters are wellwritten credible and consistent I did find a couple of them extremely irritating however and while I think that at least some of that was meant to be funny it tended to get repeated excessively and it honestly wasnt amusing the first time they appeared The editing and cinematography are marvelous and everything looks utterly gorgeous Plot and pacing are great youre never bored It does end in a really obvious manner but maybe thats what the audience of these prefer I cant claim that this did not entertain me it did from start to finish and Id watch it again There is brief language in this I recommend this to any fan of romance stories 710,positive
This programme bugs me There is no humour to it and is far too serious to be called fun Its just far too educational for my liking The characters are very stereotyped and unappealing The plots are redundant and the morals are just repeated over and over again Wheres the fun in it Also I feel this has been on the BBC for far too long and is broadcast way too much Does it really need to have a slot on TV every 2 or 3 months when a brand new show runs out of episodes I think its time that the BBC starting bringing back some of their older shows like Inspector Gadget Bananaman The Smurfs Snorks Moomins the Raccoons and Count Duckula other than continually giving contracts to these newer shows I thought the BBC where bring back Danger Mouse so whats going on with that 310,negative
I had been subjected to this movie for a relationship class in my school As figured it was nothing captivating and nothing new Though it tries to be original by focusing on the teen father instead of the mother showing the problems that the dad would go through It had an interesting side to it but it just doesnt live up to its originality due to the fact nothing else in this movie was original We have the main character who has the older sister who like in every other movie like this has a thing against him we have the stay at home mother who expects too much and when he gives more she feels offended and leaves him in the dust then we have the father who is always gone Then the girls side we have the parents who want everything and expect her to be perfect at all she does On to the story like I said it was interesting but the lack of good acting from the entire cast and the lack of any good writing or storytelling Everything about this fell into cliché the little nerd kid in school starts studying with girl they get together have sex and then boom we have a little kid Perhaps it couldve been better had the writing been well better and had the acting been improved Ive seriously gotten more emotion out of Leatherface and his chainsaw than I did out of any actor in this film and thats pretty bad seeing as the Leatherface movies are crap and horridly acted So far the only interesting teen pregnancy movie Ive seen was Juno So far the comical side of this serious situation has proved more entertaining while still giving the same message Like I said the idea was original most of these films focus on the teen mother but this one chose not to instead it focuses on the drama of the father but again the originality does not save this movie from mediocrity I really hope someone decides to either remake this movie with a better cast and a better writer or just make another similar film because this one was wasted potential,negative
I went to see this film last night at the National Film Theatre in London as a birthday treat It was the the first time Ive seen it and I think it has now overtaken the dreadful Twister as the worst film I have ever seen Disjointed for no reason self indulgent and full of imagery that oscillates from the crass and obvious to the obscure and unintelligible not particularly beautifully or grimily shot I really dont understand why this is considered classic gay or otherwise I normally enjoy films that push boundaries or even films that are hard to watch because of their length or unusual cinematography But this was truly truly awful,negative
Scott is right The best 2 person sword duel ever put on film is in the middle of this movie The sword fights with multiple fighters are not the best although quite good However the fight in the middle is the best even compared to Japanese samurai movies Chinese swordplay scenes in my opinion have never surpassed the Japanese in terms of entertainment value Especially in scenes where one guy must battle a group of enemies Japanese movies excel example being the Lone Wolf and Cub series Even though duels in Japanese cinema last only seconds or a minute at the most the sheer intensity of those moments made them better But this is one example where Chinese swordplay surpasses the Japanese The scene in the middle of this film was a five minute long fight with the most amazing choreography ever The other fights in this movie are good too but even if they sucked this movie would get a 7 for that one scene If you havent seen it you have to John Woo is the man,positive
Said to be inspired from Disneys The Little Mermaid Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is Japanese animation master Hayao Miyazakis next big work after the wellreceived Spirited Away in 2001 and Howls Moving Castle in 2004 In Ponyo his signature style of animating fantasy realms and children characters are on display once againbr br Sosuke Hiroki Doi the boy lead in the film discovers a goldfish trapped in a glass jar while playing by the seaside below the cliff He stays with his mum Lisa Tomoko Yamaguchi above and atop it Sosuke shakes the jar forcefully to try and get the goldfish out but the little goldfish is stuck He then tries to pull it out but it just cannot come loose Sosuke then place the jar on the ground before smashing a small rock onto it breaking it into pieces instantly while suffering a small cut on the finger He then checks inquisitively to see if the goldfish is still alive As he observes it the goldfish reacts by licking the blood off his finger suddenly Excited Sosuke quickly rushes back to the house and put the goldfish in a small bucket of water in hope that it will survive It did and he named it PonyoYuria Narabr br The above scene would signify what is to come for the remainder of the film It is of the interactions between Sosuke and Ponyo And it is one that Hayao Miyazaki did meticulously well in portraying He must have a keen sense of observation and understanding of how children behave before he depicts this chemistry of communication between the two main characters The behavior of the children would also extend into the rest of the film in their further encountersbr br The affection between Sosuke and Ponyo grew as the film progresses from the moment Sosuke brought Ponyo to school in Lisas car The best moment came when the two were reunited after a brief separation when Ponyos father Fujimoto George Tokoro a magical sea dweller recaptures the errant Ponyo before encapsulating her in a magic bubble with kind intentionbr br Fujimoto who was once human has grown to refer humans with disgust for polluting the sea and stealing its life But all Ponyo wants is to be human and be with Sosuke so for a second time she escapes accidentally emptying his fathers precious store of magical elixir into the sea creating a storm of tidal waves and engulfing the small town in the processbr br What follows are the adventures of Sosuke and Ponyo in the flooded townbr br Is there a happily ever after in this one Would true love prevail You find outbr br Looking at the art in Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea there appears to be a deviation from Miyazakis past works in terms of rendering It looks unfamiliar because the environment apart from the characters at play in every scene is not colored in the usual fashion as in Spirited Away 2001 and Howls Moving Castle 2004 The aesthetical appeal is discounted from what appears to be color penciled drawings The objects and characters are also not as detailed as beforebr br This is peculiar if taken on face value but from the way the story is written and told the possible explanation is that Miyazaki is allowing the audience to view the film with a childs tint yet allowing the adults to reminisce on a Japan when they were younger This move could have prevented prospective moviegoers new to Miyazakis work to see it The trailer did nothing to promote Ponyo as well Taking the case to Japan however would be a different story as Miyazakis credential far than exceed any marketing techniquebr br In summary though the whole did not equal to its parts Aside from Miyazakis ability to cast vivacious and animated characters the film lacks elements of thrill and wonder when measured against previous works resulting in a deficit of big screen presencebr br The sparks of Ponyo and Sosuke failed to light up the film in a big way but moments of warmth kindness and love can still be found in recognizing the film as one that is not made for the kids but of the kids who everyone is or once was,positive

I read a small ad in some horror magazine in the early nineties about Liebe des Totes the love of the dead or something similar This of course awoke my curiosity so I ordered Nekromantik 1  2 and Der Todesking The Death King The Nekromantik movies are Ok even kind of interesting and unique in their approach to the subject Necrophilia even if they obviously are horroropera entries rather than intended to invoke fear in the viewers mind they are actually quite funnybr br TODESKING on the other hand is in my opinion one of the best films ever made It consist of a series of scenes depicting the many facets of death Death as an enemy Death as a reliever Death as the very fysical decomposition of the body The film is a metaphor over life It shows how fragile life is and how short our lives are It reduces its viewers to the childs they we actually are The fact that we cannot really understand the nature of Death and hence neither the process of dying is the core message of the film This is a most realistic film Never does Buttgereit try to hide death behind white roses or whatever No matter what moral standards you set up death is unevitable and will sooner or later be not a fiction but YOUR reality This applies to YOU Dear Reader like it applies to the viewers of the film Some juvenile reviewers seem not to grasp this which is fully excused since they of course will live foreverbr br This is no exploitation movie Why Because death does not exploit us humans It harvests us We grow for seven days then we are brought back to the schopenhauerian state of prebirth that is Death Buttgereit gives us his version of the oldest of tales Whether you choose to regard it as optimistic or pessimistic is up to you At first glance it may seem very dark Consider though that in order for something to live something else must die Who wants to live foreverbr br I believe that when Buttgereit shows a body that are being consumed by maggots he shows not only decomposition but GENERATION of new life Is it not better to die and give life to maggots and then birds and eventually become soil than to remain the living dead zombie that is one of the the favorite pets of the genrebr br When you realize this you see Der Todesking it its right contextbr br Sieben Tage hat die Woche siebenmal letzte Stunden Seven are the days of week weak mortal  seven times the last hourbr br Dont fear the Reaper Buttgereit tells us because the Reaper takes only what is ripe And apples that are not plucked for food will rotbr br Have a good life fellow IMDBers br br And watch this film that compares only to Ingemar Bergmans The Seventh Seal in terms of depth and universality,positive
Hello again I have been thinking about this movie all my life I saw it when I was 5 years old in Los Angeles California in 1942 What a wonderful story of being good to one another kindness and charity You forget it is the bugs relating to one another It was just as if they were people I love this movie and so do my adult children Such beautiful color in this movieI need to see this movie again There is a story about an envelope in the movie that I just cant remember the why of itbr br Thanks for listening,positive

I had to watch this movie for a film class I suffered the whole time through I am not Asian but was still greatly offended by this film The films basis is racialism overall minorities Rex Harrison isnt even Asian are depicted in narrowminded manner The banning of the film in Thailand illustrates the degree inaccuracy and subjective portrayal of Asians In addition there has been critical attention given to Biography of Anna Many critics argue that Anna added many fictitious events to her story to project herself in a good manner Some critics of the film and biography have even stated that Anna made up the whole story An awful film but good for discussion of BioPics as form of metanarrative fiction rather than a work of nonfiction,negative

Due to rather dubious plate tectonics Japan starts to slip under the sea Initial predictions say itll take about 40 years before the country is submerged but a rogue scientist adds in some even more dubious science and determines it will actually take less than 1 year The government think hes a crackpot but evidence soon starts bearing his theory outbr br This big budget disaster movie follows the formula set by any number of Hollywood films of the late 90s I assume having seen none of them with the scale of disaster and tragedy bringing out the nobility of the human well Japanese spirit in acts of heroism and sacrifice and proving the power of love or something like that ie its as naive in its psychology as its geology we all know that half the populace would be out raping and looting the minute they thought the police had their back turned and the other half would just panic and be uselessbr br The film does have some very nice special effects but is not as slick or expensive looking as an equivalent Hollywood production would be It is at least as nationalistic humourless and lacking in selfawareness as that Hollywood film would be though and probably has even worse acting It does have the hot evil chick from Battle Royale as one of the leads but shes not even slightly evil and is therefore much less hotbr br The film is much too long at 132 minutes and gets worse and worse as it progresses towards a conclusion that had me in danger of puking I certainly didnt care in the slightest whether Japan sank or not by the half way point and well before the end I was trying to think of ways to expedite the process should I ever find myself in that situation for realbr br But it does have nice special effects and Kou Shibasaki is still pretty hot so I magnanimously give it 310,negative
Amateurism best describes the film adaptation of the bestselling philosophical novel The Celestine Prophecy which follows the spiritual awakening of an out of work teacher in a mysterious village in Peru Home video quality actors present socalled characters spewing overwrought exposition and metaphysical hokum while the film is propelled by the extremely heavyhanded direction of Armand Mastroianni Even though there are visible attempts at measuring up to and interesting fans of stronger fare in the vain of ABCs Lost or Dan Browns The Da Vinci Code the filmmakers are hardly up to the task This film reeks of illconceived mass consumption spiritual propaganda and the results are so awful few can wade through this mess to spot a real point,negative

Asia Argento has never done a film so far as I know and this includes ones directed by her own father Dario where she fails to show all of her anatomy at some point Sure enough in the most boring opening dialogue scene ever poor Madsen has her coming into his office and right there reminding us that even though her hair is up she can still stick her fingers in her crotch at any given second which she does but in such a random what am I really seeing that kind of way The DVD box packaging makes this look like a femme fatale film so you keep waiting to see her turn into a sleek and minimalist killer no such luck Shes verbose hung up on some aging has been and even worse has no credible skills in physical agility other than surprise taking off ALL the clothes when any scene allows it Her accented English would be cool if only she didnt try to make it sound so affected and try to talk like a 12 year old How about this plot Weakminded but simultaneously nymphomaniacal woman is suddenly driven to kill while she already has another affair on the go and is running some cheap drug deal  huh what does anyone have motivation in this movie to do anything other than buy a hamster The screenplay seems to be oriented by letting everyone talk a lot about the same things over and over I was expecting to see the worst acting on this appear as a producer who dumped money in it just to have some screen time  there is nothing going on sub the obvious flaws of Asias character that at any point in the movie delivers what the DVD cover promises Shes weak but she knows how to kill she flails A LOT She flails naked she flails half dressed she even flails in a dead womans clothing she is very floppy and unmotivated In fact Floppy would have been a great name for this movie and a shot of Asia passed out looking angry on the cover would have been a better representation  there are actually shots of her eating airplane food Whats that about br br THe ending makes 0 sense  everyone is just annoyingly wishy washy in their intent and their execution of all objectives The wife of Lester doesnt deliver any REAL vengeance taking someone to bad karoeke IS life threatening but not really valid and Lester just floats around without really making much proclaimation of anything Totally misleading key art yeah we know Asia lost the baby fat of her first born but really a whole movie trying to pretend like thats interesting enough to drive a film about a passiveaggressive chick is not worth your while See Point of No Return instead,negative
I would just like to say that The Cure was a fabulious movie to help inform how people who are HIV positive have to function in life Expecially a young boy who cant go to school because he could contaminate someone and the ignorance of the boys who called them FAGGOTS that just shows how much children are not educated about aids,positive
When you watch a Seagal movie you expect good action You expect fighting not just a lot of shooting like in this flick And you expect a rather simple story OK I can live with a more complex story even though its a Seagal movie But this one this is I dont know what to say Its very very confusing indeed At the end of the movie I had major problems figuring out what had happened And I know Im not the only one The story lacks so much information and is so full of plot holes that its nearly impossible to keep track of whats happening in the movie There are many people in the movie people change sides all the time and it switches locations too often Terrible I just dont understand why it looks like Seagal is making a sort of sequel to this one,negative

It takes a Serbian or at least a Balkan familiarity to understand and enjoy many of the situations characters and jokes of Zavet as well as of many other films of Kusturica See for example the opening scenes with the remote village in the Serbian mountains with the lowtech devices that defend the integrity and way of life of the inhabitants the nostalgia for the good days of the Communist rule and the awakening of the young brat watching his nude teacher at the sounds of the Soviet hymn Kusturica not only tries to depart from the tragic history of Serbia described in his previous movies but creates a whole world of himself in the processbr br This is not a political film or not an explicit political film in any case Its a fun film before all Kusturica creates a set of characters that we care about Music plays an active role in this film same as in all his other movies His style is direct and grotesque we now what he feels about his characters and we know that he wants us to feel the same The space he develops melds present history and magic and the colours seem to be of a Douanier Rousseau of modern cinemabr br This is not a perfect film either The principal flaw is the length some editing and shortening would have been useful as at some point in time the director seems to have run out of ideas and repetitions show up It is yet one of the most catching amusing moving films that I have seen lately,positive
This is one of the worst movies I have ever seen There is not a shred of historical accuracy in fact reality is reversed Just one example Morgan preyed on the few ethnic Chinese he encountered The acting is over the top the script is a poorly written lie I have never seen worse fake beardsbr br Hopper arrived in Australia and reportedly only would make the film if the script was totally rewritten so he could be a hero Since the script was ten made up on the fly the may explain how bad it is and how disjointed the movie isbr br Any movie about Ned Kelly is a lot better than this film,negative
I went to see this film with low expectations but hoping to be charmed by seeing my home town on film Sadly thats about all I got The story covers familiar territory the high school reunion but the plot is convoluted and supernatural element adds little to this wellworn theme Though the quality of the acting was good overall the content of the film was appalling The sexism of the film was blatantwomen are apparently unfulfilled unless they are married procreating or both though this was couched as a postfeminist choice  Worse still was the racismthe shrill Jewish mother the black man who still lives at home and gratuitous cruelty tormenting the class geek We should be ashamed if these characters are thought to represent the inhabitants of the city of Kalamazoo and the writers should be abashed at having brought such broad and cruel stereotypes to the screen,negative
This happened to be just starting on TV when I opened it and as I felt too lazy to change the channel I ended up watching it Man was that fortunatebr br This film is more of a fairy tale than a demanding drama and at times openly sentimental one It is definitely what one could call a feelgood movie and I usually find such either boring or irritating Yet this film is so very well done I could not help but love it The script will not twist your brain it is conventional but flawless The actors are brilliant every single one is a perfect fit for the role There is not much of a score but the bits of music enhance the movie beautifullybr br If you can appreciate other things than expensive pyrotechnics vicious murders or saving the world in a movie do watch this if you ever have the chance 55,positive
Set in the 1794 the second year of the French republic formed after the execution of Louis XVI this film portrays the power struggle between the revolutionary leaders Danton Gerard Depardieu at his finest and Robespierre a commanding performance by the Polish actor Wojciech Pszoniak The moderate revolutionary Danton has returned to Paris from his country seat where he has been since being deposed as leader of the Committee of Public Safety in the previous year by Robespierre He is opposed to The Reign Of Terror which has resulted in the executions of thousands of citizens mainly by guillotine who are thought to be opposed to the Revolution Danton is confident of the support of the ordinary people and tries to persuade Robespierre to curb the bloodletting But Robespierre and the Committee are afraid that the popularity of Danton will lead to them being overthrown and put Danton and his supporters on trial for being traitors This was the first French language film made by Andrzej Wajda after he had arrived in France from Poland His Polish film company was closed down by the government due to his support for the Solidarity trade union which had opposed the Polish government in the late seventies and early eighties His previous film Man Of Iron 1981 had dealt with the Solidarity union and its leader Lech Walesa and it is easy to draw comparisons between the relationship of Walesa and the Polish leader General Jaruselski and that between Danton and Robespierre DantonWalesa are the voice of reason opposed to RobespierreJaruselski who continue dictatorial rule despite having lost the support of the people they claim to represent The film is based on the Polish play The Danton Affair written by Stanislawa Przybyszewska in the 1930s and on its release the film was criticised by some for being static and theatrical But what the film does is to concentrate on the behindthescenes meetings of the Committees and the scenes in the National Assembly and the courtroom rather than the activities on the streets of Paris,positive
Both Robert Duvall and Glenn Close played their roles with such believability I simply cried Glenn Closes role as Ruth showed her wanting to deal with the situation but she was under the domination of her husband Let him think about what he did Robert Duvalls character Joe said staunchly The story depicted a rural family dealing with an accidental death of a son by his brother called The Stone Boy meaning he was so distraught and overwhelmed by what he did he became emotionally paralyzed Then towards the end when Jason Pressons character Arnold let it all out to a stranger I was so broken hearted for him that I actually thought of some of the terrible things that I did in my life I personalized and identified with his character Frederick Forrests and Gail Youngs roles did NOT add not much to the film I thought of Frederick Forrest who played Ruths antagonistic womanizing brother Andy as a jerk who did nothing to try to help the situation His wife Lou played by Gail Youngs acted like a crazylady smacking Arnold around out of frustration with her own problems without pity and blaming him for her troubles I could NOT really feel sorry for these two Though Lou tried to keep her marriage together she was unsuccessful Both did NOT deal with their problems effectively They really did NOTHING for the film and were totally ridiculous Wilfred Brimleys minor role as the grandfather was touching for he was the only character that showed Arnold any attention I felt his role should have been elaborated The players were just doing what they felt was adequate and sufficient However I really liked the ending so much I actually smiled and cried tears of joy I felt good The Hillermans were a family again I actually wanted to be a part of this family They were so realistic,positive

the only word that sums up this movie is quirky its a lighthearted romp through an existential concept bouncy in more way than one and a bit nutty i wouldnt exactly call it grand and unforgettable cinema and it doesnt seem quite as memorable as the directors first movie cube but its a good pit of fluff to watch on a Sunday morning the acting veers from respectable to annoying at times but i believe thats how it was to be written done as a serious movie it could perhaps have been great or may very well have stepped into a state of pretension a little like the matrix meets head meets human naturebr br 68 out of ten,positive
Just saw it yesterday in the Sao Paulo Intl Film Festival Just before going I came here to see how it was rated and at that time it was 74 a pretty nice ratebr br After 15 minutes I was dying to get out never did this but felt embarrassed to do so as the producer of the movie was in the screeningbr br I did not like at all the dialogs are shallow and lead nowhere the characters are shallower than the dialogs nothing lead anywhere and the worst and worst plenty of Siemens and Organics advertising on the movie Despite the fact that I already paid to go to the movie and entertain myself I still have to be bombarded by the main character chatting on the internet and Siemens mobile poppingup all the time on her laptop or another character having a bath or cutting her hair just to have Organics shampoo displayed enormously on the screen All of this would be bearable if the plot characters romances anything was good but was bad really bad A dont know how to do sexinthecitybr br Dont waste your time or money,negative
I found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie There was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story One did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work For example despite losing their transfer cable couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually they fortunately found a spare onboard the aircraft complete with Caribbeans According to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated I cant think why according to Daltry there battery operated drill would be unable to drill through the vault ceiling however they just happened to have a hydraulic drill complete with hoses and fittings to fit the equally convenient take off points in the planes hydraulic system located above the vault As the plane has a closed hydraulic system it is hard to see how this could be accomplished without affecting the control systems or at least setting hydraulic pressure alarms in the cockpit Accepting this for the sake of the plot it takes them several minutes to drill a small hole through the top of the vault tension will they be able to drill through before FEDs get there to check the false alarm yet from the time the vault door closed and before the FEDs had walked the few feet to the second security door they had cut a squire hole in the roof of the vault big enough for them to get through One can accept all theses and other inconsistencies for the sake of a good yarn however what spoiled the movie for me was when what appears to have been an effort by the script writers to discuses what up to that point was a fairly predictable ending they killed off the two heros If one can refer to crocks as heros Ketchum  Brooks one was shot and thrown out of a 747 at 10000 feet the other wiliest sliding down the cable between the two planes the villain Daltry with one hand manages to unhook the cable carrying the weight of a full grown man with the air pressure of several hundred miles per hour pressing on him and letting him fall to his death And yet in the next sequence these two without any kind of explanation however tenuous or implausible have miraculously survived the full from 10000 feet and had time to set up an elaborate scam to get the money The only comment on there survival was to Sophie that her brother is a bad shot Dont expect an Oscar nomination for this one,negative
An absolute classic of 80s scare flix This one isnt like any other as it pits pintsize wildeyed psychotic youngsters with an urge to kill against all the grownups in town Bud from JUST ONE OF THE GUYS 80s gold again plays one of the killerkids and hes paired up with one of the little girls Jake Blues tries to purchase in the BLUES BROTHERS There is a third blond boy but he keeps disappearing from the movie for whatever reason The violence is hilarious at times and also surprisingly gruesome in spots The demonic gang of smiling kids though somehow possessed by extraplanetary means bear little resemblance to the droidish Children of the Damned who never thought to use pistols crossbows and shovels to kill those pesky adults Julie Brown not Downtown Julie Brownthe other one shows her rack like three times as she dances around in her bedroom This movie is a rarity that I cannot believe I missed growing up in the 80s This would have been my absolute favorite movie as a kid if I had seen it Where is the sequel the ending begs for This movie is just incredible Seek it out at all costs,positive
I personally LOVE this film amidst the Halloween series Ive found after watching it with many friends that you enjoy it completely or find it absolutely unbearable Personally ive watched it dozens of times and it never gets old There is a great back story within the movie itself and a lot of different things are finally explained Its a rather short movie at just shy of 90minutes but its definitely a thrill ridebr br The shape seems to be pretty brutal in this film but the acting is still there with the way he walks stalks and kills There are a lot of neat little screen shots with Micheal appearing in the background which adds more of a spooky element to the movie,positive
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jane Austens works has been portrayed Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation but Im afraid I am biased to the AE version I have a hard time imagining Mr Darcy portrayed by anyone other than Colin Firthbr br The characters seemed shallow and often dialogue forced Lizzy seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book Her fancy for Wickham was overplayed and then her sudden like for Darcy was not believablebr br Darcy was portrayed tolerably well I will grant him He managed to maintain the aloofness that is required but I felt he did not project the feeling and inner struggle that makes his character so delightful especially in the proposal scenebr br Mr and Mrs Bennet were also played well but seemed lacking in many ways The mean temper of Mrs Bennet was not completely captured in her performancebr br Mr Collins was a good portrayal Very much in line with the bookbr br I will refrain from commenting on Lady Catherine except to say that she is possibly the worst portrayal in the entire filmbr br Other problems I saw were the few liberties they took with the order of events such as Darcy being present at the first meeting with Lady C and also that Miss Lucas and Sir William did not join Lizzy on her visit to the Collinsbr br The choreography was dreadful during the dancing scenes The scene where Lizzy and Darcy dance loses much of its intensity because one cannot get past the feeling that they look akward on the ballroom floor At least this BBC version left out the dialogue between Lizzy Darcy and Sir William when he commends the two on their dancing as they performed very ill indeedbr br There were occasional moments that it kept me interested but overall I find this version to be a disappointment I would not advise this film unless youre like me and you are excessively diverted by such folliesbr br ,negative
This film is about two female killers going on a tour to kill random men they meetbr br Wow Baisemoi just became the worst film of all time in my list The plot is crazy pointless and unnecessary The whole film is full of violence and sex and I am sure no sane parents would want to show this film to their children I dont understand what people get out of by making this film or watching this film Maybe someone somewhere has their perverted desires fulfilled There is simply no excuse or reasons for the existence of this perverted and depraved piece of workbr br The only consolation I offer myself is that I watched it on fast forward so that I have not wasted as much time,negative
A classy film pulled in 2 directions To its advantage it is directed by Wes Craven On the downside the TV film budget shows what could have been so much more with a larger budget It moves along as Susan Lucci draws Robert Urichfamily into her clutches and trying to persuade him into the secret of her health club His latest invention a spacesuit which can analyse people or things becomes unexpectedly useful in his new neighbourhood Anyone seeing this should pay attention to Susan Lucci Her looks and performance had an unexpected repercussions a few years later The actor scientist and parapsychologist Stephen Armourae is a fan of this film and wrote a review of this film Lucci became subject of a portrait by him followed as the basis for works of a sitter called Catherine Lucci and Barbara Steeles portrait in Black Sunday were used as references for the Catherine portraits which were immediately withdrawn by Armourae Probably due to a personal nature between the artist and Catherine So by seeing both films we can get an insight into another story and the appearance of unknown woman that would make an interesting film,positive
This is not exactly what I would call a Mad Max film after seeing Road Warrior and experiencing the excellence of that film I felt somewhat disappointed after seeing this It supposedly started out as some kind of kids in the wilderness film and was merged with the Mad Max franchisebad idea The casting was not exactly the best I mean come on Tina Turner One of the main problems with this film is that there are no good villains No Wez no Humungus not even a decent Toecutter Nothing really even happens if you are going to plan on seeing this sub par action flick can it even be called that make sure you see Mad Max 2 or Mad Max or better yet both Another problem with this film is that there are too many people even the Thunderdome battle sequence is dull Max doesnt even kill anyone The music is bad the characters are bad not in the good way and after seeing this film it left a very bad taste in my mouth,negative

This film was a big disappointmentbr br I take the opposite view of the critics This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors Bette Davis and James Cagney are simply not up to the level of the material Clark Gable and Claudette Colbert were every bit as big as Davis and Cagney and look how It Happened One Night turned out  an alltime classic With a very similar story Davis proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted Davis onenote performance oozes petulance but none of the nuances of Colberts acting in It Happened One Night Cagney who was a great comedy actor just seems outofsync with his costar Davis The script provides some decent lines and gags but the delivery seems better suited to drama than comedybr br Part of the problem is the soundtrack which like the delivery of Davis and Cagney seems more suitable to a light drama than a comedybr br Jack Carson who played similar roles throughout his career has more capably handled very similar material In a fairly typical supporting role Eugene Palette delivers a respectable performance In a slightly different role as an old west relic Harry Davenport is very good But in one of his poorest performances William Frawley is quite irritating His characters constant references to fictional cops are a poor effort at irony br br I really love every one of these performers and it is a shame that as an ensemble they achieve no more chemistry and no better result than The Bride Came COD,negative
Everything about this show is terrible Its premise even sets itself up to get cheap laughs with bad writing A disfunctional familytheme has already been used too many times most notably by the Simpsons which is an excellent show with great writing and many laughs Meanwhile Family Guy has about five minutes of story in each episode with tons of celebrity jokes and random flashbacks thrown in Now if this was original or funny sure Id think it was clever But no its not funny at all In fact the only reason the episodes are like this is because it is the easiest way to effortlessly crank out episode after episode of this junk Much of this show is unoriginal and what is original is just lame It is also amazingly crude and irreverent which again can be fine if its still intelligent Animation isnt everything either but from an artistic point of view this show fails also proving yet again that Family Guy strives for as many cheap jokes and easy shortcuts as possible People enjoy this show and I dont really care because people can enjoy anything they want no matter how much it aims for the lowest common denominator But no I dont recommend this especially for anyone who wants to someday study film or become a writer This is cheap entertainment that aims low and has found success in this The fact that this is so successful says bad things about America,negative

After his classic film noir homage Chinatown Roman Polanski returned to the themes that had given him his greatest hits in the 60s with this creepy psychological horror which like Repulsion and Rosemarys Baby deals with the paranoia and claustrophobia generated by apartment livingbr br Claustrophobic environments are the ones which Polanski is best at creating and this has to be the most suffocating and confined picture he ever created The emphasis on side walls and distant vanishing points is greater than ever and even in the small number of exterior scenes the sky is rarely glimpsed But The Tenant is not just confined spatially but also in the intensity with which it focuses on its protagonist Trelkovsky played by Polanski himself is not only in every scene he is in virtually every shot When he is not on screen more often than not the camera becomes Trelkovskys point of view And of course almost everywhere he looks he sees his own reflection staring back at him in a mirrorbr br I cant think of any film that is more about the internalisation and solitude of one character Some psychological thrillers like M or Peeping Tom manipulate us into feeling sorry for the mentally ill protagonist Others like Psycho attempt indepth scientific analysis of his mental condition The Tenant fits into neither of these categories  it simply immerses us completely inside Trelkovskys experience without demanding we actually understand or appreciate what is going on inside his head We feel his paranoia and obsession even though it is constantly revealed to us that they are irrationalbr br Polanski was also a master of the slowly unfolding horror film Often in his horrors there is an ambiguity as to whether there is actually anything sinister going on but they are among the most effective at frightening audiences Why Precisely because they unfold so slowly and invest so much time in painstakingly setting up situations that they immerse the viewer in paranoia A much later Polanski horror The Ninth Gate is a bit of a mess plotwise but at least it still manages to achieve that creeping sense of dreadbr br This is a rare chance to see Polanski himself in a major role His talent in front of the camera was as good as behind it and he is absolutely perfect as the meek Trelkovsky Another standout performance is that of the alltoooften overlooked Shelley Winters as the concierge In actual fact it is rather a stellar cast although many of the familiar faces look out of place in this strange Gothic European movie Also sadly many of the French actors in supporting roles are atrociously dubbed in the English language versionbr br The Tenant is more polished and less pretentious than Repulsion but it lacks the suspense and the character that make Rosemarys Baby so engrossing and entertaining The Tenant is good with no major flaws and Polanski was really on top form as a director but its not among his most gripping works,positive
From the creators of Bruce Almighty and Liar Liar The film took a while to pick up from the start at least for me seeing as I expected this was a runalong America Pie flick But it was slightly different a funloving slacker who finishes high school and makes his OWN college running it accordingly As you can expect theres a lot of parties and hot girls in bikinis but this film tried harder than your average teen flick Bartleby Gaines Justin Long encourages his students  peers to learn through freedom of expression and ultimately shove it to the system The humour was varied which I loved All the cast delivered fantastic performances hire this one out with a friend its a bloody crack up,positive
Tobe Hooper is quite possibly the biggest fluke the horror genre has to offer Like any other horror fan I loved the Texas Chainsaw but I think that in order to put your name in front on a movie title you should have at least more than one hit movie I cant really think of any other movie Hooper has done on his own dont count Poltergeist that has really made an impact on the horror genre or film world And this movie Night Terrors just backs up my pointbr br Poor Robert Englund I give him credit for at least doing a good job with the awful material he was given He did what he could As for the movie itself Pure drudge Unnecessary nude scenes every five minutes a story that must have been penned in an our and really just awful scenery music and cinematography Nothing in this film is redeemable Dont waste your timebr br Overall 1 out of 10 I feel sorry for Hooper his career seems like it was over before it really ever got started I hope that hes able to pump out at least one more good flick that way he can do his cult status some justicebr br ,negative

I am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 Whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is I surely could add various adjectives here but I think my point on this is clear 2 Whether to show how a twistedminded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 Whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 Or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a MOVIEbr br This was one of those movies that in a way  did not disappoint me From the first 10 minutes I kind of figured out that this movie will not be nominated for the best movie award and surprisingly enough  this was consistent throughout the whole time It was stupid enough to be worth the wait to see how stupidly it will continue and end  and I was not disappointed there either br br Was it a complete waist of time YES Which raises your question  WHY DID I WATCH IT THROUGHOUT Well I was trying to fall asleep and I thought this was a great candidate for that but unfortunately I had too much coffee before that,negative
The satirical movie website Dateline Hollywood joked that Son of the Mask was all a practical joke star Jamie Kennedy played on New Line Cinema for his show The Jamie Kennedy Experiment If only And if only the movie had been half as funny as that satire piecebr br The Mask was the ideal vehicle for the facepulling Jim Carrey that so many viewers dote on it also delighted males over the age of 12 by introducing Cameron Diaz So having a followup minus both of them was not a good idea plus youd have thought New Line would have learned their lesson after Dumb and Dumberer When Harry Met Lloyd But no though to be fair having an all new cast is in keeping with the original comic in which the Mask went from owner to owner As written by Lance Khazei and directed by Lawrence Guterman however theres nothing there in return except a steady stream of admittedly decent FX by the usual squadron of houses Industrial Light and Magic improving on the Ally McBeal dancing baby and their own Babys Day Out with the Tippett Studio Giant Killer Robots Digital Dimension and so on in support and an even greater pandering to cartoon fans by having our hero work at an animation company responsible for such gems as Siamese Popes naming his character after Tex Avery and working in not just references to classic cartoons but actual clipsbr br The trouble is that last approach doesnt really work partly because most of the attempts to bring cartoon trappings to live action fall flat especially the cars getting in the party mood and mostly because the tributes to the Flintstones Woody Woodpecker Duck Amuck and especially One Froggy Evening show up how weak this movie is in comparison Plus the movie fits in shambolic slapstick alongside strained sentiment the underlying theme of the story is family our hero isnt ready to have a son and his nemesis  Alan Cumming as the Norse god Loki  is far from the apple of Odins eye and what Bob Hoskins is doing here as Odin even after Super Mario Bros is beyond me and Kennedy just isnt in the same league as Carrey in the zany stakes  though its not like he gets any help from the script Also note that unlike Diaz the very cute Traylor Howard as the mother of the son of the Mask doesnt get much to do giving HER the Mask might have helped the moviebr br Further points are lost for throwing away Cumming Hoskins Steven Wright and Magda Szubanski for a suspiciously abbreviated running time which would account for some gaping plot holes and scenes that seem to be missing and for an incredibly bad attempt at an inside joke when our hero fails to sell the concept of the green guy as an animated TV series  The Mask did become an animated TV series in real life and was a far better follow up than this sequel The fact that this actually opened in Britain before the US should tell you everything what with this and Blade Trinity New Line seems intent on cornering the market on dreadful sequels with cast members from Two Guys And A Girl What next The Butterfly Effect 2 with Nathan Fillionbr br Somebody stop this,negative

This is a very amusing and sometimes quite creepy anthology that if a bit short in the screenwriting department more than makes up for the shortcoming in the acting location work and overall exuberance The best episodes of this are the first with Denholm Elliot playing a horror writer stalked by a character from his novel in the works  a perfect example of the acting pulling this out of the merely pedestrian the third with Christopher Lee as a man terrified of his own daughter and the final episode with the late great Jon Pertwee as a pompous horror film star who gets more than just a new role on his latest project The dialogue between Pertwee and Ingrid Pitt is sparkling and inspired both obviously relishing the opportunity to really ham it up Cushing is typically good in the weakest segment which certainly isnt helped by the fact that the wax figure of the woman hes obsessed with down at the local wax museum is anything but beautiful as we are told to believe she is Someone of shocking beauty was needed and instead were given a woman with a jaw of a turtle Minor quibbles aside this movie and its wonderful country house setting is one to catch when you can,positive

I must say out of all modern korean martial arts movies this one is worth checking out It wasnt as epic as MusaThe Warriors and didnt develop the characters as well but it had many nice ideas Simple story a elite soldier thought dead returns after years to end the reign of the Japanese in Korea in medieval days His counterpart was formerly the best friend he had and now he is out to stop him The fight scenes are all with sword or different weapons and very entertaining to watch The motives of the figures are discovered first near to the end You might need to watch it again to get all the connections right And me personallyI loved the end I could watch it over and over again Maybe a little pathetic but a real freedom fighter story People can be killed but not the ideas they stand for,positive

Not being a particular fan of westerns I watched this primarily because I wanted to see Lucille Ball in something other than an I Love Lucy or Lucy Show type of role Here she plays Christine Larson owner of a saloon in the Arizona Territory in 1868 whos about to be married to the unscrupulous local Indian agent Dean Jagger Balls performance was OK  nothing really more than that she didnt blow me away It succeeded for me in that the role was very different from what Im accustomed to seeing her in  there was very little of the outrageous physical comedy she later became famous for although the movie tried to maintain a gently amusing feel throughout A typical funny line  theres two ways to deal with women  and no one knows either one of them I didnt find the story all that compelling although I appreciated that the Indians were shown as the victims of the Indian agent Theres typical shootout action and a lot of horses  your typical western in other words As to Christine  we pretty much can guess from the beginning how her planned marriage is going to end up its just a question of how shes going to get there If you like westerns this would be a pretty typical one with a bit of humour thrown in If youre not big on the genre this will be lacking Im not big on the genre 310,negative
The story of Ed Gein is a disturbing and terrifying story Ed was truly a messed up character and his legacy went on to inspire such greats as The Tooth Fairy Norman Bates and Leatherface How is it then that such a fascinating man has inspired such a boring melodramatic piece of drivel Ed Gein made belts out of nipples bowls out of skulls lamps out of skin danced around under the moon in suits of human skin None of this made it into the movie because they needed to give us a fictitious story of a ridiculously awful deputy and his rather homely sexstarved girlfriend This movie seemed to go out of its way to falsify history What baffles me is that most movies stray from the path of truth to exaggerate history this one seems to do it to minimize it I just dont get it,negative

If youve not seen this then look out for it It is available on DVD It is a channel 4 uk production possibly in conjunction with German and danish TV If youve seen the film it is basically the same plot Several interleaved stories are connected through the drugs trade The story jumps between the housewife played by the excellent Lyndsay Duncan trying to complete a deal on behalf of her husband who to her surprise is an international drugs dealer and generally dangerous manbr br A minister who is embedded in his job to the detriment of his family is investigating the whole state of affairs with international drugs trafficking He gets a few eye openers to the reality of heroin when his daughter turns out to have a problem He then visit Pakistan officially where he seems to be taught that the abuse not simply the drug or its casual use is the problem and also gets to sample some produce an excellent scene where he simultaneously realises what the attraction is and why it is and why it is such a problem In Pakistan we get to see the other side The desperation of farmers who can barely survive turning to opium production and crime lords The pointless attempts at subsidy resulting in the system getting rich And a country so drenched in drugs yet only a relative fraction of the abuse we have in the west Around all this a customs officialinterpol agent tries to catch the dutch connection in heroin smuggling Seeking justice for his murdered partner This really is a masterpiece Super understated performances from all the main actors in a way only European cinema can really dobr br A must see Especially if you have seen the film they compliment each other abd present some subtly different opinionsattitudes from both sides of the pond,positive

If you cannot enjoy a chick flick stop right now If however you enjoy films that illustrate complex characters and provide extraordinary acting read onbr br Ann Grant Lord is dying Her two daughters arrive to be at her bedside Ann begins talking about people from her past of whom the daughters are unaware and they question as to whether these lost acquaintances are real or imagined They come to realize that these people from their mothers past are indeed realbr br The story shifts basically between 1953 and circa 2000 with a few glimpses at Anns life between those years It was in 1953 that Ann met the love of her life and experienced her lifes greatest tragedybr br One of Anns two best friends from college Lila is being married Anns other best friend is Lilas brother Buddy Lila and Buddy are the children of a rich Newport family whereas Ann is a cabaret singer living in Greenwich Village who wants to be a free spirit but is still bound by many of those 1950s conventionsbr br Soon after Ann arrives to be maid of honor at Lilas wedding she meets the person who will become the pivotal character in the lives of the three  Harris He is the adult son of a former servant of the family who grew up with Lila and Buddy and has gone on to become a physician in a small New England town Ann immediately becomes enamored of Harris which adds a complication to the fact that Lila has always been in love with Harris and continues to be Buddy also is in love with Harris but being 1953 he has redirected that homosexual desire for Harris to his good friend Ann for he cannot admit to himself that he has a sexual craving for another man Buddy exhibits his inner frustration outwardly by being the alcoholic wisecracking bad boy of the family  much to the chagrin of his very proper and uptight parentsbr br Needless to say all of these expressed and repressed emotions lead to tragedy  after all this is a chick flickbr br In the present time Anns daughters have become distant from their mother and are suffering their own life realizations and doubts Constance is working to emotional exhaustion trying to keep up her roll as perfect mother and wife Nina having always felt inferior cannot maintain a relationshipbr br Stir all of these relationships into a span of fifty years and you get an intriguing look at society its values and its effects upon the personalities and actions of the complex people involvedbr br All of the acting in Evening is excellent but there are some extraordinary performances and scenes  along with two unique family relationships  that make this film so very very specialbr br Claire Danes plays the 1950s Ann and she does it in a style that clearly shows an intelligent woman of those times who is conflicted by what she is supposed to do as opposed to what she wants to do Her performance is not easily forgettablebr br Vanessa Redgrave plays the dying Ann whose mind shifts from the present to the past to flights of fantasy and of course Redgrave pulls it all off with sterling stylebr br Natasha Richardson  Redgraves real daughter  plays Anns daughter Constance in the film The scenes between this real life mother and daughter playing fictional mother and daughter are an insightful treat to watchbr br Toni Collette plays Anns other daughter Nina Nina spends a good deal of her time being depressed and feeling sorry for herself while shutting out a good man who loves her as well as her mother and sister Collette is perfect for a part such as this but I have never seen her give a bad or unbelievable performance no matter what part she playsbr br Mamie Gummer plays 1950s Lila and shows us a woman even more conflicted of her expected role in life than her good friend Ann She is very goodbr br Meryl Streep  Gummers mother  plays present day Lila What is there to say about Meryl Streep other than she always gives an insightful and rewarding performancebr br Director Lajos Koltai states in the DVD extras that he sought out Glenn Close to play the relatively small part of Lilas mother because he felt she was the only actress he could think of to play one scene in the film He certainly was right and Closes performance in that one scene etches it in your mind All the other scenes in which Close is Lilas very proper mother and you get another performance to treasurebr br There are three other scenes in the film combined with the one featuring Close described above that make the whole movie worth watching On Lilas wedding day Ann comes into her room and crawls into to bed with her friend to discuss Lilas misforgivings about her upcoming wedding to a man she clearly does not love This scene is repeated fifty years later when Lila comes and crawls into bed with her dying friend Ann to talk about the lives they have lived In this latter scene Streep and Redgrave are enthrallingbr br The other memorable scene  at least to me  is when Buddy declares his love for Ann Hugh Dancy as Buddy gives us a heartbreaking performance of a young man torn apart by his conflicting sexual feelings His performance is superiorbr br Chick flick Yes A very special film with unbelievable acting directing and scenery Definitely I cannot recommend Evening too much,positive
Well what are the odds At the exact right moment that a few redneck amateurscientists discover cave paintings indicating that some type of dinosaur monster might have inhabited the area thousands of years ago a burning meteor crashes into the lake and spontaneously hatches a monsters egg that has been lying there  for over a thousand years I suppose The Crater Lake Monster is a movie that literally must be seen to be believed but you better do so in the company of many friends and a pile of ganja in order to make the wholesome a little bit easier to digest Yes this is a terrible film with the utmost ramshackle screenplay imaginable and numerous irrelevant padding interludes that are downright embarrassing but its also irresistibly charming and so clumsily put together that you simply have to cherish some kind of fondness for it Half of the film  at least  revolves on the wacky adventures of Arnie and Mitch These two local yokels own and run a boat renting shop near the lake but spend most of their days picking their noses and quarreling over fascinating stuff like to spell the word bait It is mostly during their prototypic Laurel  Hardy situations that new puddles of blood or decapitated heads are discovered in the lake Steve Hanson the heroic but not exactly sharp Sheriff is on the case but only if hes not too busy chasing big city thugs traveling through the area Halfway through the film there suddenly is an abrupt scene about a thug robbing a liquor store and killing two people in the process This textbook WTF moment appears to take on the complete other side of the country like in New York City or something and has absolutely nothing to do with the events going on at Crater Lake Only like twenty minutes later the robber pops up again in Hicksville and theres an exhilarating chase through the woods ending in the Dinos hungry muzzle The absurd little details in The Crater Lake Monster are too numerous to mention For example this is probably the only creaturefeature in which the players discover the obligatory gigantic footprint AFTER they already spotted the actual monster The goofs in continuity should be legendary as far as Im concerned Its like everybody forgot to pay attention to it Night turns into twilight into day and back into twilight  all during one and the same diurnal course The monster is undeniably the best aspect about the film especially since its accomplished through good old fashioned and adorable stop motion effects The cute critter is a Plesiosaur meaning an aquatic dinosaur looking like a crossbreed between Denver the Last Dinosaur and an alligator Crater Lake Monster is a unique and unforgettable movie experience that I can only encourage to track down The miserable 1 out of 10 rating is just out of principle and because basically this IS a very bad film should be put into perspective because I might as well could have given it 10 out of 10 for sheer entertainment value,negative
In 2004 I wrote the following statements on an IMDb message board when a user wondered if The Best Years of Our Lives was a forgotten movie br br  To me watching this movie is like opening up a time capsule I think in many ways The Best Years of Our Lives is probably one of the more fascinating character studies and it holds up extremely well as a look at life in the US in the mid1940s after WWII I believe Coming Home and The Deer Hunter both released in 1978 were the most recent films that were closest in capturing the numerous issues of military men returning from war that were brought up in The Best Years of Our Livesbr br What really impressed me was watching the movie in its entirety when I was in college around 198081 and many if not all of the college students applauded at the end of the moviebr br This movie still packs a wallop and Im very happy to read in other posts other users feeling of a movie that will definitely stand the test of time br br Im very happy to see the movie ranked near the top 100 movies on IMDb and AFI Also though it was in competition with what eventually became a Christmas classic Its a Wonderful Life arguably The Best Years of Our Lives Oscar wins including Best Picture were very welldeserved br br Ive just seen the film again in 2005 and after almost 60 years The Best Years of Our Lives is still a powerful beautifully acted and wellcrafted motion picture,positive

This is definitely a lesser known comedy short from the 1920s The only reason I saw it was because it was on a DVD by Kino Films featuring nonLaurel and Hardy shorts featuring Ollie They are interesting and historically important but also generally average to below average for the style film Compared to shorts by Chaplin Keaton Arbuckle and Lloyd they are definitely a step below them in quality and humor Also the accompanying music was pretty poor by the standards of other silent DVDs I ended up turning OFF the sound due to the inappropriateness of the music to set the proper mood But despite this they are still worth seeingbr br Ive gotta be honest about this short It was the last of 8 on this DVD and by the time I got to it I was pretty bored with the mediocrity of 7 of the 8 shorts So it is possible the film might be A LITTLE better than a 4but certainly if this is the case no better than a 5 The film is a pretty standard short about an incompetent bellboy Nothing especially interesting and there are certainly MUCH better silent shorts out there,negative

Who is Bettie Page I certainly didnt find out while watching this movie From what I have gathered from other sources Ms Page was highly in demand in the postworld war II period as the queen of naughty pictures and that is exactly what this film depicts I never did get to know Bettie the woman though Her childhood in Tennessee was a combination of an Evangelical Christian upbringing and a sordid home life which is only hinted at The film glosses over her personal life and gets right down to the purpose of the film the naughty pictures Characters are introduced and abandoned within a few frames but there is frame after frame of Bettie in her pointy bras Bettie in her girdle and stockings Bettie in bondageetc The movie slides from black and white to color every time Ms Page visits Miami Beach Then back to her shades of gray life in New York we go Gretchen Mol portrays Bettie as one of the most dimwitted young ladies you could ever meet When Bettie confides to a friend that she missed being her High School valedictorian by getting an A rather than an A one can only assume that there were only two students in her Senior class The most interesting part of this movie is how quaint Ms Pages naughty photos seem in 2007 It is truly sad that seeing a woman trussed up like a pig on a spit wouldnt even get a hit on My Space or You Tube Im not sure if this movie was written poorly or if some crazed editor cut the thing to shreds I would only recommend it as a source for persons studying the history of odd undergarments,negative

When I first saw this movie I had thought that it was going to be a terrible upset being directed by firsttime director Liev Schrieber What I saw in the next 130 minutes completely and utterly changed my mind Based on the novel by Jonathan Safran Foer Everything is Illuminated tells the story of a young JewishAmerican collectormasterfully played by Elijah Woodwho is trying to find the woman who saved his grandfather from the Nazis in WWII He travels to Germany and enlists in the help of a 20something club hitting translator and his grandfather This results in a rigid search across the country and they are determined to find what they are looking for Shot in some of the most beautiful countryside in the world Everything Is Illuminated delivers tension between the translator and his grandfather and of the help that Jonathan needs to find his quarry There is much religious matter as well as the grandfather refers to Jonathan as The Jew All in all This is a movie that deals with finding yourself and loving family I give this wonderful if not illuminated movie a 10 out of 10Arjun,positive

Youve gotta hand it to Steven Seagal whatever his other faults may be he does have good taste in women If you pick a Seagal movie chances are there will be one or more very beautiful women in it And usually they do not function as mere eye candy they get involved in the action and fight shoot guns kill with knives etc Flight of Fury offers the duo of Ciera Payton who has a very sexy face with luscious lips to match Angelina Jolies and Katie Jones and finds time to get them involved in both a catfight AND a little lesbian fondling And if it seems like Im spending a little too much time talking about them its because the rest of the movie although passable is so unexciting that its hard to find much else to talk about Ironically the weakest aspect is probably Seagal himself who looks as if he cant even be bothered to try to pretend to care This being a militarytype actioner there is very little fighting in it and he doesnt fit into his role a stealth fighter pilot the best in the world of course very well which may explain his almost offensive sleepwalking 12,negative

Got to be one of the best political satires I have seen to date with an excellent performance for Cusak Tomei and all the supporting actorsbr br Excellent plot very wellplaced and a very good unexpected twist at the end The action scenes were well filmed  choreographed Very funnybr br All in all I give this film a big thumbs up Its extremely critical of US military intervention in the middleeast and as such it may receive bad reviews from people who dont share the same political view or those who are simply too politically ignorant to appreciate the dark and drk humour Indeed at places the comedy was so close to the truth that it was borderline between funny and tragic,positive
Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Jason Robards out of Hungary into Austria However three things complement the story making this an extremely good moviebr br First the actors use the actual languages of their roles The Russian soldiers speak only Russian the Hungarians only Hungarian the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story Since Debra Kerr is English she speaks only English and of course Yul Brynner and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English As a result the empathy of the audience to the travelers becomes paramount The viewer shares all the confusion and suspense of being involved in an illicit border crossing when heshe cannot understand any of the languages spoken around them Very powerful feelings are aroused in the audience and notwithstanding the heavy use of foreign languages the audience is never at a loss for following the film No subtitles are necessarybr br Second I was in Hungary in 1995 and Im telling you this movie has it right on From the gypsy music overpowering the dinner meal to the underground caverns in the buildings where much of the action takes place to the village scenes the realism is incredible If I didnt eat in the actual restaurant in the movie I ate at its double I thought that I actually walked down the main street in that village Actually the film was shot in Austriabr br Third and most important this movie reunites Deberah Kerr and Yul Brynner after The King and I and the magnetism between them as the story unfolds is nothing short of Oscar qualified Of course Yul already received an Oscar for playing that relationship so the Acadamy wasnt going to give him another one but that is the quality of the film Dont miss this one,positive

RAINBOW BRITE AND THE STAR STEALER in my opinion is an excellent masterpiece I felt all warm and tingly when Rainbow Brite voice of Bettina and Krys voice of David Mendenhall set out to get revenge on the princess voice of Rhonad Aldrich If you ask me the princess was absolutely bitchy and diabolical To me she deserved to have Rainbow Brite and Krys seek revenge on him However I liked her castle as well as the rest of the setting In addition I thought that Lurky voiec of Pat Fraley and Murky voiec of Peter Cullen were diabolical Before I wrap this up Id like to say that everyone was perfectly cast the direction was flawless and Disney has scored a big hit In conclusion I highly recommend this excellent masterpiece to everyone who hasnt seen it especially diehard fans of the TV series I guarantee you youll enjoy it,positive
Deep Blood Its one of those movies you here about and you say not another Italian Jaws ripoff Well Deep Blood is far from that It is a cheap as film making can get and on the other side it is creative as well In Jaws and all the other shark films we all have seen or herd about they all use fake made sharks well in Joe DAmatos film he takes a new approach by using all stock footage for his shark scenes This is one of the many reasons I like Deep Blood so much is because it didnt use stock footagebr br In Deep Blood an ancient Indian spirit terrorizes a beach town in the form of a bloodthirsty shark in Joe DAmatos Shark classic Deep Bloodbr br It seems that a Native American elder once warned a group of youngsters about this great evil in the sea and years later the friends are forced to face their fears when one of them is killed by a shark in a series of attacks along their coastline Now its up to the remaining few to make sure that this monster is killed even if it means heading out to sea to do itbr br Joe DAmato Directed and Produced this film under his company the Filmirage Released in 1989 and was later used in Bruno Matteis Cruel Jaws Jaws 5 along with many other shark films Joe DAmatos shark entry is a great film and any Joe DAmato fan of shark movie watcher should give it a try,positive

A sentimental hearttugging family film set in England of the 1920s A young Elizabeth Taylor wins a horse in a raffle and decides to enter him in the Grand National fortunately exjockey Mickey Rooney is around to give Liz some help Director Clarence Brown displays some remarkable control with material that couldve been excessively maudlin in someone elses hands He and screenwriters Helen Deutsch and Theodore Reeves take great care in establishing genuine characterizations and developing the story naturally True there are one or two scenes that seem a bit forced but overall its quite affecting and gorgeously filmed in Technicolor The race itself is quite thrilling and like so many great classics theres a marvelous threehankie fadeout at the end Liz proves that she was a real trooper right from the start and Rooneywho I usually find rather annoyingis surprisingly subdued and really very good Donald Crisp is terrif as Lizs gruff father and Angela Lansbury is a delight as her older boycrazy sister Most of the acting kudos however belong to Anne Revere who won a richly deserved Supporting Actress Oscar playing Lizs wise and caring mother,positive
I had never heard of Robert Roy MacGregor before Rob Roy came out but the movie is definitely worth seeing Playing the title character Liam Neeson brings the same spirit to the role that he brought to Oskar Schindler and Jessica Lange also does a really good job as his wife Mary Archibald Cunningham Tim Roth is one person very likely to make your skin crawlbr br All in all this comes out as good as Braveheart maybe even better I laugh when I think of how Hollywood released two movies almost backtoback taking a swipe at England Very good Also starring John Hurt Eric Stoltz Brian Cox and Jason Flemyng,positive
because that is the only way you wont think this film is a TOTAL waste of time and money A remake of Heaven Can Wait which was at least worth watching is a poor excuse for a romantic comedy It is more a vehicle to give Rock some time on film for weak stand up comedy which doesnt play well on the big screen Especially because his jokes generally are supposed to be from the body of an old fat rich dead man but are shown coming from Rock himself As he insults Blacks and Whites the chemistry is all wrong The movie is not funny poorly shot the acting is weak at best Go rent Heaven Can Wait and a live Rock video and youll be way ahead of the game,negative

This effort is based on the true story of Jim Morris a high school science teacherbaseball coach who is inspired by his players to try out for the pros and fulfill his lifelong dream of playing in the majors Dennis Quaid no stranger to sports films plays Morris with enough conviction to make the part work and the producers do a credible job of recreating the realworld events that led to Morris brief stint as a relief pitcher for the woefull Tampa Bay Devil Rays The first half of the film dealing with his rag tag bunch of High School Baseball players all of whom look way too old to actualy be in High School is less effective and probably a bit too long Overall the film does suffer from some pacing issues and a few extra subplots that we probably could have done without However it is still a fairly involving movie with an inspirational theme that proves once again that baseball is the national pastime for a reason GRADE B,positive

This film was terrible OK my favourite film is The Wicker Man 1973 so I was always bound to be a little biased br br The plot rambles along throwing out enough of the key elements of the original to make the term remake highly dubious Hes not a virgin but IS allergic to bees WOW So many things happen that make no sense and are unexplained which Im afraid Mr LaBute does not a horror movie make How are two people we clearly saw blown up in a car at the start alive and well at the end of the film Cage looks haggard and bewildered throughout and his character is prone to calling out Rowan at the slightest noise The nods to the original are irritating as they come off as tacky rather than as intelligent homage For example certain incidents mirror the original The girl falling out of a cupboard pretending to be dead when WoodwardCage is searching the island and several lines of dialogue are plucked straight from Anthony Schaffers original screenplay and shoehorned inbr br Im sure others will provide a better and more detailed analysis than this I really cant be bothered to write any more about this film It lacks any kind of substance Throw it on the scrap heap with all the other remakes that have sullied the good names of the films they were based on in this case very loosely,negative
Kane is a killer named Jacob Goodnight he lives in this burned down old hotel where eight teen convicts go to do some cleaning Most of them die except for 3 of them In my case it wasnt the best writing or the best ever I still thought that the killing scenes were really well done Like when the one girl go eaten by the hungry dogs The best had to be when he shoved the cell phone down the Blonde Girls mouth Kane was a seriously great horror movie actor he had this serious look the entire movie and it would never change That was his only look the entire movie Great action and killing scenes I dont think I could give it a full 10 out of 10 but 6 seems good,positive

Director Douglas Sirk once said theres a very short distance between high art and trash and trash that contains craziness is by this very quality nearer to art This statement defines his cinema perfectly a very unique body of work that includes classic stage adaptations adventure and war films westerns and of course his famous melodramasbr br Sirks melodramas were as the very word signifies dramas with music The music sets the tone for his masterful style and every stroke of his brush Sirk was also a painter leaves a powerful image on the screenturnedcanvas But this aint life but its representation an imitation of life Sirk never tried to show reality on the contrary None of the directors of his generation made a better use of all the technical devices provided by Hollywood most notably Technicolor to distinguish the artificial from the real thing Lets remember that his golden period coincides with the time when Hollywood films turned its attention into the social drama Blackboard jungle Rebel without a cause Sirk always knew that cinema was meant to be something elsebr br Another of Sirks statements summarizes this You cant reach or touch the real You just see reflections If you try to grasp happiness itself your fingers only meet glass I defy anybody that has seen Written on the wind to count the amount of mirrors and images reflected that appear on screen One ends up giving upbr br Therefore we are in a hall full of mirrors where theres no difference between real and its false copy Nobody can say that the Hadley are real people That town aint real either with those hideous oil pumps all over the place So in this realm the acting is affected the decore is fake the trick is visible Everything is pushed a little bit off the limit the sexual connotations of Dorothy Malone with the oil tower for example Sirk was criticizing and theorizing at the same timebr br The angles are the directors thoughts the lighting is his philosophy In Written on the wind we follow the fall of a traditional way of life both in a geometrical way and in terms of light and shadows The Hadleys house with its different levels connected by the spiral staircase operates in a strictly metaphorical way A house that resembles a mausoleum that no party can cheer up As tragedy progresses from luminous daylight to shadowy night Sirks photography becomes an extension of the inner state of his characters and so are the colours of the clothes they wear Drama is thus incorporated to every element at the service of the directors craftbr br Sirk considered himself a story bender because he bended the standard material he was assigned with to his style and purpose Written on the wind is a good example It wouldnt work in any other handsbr br The other director that was using similar strategies was Frank Tashlin who was for 50s comedy the same that Sirk was for melodrama Their films are full of the machinery of american life advertising TV sets jukeboxes washing machines sport cars vacuum cleaners to depict its emptiness and decay Im inclined to think that their films were regarded in a different way by their contemporary audiences The game was played by both sides so it was camp Now we regard them as cult or bizarre because we are not those spectators anymore That is why Todd Hayness homage Far from heaven turns into a pastiche because it reproduces Sirks work nowadays as if nothing happened in between Then Sirk turns exactly into that painting hanging in the art gallery that Julianne Moore and the gardener discuss in the aforementioned filmbr br Sirk understood the elements of melodrama perfectly There were always immovable characters Rock Hudson and Lauren Bacall here against which he could assemble a series of split ones His balance through antithesis is remarkable and not surprisingly we root for the split characters because these are the ones Sirk is interested in too When Robert Stack flies the plane and tempts Lauren Bacall with all sorts of mundane comforts of the world below them obvious Faustian echoes we are strangely fascinated with him too as we are when the devilish nymphomaniac little sister painfully evokes her past with Mitch alone by the riverbr br In the Sirks universe the studio oftenimposed happy ends have no negative impact In fact they worked just great Sirk was fond of greek tragedy and considered happy endings the Deux ex machinea of his day Thus the final courtroom scene fits well and one must also remember that the whole film is told in flashback so we know from the very beginning that tragedy will fall nevertheless over the Hadley feudbr br It was pointed out the many similarities between Written on the Wind with the Godfather saga I absolutely agree and Im sure the parallel is not incidental Both share the theme of the old powerful father head trying to keep his empire going while protecting his family The temperamental son portrayed by Robert Stack has an amazing physical resemblance with Jimmy Caans Sonny Corleone The action of fighting her sisters male friend is symmetrical The nonson in which the old man put his trust is also common in both films as the fact that both families carry the names of their town Even details as the gate that gives access to the property and the surroundings of the house covered by leaves suggest that Coppola had Written on the Wind in mind while setting his masterwork Because both films deal with the subject of Power the acquisition of power its manipulation and legacy even Kyle Hadleys sterility the event that hastens the turmoil is an issue easily tied to the central theme of Power in this case a weakness in sexual power The other great film that deals with power and uses american life as its representation is Citizen Kane One wouldnt think at first of similarities between Welles and Sirks films but there are a good many starting with the petrol business as the origin of the familys fortune and ending in the fact that Mitch Wayne Rock Hudson as Charles Foster Kane was adopted by a tutor having his own father alive Amazingly the same actor Harry Shannon perform both Wayne and Kanes fathers This detail is cannot be a coincidencebr br Written on the Wind is a masterpiece in every aspect in execution and vision in style and technique a highlight in the career of this wonderful director Some say that this is his best film In my opinion Magnificent obsession All that heaven allows Theres always tomorrow and Imitation of life are just as good And for those who put Sirk in the level of Dallas or Dinasty I wish them no happy end,positive
I seriously dont know why this movie got such a hostile reception when it was first released Sure its overlong and somewhat gratuitous in its depictions of sexuality and violence but so are lots of well regarded movies I seriously dont think that the people who hated Heavens Gate really understood it Heavens Gate in its uncut form much like The Deer Hunter shows the gross differences of living an insecure and dangerous life like the immigrants and Averil in Wyoming and living in comfort and privilege like the settled Americans in Wyoming and Averil in the prologue and epilogue Living a hard life is painful but it can also be invigorating as opposed to the dull life Averil leads in the epilogue Also as Michael Cimino took great pains to make the picture historically accurate  it is fascinating as a document of and maybe indictment of American life in Old West Wyoming The dialogue is often genuinely clever and emotional Combined with great music and cinematography the movie works like a truly poetic work of art Granted Heavens Gate with its refusal to patronize the viewer is not for all tastes However Hollywood turns out so much commercial dreck each year which is so much easier to dismiss as mindless eye candy even when an example of it becomes a blockbuster that Gate and Cimino really do deserve more respect All people should see the uncut version at least once and then they should make up their own mindbr br ,positive
Thursday is a good movie but we recognize too much from other movies in its genre and therefor it lacks originality If you have seen Goodfellas Reservoir Dogs Pulp Fiction and a bunch of other movies that were inspired by that last one you have seen almost every part from Thursday There is a scene that involves torturing that has even the same dialogue as in Tarantinos Reservoir Dogsbr br Still it is a good movie Because not every part is taken from the same movie the complete thing has some new ideas and some nice touches The opening sequence to begin with is quite impressive We meet Nick Aaron Eckhart Dallas Paulina Porizkova and Billy Hill James Le Gros They get into a fight with a clerk in a gas station over a cup of coffee and it ends with the death of that clerk and the arrival of a cop Weve already glimpsed at a suitcase with a lot of money in itbr br Then we meet Casey Thomas Jane in Houston He is married to Christine Paula Marshall but used to be working with Nick She doesnt know a thing Then Nick gives him a call and says that he is coming We learn that he has screwed his friends over and the problems are about to startbr br What happens exactly is not for me to reveal but we meet some other characters all interested in the money or the drugs Nick also had with him Casey has flushed those down the drainbr br Very funny moments a lot of blood a very funny subplot involving actor Michael Jeter and some surprises although if you really think about it you see them coming this is a good movie with some very fine performances nicely directed by Skip Woods,positive
I wish Depardieu had been able to finish his book and see it become a dazzling success At least hed have wound up with somethingbr br The film struck me as pointless rambling and very stylish like some other recent French films Not to knock it Most recent American films are pointless and rambling and have no style whatever We should be grateful I suppose for photography that evokes a European city in the midst of a windblown Continental winter and for elliptical conversations that challenge our ability to understand whats upbr br But there can be too much of a good thing Golubeva is found stumbling around near the sea in the middle of the freezing night carrying on in a bad accent about dreams and such There are a few sequences of dreams that include things like swimming in a river of blood Youll love it if youre Vlad the Impaler Lots of people die Catherine Deneuve dies in a suicide by motorcycle I dont know why Golubevas young girl dies too and I dont know why she dies either She gets slapped in the face falls to the pavement and diesbr br There is supposedly an explicit sex scene too Ill have to take their word for it because although it is stylishly photographed it is stylishly photographed in almost complete darkness Dont worry about the kiddies being shocked Theyll probably be asleep by this time anywaybr br Depardieu isnt a bad actor As we see him deteriorate from a carefully groomed handsome young man  well handsome except that his nose cant seem to get out of his way  to a limping murderous hairy physical wreck we feel sorry for the guy Golubeva has a wan pretty face with enormous halflidded eyes and wide cheeks like a doll Her next movie should be a remake of Lewtons I Walked With a Zombie Then there is this mysterious guy who leads a band I guess its a band As far as I could make out the band is made up of about a dozen drummers and a dozen musicians playing electric guitars Every viewer will find the resultant sound interesting but uncultivated listeners fond of easy listening might not enjoy it If you dont like the music theres a payoff involved because the sinister composer and leader gets whacked over the head with Depardieus walking stickbr br I must say I found it barely worth sitting through And its a longie too At times it was like waiting in your car at a railroad crossing while a long long freight train rumbles slowly by sometimes stopping entirely I wish it had had a few jokes,negative

Others have harped here about James Stewarts age when playing Lindburg he was 47 Linburg was twenty five But Stewart does not look his age and the film for him was a dream come true An actual pilot and a retired Air Force Reserve General at the end of his life Stewart had the feel for the character and understanding of his passion which other actors could not bring to the role Added to the cast was costar Murray Hamilton who was also to be featured in The FBI story with Stewart and such other well known character actors as Richard Deacon of the later Dick Van Dike Show and Robert Cornthwaite of The Thing from Another World the 1951 SciFi classicbr br Billy Wilder captures the flavor of the Lindburg Autobiography and the telling of what was to become a major event in the history of aviation This story and film are a testament to the soul of determination and perseverance to realize a dream A box office failure at the time of its release it has since become one of the great classics of American Film and another in a long line of outstanding performances by an actor that has been called Americas Everyman No student of film history should miss seeing this one There have been over 500000 films since the beginning of motion pictures and this one belongs among the top 500,positive
Painful Painful is the only word to describe this awful rendition of such a fun and interesting Shakespearean play I gave it a shot but was terribly disappointed and couldnt bare to even finish viewing it To the person who wrote a novel about how wonderful this twist of Much Ado was I pity you and your bored brain May your pretenses about young viewers be lifted without retribution Please do not even bother with this gut wrenching disgusting excuse for a performance of an acclaimed Shakespeare drama You will be forced to induce vomiting and will require a commode close to the television with which you choose to watch this crap because involuntary defecation will take place,negative
As a longtime admirer of the 2001 film Moulin Rouge and a more recent admirer of Jean Renoirs filmmaking I knew that Id inevitably watch his French Cancan sooner or later The movie tells a fictionalized story of the opening of the Moulin Rouge nightclub The impresario Danglard Jean Gabin tries to turn Montmartre laundress Nini Françoise Arnoul into a cancan star without arousing the wrath of his tempestuous mistress the bellydancing Lola Maria Felix This is just one of several love triangles in French Cancantrue to stereotype these French showbiz folk are always falling in lovebr br Renoir directs with his typical gentle humor and attention to supporting characters and also wrote the lyrics to a beautiful waltz song prominently featured in the movie Gabin perfectly incarnates the aging French playboy hero Arnoul is a cute redhead who holds her own in the dance numbers except for a few trick shots where a double is obviously usedbr br French Cancan is billed as a musical comedy and while there are lots of musical numbers that take place on the nightclub stage etc only one character Casimir ever breaks into song in the middle of conversation The actor who plays him Philippe Clay is fun to watcha really tall skinny young man who sings dances and does contortionsbr br The movie ends with a long cancan sequence as all the characters learn to triumph over their problems and make art together The dancing is much more brightly lit and coherently edited than in Moulin Rouge in fact if I have one complaint about French Cancan its that the whole thing is a little too Technicolor Even when Nini experiences heartbreak or someone sings a melancholy song the lighting is bright and flat no shadows intruding Yes the result is a cheerful and warmhearted musical comedy its just that I cant help thinking that things werent ever this colorful and innocent in real life,positive
I just saw this movie mainly because Brady Corbet is in it and I must say that I was not pleased br br Of course the computer graphics were amazing but the story line needed a little touchup Also I think this movie would have done much better with more curses and blood as well if it were rated PG13 br br That would definitely attract more people to see itteens What would also attract more teens particularly teen girls would be a large close up of Brady Corbet on the Thunderbirds poster br br Even though the movie had its down points I still saw it and thought it was okay,negative

Jason Bourne sits in a dusty room in with blood on his hands trying to make sense of what hes just done Meanwhile a CIA chief in NYC outlines the agencys response to whats just happened on screen An American flag stands proudly on the centre of his desk in the foreground of the shot but as he speaks it slips out of focus as his plan veers into morally dubious territory as if it doesnt want to be associated with the course of action the government man decides is necessary in the interests of national securitybr br This shot effectively captures the mood of the film As well as portraying Bournes quest to find out how he became Jason Bourne Ultimatum is also an examination of the human costs of the measures taken to protect us in the interests of stability and securitybr br It is also probably the best film youll see in the cinema this year br br Its just so intense Bourne says to Simon Ross Considine This isnt some newspaper story this is real and in the audience you almost believe him The camera shakes but remains steady enough for you to see everything and feel like youre there with Bourne as he tries to elude his pursuers and the performances are so good that these guys seem as though they are the characters theyre portraying instead of just being actors performing wellwritten roles The action scenes are so brutally fastpaced and well choreographed that they seem instinctive instead of planned to the minutest movement the stuntwork is nothing short of amazingbr br The pacing is just incredible It keeps driving forward towards its conclusion but not so fast that it leaves you struggling to piece together the plot the script delivers the information you need as quickly and clearly as possible before moving on to the next tense action setpiece While theyre often simple the Waterloo sequence is essentially just a man on a phone being watched by a man on a phone theyre charged with such dramatic intensity that you cant take your eyes off them The film is just so focused on powering forwards that you cant help being swept along by itbr br With its intense action setpieces brilliantly paced storyline and intelligent examination of the decisions made in the name of national security the Bourne series is one that accurately captures the ambiguities of our age Ultimatum is its peak,positive
The movie Angels of the Universe is a pure masterpiece and it proves once again that you can make a brilliant movie on a low budget eg American Beauty and Blair Witch Project The Director Fridrik Thór Fridriksson gives the novel Englar alheimsins a new life on the white screen The movie is a breakthrough in Icelandic film making because its the biggest and the greatest movie that has been done in Icelandbr br The music in the film played by Sigurrós is very symbolic for the film it is absolutely brilliant I recommend everybody who are able to think to go and see this film as soon as possible you wont be disappointed I would bet on this film to win the best foreign film award next year  all over the globe,positive
with what they had John and Carolyn were very private so the writers had to put together what they could I really liked Portia de Rossi as Carolyn but Jacqueline Bissets voice grated on my nerves She should have used her regular voice I would have preferred that the whole movie focus on John and Carolyn instead of rehashing stuff we already know about John,positive
While I score the movie a 7 I also should point out that it is both interesting historically as it stars Mae Marsh Lillian Gish and Lionel Barrymore when they were all younger and less wellknown and features pretty exciting action for its daybr br The plot is odd for a Western in that all the trouble with the Indians begins for the weirdest reason I have ever seen The Indians decide to have a giant dog banquet no they are not feeding dogs but feeding ON dogs and when two Indians arrive late there are not pooches left So they steal two dogs belonging to two orphans from the nearby White settlement and this actually touches off an allout war Not only is this silly but seems to play on the prejudices of audiences I dont know if American Indians actually ate dog but it sounds like the sort of stereotype that later was applied to other ethnic groups All this over dogs The movie has some excellent battle scenes and exciting momentssuch as when Ms Marsh crawls across the battlefield to save a baby Exciting stuff But STRANGE too,positive
With the current trend of gross out humor this film is the granddaddy of them all While some of the humor is dated every skit will either shock repulse or make you laugh out loud Most memorable is the sex games commentary and of course the VD commercial It doesnt always work but pays off when it does I give this a 7,positive

This has to be one of the all time greatest horror movies Charles Band made the best movie of 96 in this little seen gem Highly realistic and  incredibly stylised with a visual flair David Fincher would envy its not hard to see why Band went on to make such classics as Killjoy 2 Deliverance From Evil The Regina Pierce Affair Virgins of Sherwood Forest and Timegate Tales of the Saddle Trampsbr br With a highly sophisticated story a tiny body with a large head controls a family of weirdos who perform experiments on naked women this movie may be a bit too much for younger viewers and is only for the most educated type of viewer but for those who see it Band is able to convey subtle messages about the human condition through his masterpiece The head is symbolic of the lost love and longing for ones inner self that we all must face at one point or another and for this reason i was able to engage with this film on a deeply personal level Although many earlier critics have compared Bands film to Reanimator and other lesser works this stands head and heels above the rest It is gorier but not pointlessly The gore in this film is well crafted and used to enhance the storyline rather than to just get a cheap shriek out of the audience Also the special effects in this film are absolutely top notch easily the best work done in a horror film since well ever The work in this film makes Savinis effects look like the work of a blind limbless hobobr br The only problem i have with this film is the copious amounts of full frontal nudity which were ultimately unnecessary in achieving the composers goal to create a timeless epic that would forever go down in history as possibly the greatest film of all time If it were not for this slight problem i would have given this film a perfect 10,negative
I like underground films when they have something to say or show for that matter I tried hard to like Trash I tried to see some artistic achievement or some interesting representation of New York City life in the early 70s Or at least being entertained by it But the movie stinks and cant be called either art or entertainmentbr br Trash is basically an excuse to expose Joe Dallesandros nude body for 2 hours while he meets other uninteresting annoying figures I agree thats a gorgeous body but no excuse for a whole movie about it right Holly Woodlawn as Joes girlfriend provides a few good laughs by the end but then its too late to save those wasted couple of hours Lou Reeds classic song Walk on the Wild Side is a better portrayal of those people and that time even if its more fascinating than they actually were 1510,negative
I read Schneebaums book same title as this film when it was first published and was deeply moved by his ability to see through the many ways of otherness his own and the people of the Amazon with whom he lived and loved to a way of living a decent life His subsequent books were not as powerful but showed his continuing quest His description of his sexual relations with the men of the tribe was way ahead of its time in the early 60s but his honesty and openness about it were welcome This movie beautifully conveys both the quirkiness and generosity of the man but also provides a glimpse into the inevitable destruction of innocence which is not a morally positive term in this case that occurs when civilized men intrude on traditional societies Even so Schneebaum himself has moved into a kind of higher innocence that suggests the possibility of saving humanity from its own destructiveness,positive
Why all the negative reviews You didnt expect a movie like this to be a masterpiece did you What we have is a movie that tried to entertain us and it worked for me Not an oscar contender just entertainment You can really see how the movie has aged especially with everything the internet has to offer nowadays I still remember when this was first released and the net was still so new Crazy and scary thoughts when I saw this for the first time I was 15 and seriously thought anyone could get a hold of your information on a computer and destroy you But whos to say it cant happen Im not the type of person to nitpick a movie to death analyzing it until Im blue in the face Thats not my style Average acting suspensful and once again very entertaining Sandra Bullock as Angela Bennett is so cute This is my favorite movie with her in it because shes like the computer genius which I find very attractive Of all the movies that were released in 1995 this would have to be my favorite although I didnt see it until 1996 My rating 910 because it did slow down a little,positive
OK this movie had a terrible premise Be serious according to the movie they had just been through an apocalyptic war yet they have money to buy huge robots and pit them against each other Each country decides instead of investing into rebuilding their country they would rather fight with robots no one could afford Heres a better idea lets rely on our most inept resourcejocks to fight our battles br br Everyone says what about the director what about him He makes a good movie he makes a bad movie There is no reason to give this movie some credit just because of the director maybe he was asleep I thoroughly enjoyed this movie because it was so cheesy and ridiculous I had to laugh I actually had a good time watching it well except for the cowboy mentor who turns out to be an assassintrust me no one would see this guy as an assassin so it is a surprise however lame What kind of training exercise is a jungle jim anyway I was sad to see Mst3k had not done this one I am giving a two star rating however because nothing could be as bad as manos the hands of fatebr br The budget does not matter either I have seen plenty of reasonable movies that had nothing for budgets like cube The storyline was not even plausible and I have seen better acting in school plays Surly they could have afforded an eleven year old from any middle school playbr br Anyway pick it up it is a fun movie to watch,negative
It is high time that American critics and fans alike start to debunk their unquestioned sloppy veneration of films like Sergio Leones Once Upon a Time in America The checkered history of this opulent film and the grand fanciful myth associated with its production and many versions belies its mediocrity on a narrative level The film lurches backward and forward in fits and starts its central figures adrift and seemingly out of place surrounded by the ersatz decadence of towering sets the minutia of production detail and the by 1984 cliched but gorgeous cinematographic confection on offer to the audience The plots time frame is confusing gimmicky and laboured leading some critics to imagine the Noodles figures opium binging to be the antecedent of some future dream reality as well as the sepiatoned remembrances This ham handed overly fan boyapologetic interpretation glosses over the glaring narrative irregularities on display Even at this full  running time figures appear and disappear with alarming suddenness the Deborah character is fleetingly established in child form a cold and unattainable trophy female not even hinting at the gravity with which she will reestablish her relationship with a postprison Noodles the said reunion henceforth rings completely false The deadening pace is somewhat to blame certain sequences drag along stagnantly for far too long signifying very little hinting at a director with so little restraint and narrative economy that he often feels obligated to usurp every iota of screen time possible in order to show off his production fatal for a film that contains figures so sullen and aloof The trajectory of the figures lives is presented to us as a microcosm mirroring the historical trajectory of Americas teens through prohibition and its spoils ending with the arguable ruin of its moribund central figures save Deborah a make up department fumble or intentional one wonders This notion is commonplace even banal The cast of characters as imagined in the one note script written by seven Italians no less are flatly and awkwardly played by all but the younger actors who at least venture a few variant facial expressions This is understandable given the almost unworkable material Some critics state that the characters may seem so impenetrably selfabsorbed but actively seek their own goals assuming the compliance of others eg when Noodles gets out of prison Max picks him up and offers him a hooker without asking him whether or not this is what he desires and later makes deals assuming Noodles will comply This explanation of their abrupt abrasive dispositions is unsatisfactorily extraneous and merely serves to highlight the complicated ends the films unwavering supporters will go to to defend their positions regarding a film unfortunately short on sense Although Ennio Morricones score is much revered it is undeniably schmaltzy and repetitive it gushes with an emotional redolence that the scenes themselves many violent just do not warrant At points it is questionable whether or not Morricone was watching the same film I was so incongruous is his work As a paean to American Filmmaking it succeeds in terms of mood helped by a few strokes of masterful editing segueing between time periods and visuals not helped by said score but lacks narrative cohesion and fluidity,negative
A journey of discovery this film follows the lives of one family living in a sleepy island town in British Columbia Languorous and dreamy the inhabitants are satisfied to allow life to go on around them until a young freshfaced teacher with new ideas arrives and brings with her life from the mainland Slowly their indolent state is awakened the father and principal of the local school looks for excitement the mother for stability the oldest daughter for love and the youngest for power While not an incredible or groundbreaking piece of cinema the movie is quietly enjoyable and good for a tired night when the wind is blowing Unfortunately I doubt anyone outside of Canada will find it easily accessible,positive

It does not surprise me that this short 91 minutes BW movie that was made 50 years ago in the Soviet Union during the short period called ottepel or the thaw has gained so much love and admiration among the movie lovers over the world It is sublime and beautifully filmed Some scenes feel like there were made way ahead of their time Sergei Urusevskys camera work and creative discoveries were included in the text books and widely imitated The film tells the moving and timeless story of love destroyed by merciless war but eternally alive in the memory of a young woman It is also the film about loyalty memories ability to live on when it seems there is nothing to live for it is about forgiveness and about hope The film received absolutely deservingly the Grand Prix at Cannes Film Festival and Tatiana Samoilova was chosen as a recipient of a special award at Cannes for playing Veronika the young girl happily in love with the best man in the world in the beginning of the movie After separation with her beloved who went to the front the loss of her family in the bomb ride and the marriage to the man she never loved and only wished he never existed she turned to the shadow of herself she became dead inside Her long journey to redemption to finally accepting death of her beloved and to learning how to live with it is a fascinating and heartbreaking one and it simply wont leave any viewer indifferentbr br For me the movie is very personal and dear because I was born and grew up in the city where its characters lived and were so happy in the beginning I walked the same streets squares and bridges over the Moskva River Every family in the former Soviet Union had lost at least one but often more than one family member to a combat or to the concentration camp or to the ghetto or to hunger cold and illnesses during WWII and my family is not exception My mother and grandmother knew the horrors of war and never healing pain of losses not just from the movies and the books Cranes are Flying speaks to me clearly and honestly and touches me very deeply It is a masterpiece of movie making but it is a part of my life  my background my memory and my past,positive
Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation Richard Linklaters romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people The film depicts romance in all its glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship thats as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to  with just one problem the problem of time While most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental Hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders The story follows two people Jesse an American and Celine a French girl that meet on a train into Vienna They instantly connect and after telling her his awful idea for a television show and almost getting off the train Jesse asks Celine to join him for the day in the picturesque city of Viennabr br Before Sunrise works principally for two reasons  realistic acting and an immense script that builds the characters through their thoughts and feelings and thus allows us to get to know them as we do the people in real life This allows the characters to be free and its easy to believe that these are real people and not just actors working from a script This also allows us to feel for the characters for who they are and not merely because theyre the protagonists This kind of realism is hard to capture as at the end of the day we as the audience know that theyre watching a film and not observing real life but Before Sunrise represents one of the truest to life exhibitions of realism ever to be seen on screen A truly great script cannot work on its own and needs great actors to deliver it to an extent that does it justice and although Im not a fan of either Julie Deply or Ethan Hawke on viewing this film there is nothing you can do but give them both respect I dont know whether they were in character or just playing themselves but when a film is this good it hardly mattersbr br In a film like this it is the writing thats the most important thing and contained within the script are several observations about life most of which I personally could relate to This represents what Richard Linklater has achieved with this script as not only does it create and build the characters but it also manages to expose what true love is along with several other aspects of life The fact that not all the anecdotes are relatable to me personally again represents the brilliance of writing Everyone is different and so different parts of the script will appeal to different people There could be certain aspects about one person that one person loves and another hates and thats the case with the musings in this script Adding to the beauty of the film is the city of Vienna The city itself isnt really important to the film as this is a story that could have taken place just about anywhere  but it makes for some lovely visuals and the upbeat energetic romance that blossoms throughout the movie is matched by the beauty of the locationbr br Before Sunrise is simultaneously beautiful and captivating Richard Linklater has created something that is rare in the world of cinema a film that captures the beauty of life without ever going over the top or being overly sentimental Before Sunrise is what it is And what it is is pure cinematic brilliance,positive

Mishima is one of the greatest films ever made Now I think Paul Schrader is the greatest screenwriter of all time but I dont really like the films hes directed of what Ive seen with the exception of this and Affliction but this is an amazing disturbing and highly 3dimensional character study It follows the life of Yukio Mishima Japans most celebrated writer combining the last day of his life with flashbacks and his stories I dont know how but Paul Schrader manages to combine all of those in a very artistic way The acting is great so is the photography and a perfect score by Philip Glass Although confusing the first viewing this is one of the few films that becomes richer with each viewing Truly an underrated gem of a film,positive
The English Patient can rightly be compared to the films of David Lean whose sweeping epics such as Lawrence of Arabia and Bridge on the River Kwai must have inspired the director Anthony Minghella The film is beautifully photographed and like Lawrence is set in Northern Africa but during the second world war The story is complex but it boils down to a forbidden love between an opinionated and often difficult archeologist played by Ralph Fiennes and a married woman played by Kristin Scott Thomasbr br  The story based on a novel by Michael Ondaatje is told in flashbacks by Fiennes Count Laszlo de Almasy  the titular character The fact that his name does not sound like hes English plays a key role in what unfolds He has been badly burned in a plane crash occurring just as the film opens and is being cared for back in Europe by Hana an army nurse played by Juliette Binoche What makes this story epic is the vast sweep across place and time and the development of characters beyond that of the two illfated lovers The film makes clear that true love and passion even with dreaded consequences can make life worth living or worth dying for If youre a romantic at heart and can appreciate a film without the standard happy endings and simple moral codes you may find that The English Patient speaks directly to youbr br ,positive

I actually liked certain things about this game I loved the first person perspective and wish we had had that choice in the first three games Theres nothing like seeing the monsters up close in your face The graphics really werent bad but I would have liked more things to interact with even though it was just a shooter The music was fine The things I hated were The movement kind of sucked and aiming was a total pain The story was too lame for words and too much of the same old thing with no originality The inability to save was awful Some of us do have a life and would like to save to finish the game later I thought the weapons kind of sucked too This game is fun for awhile but its nothing like the first three and only good if you just want to shoot stuff Id recommend it for the novelty of playing in the first person but thats about it Play it at your own risk,negative
This movie is one of the worse movies of all time Im kind of upset this movie isnt on the bottom 100 it deserves a spot at least number 60 or 70 on that list This isnt just a film I think is bad in a campyfun sort of MST3K way its just bad This is one of the few films that I really really HATE Freddy Got Fingered is in the same category of badbr br So the story in this one goes that the daughter Gugino goes to California to go to school and comes back with Crawl Shore and he tries to learn to be a farmer Then the boyfriend tries to set Shore up so that the girl will leave Crawl and go back to him It ends and whats left of the audience can leavebr br The main purpose of this movie is for Pauly Shore to mug for the camera and try to be funny but Id say about 100 of the time he fails at that Their horrible inaccurate and out of date view of farms and farming is offensive and theres nothing in this movie worth seeing If you think of seeing it dont The one time I saw the movie it felt like I was watching it for 5 or 6 hours If youve already seen it you have my sympathy,negative
I never thought an old cartoon would bring tears to my eyes When I first purchased Casper  Friends Spooking About Africa I so much wanted to see the very first Casper cartoon entitled The Friendly Ghost 1945 But when I saw the next cartoon Theres Good Boos ToNight 1948 It made me break down I couldnt believe how sad and tragic it was after seeing Caspers fox get killed I never saw anything like that in the other Casper cartoons This is the saddest one of all It was so depressing I just couldnt watch it again Its just like seeing Lassie die at the end of a movie I know its a classicBut its too much for us old cartoon fans to handle like me If I wanted to watch something old and classic I rather watch something happy and funny But when I think about this Casper cartoon I think about my cats,positive
I made a big mistake going to see this film Thats the lottery of going to see films I guess After five minutes you just knew it was going to be a clunker and I fought quite hard to stay in my seat  the old lose two hours of your life kind of feelingbr br The fundamental problem is that without even mentioning the whole historical accuracy thread of reviews the script is achingly painful badbr br The first thirty minutes could have been spread out to an hour to give a plausible real plot development Instead it lurched from from one undramatic dramatic event to the next Having the girl cry at the start of the film makes no sense because the audience has no emotional attachment to anything at this point And that whole walking off into the sunset through the longgrass field at the end what the hell was that about br br Not even the excellent Ed Harris could save this one You could almost feel his pain at some of the lines he had to utter The most fabulously awful one was for no apparent reason he stares at the girl as she copies his work in his apartment she looks up it all goes a bit fuzzy romantic kinda lighting or am I dreaming and he says with authority in his voice br br WASH ME br br And she gets up and washes him with a sponge Wash me WTF Thats hilariousbr br And then there was the music The long extended session when it was just Beethoven conducting and the 9th Symphony pouring out of the surround sound in the cinema and the choir waiting waiting standing there silently for what seems like forever And then finally launching into enormous sound It was spinechillingly wonderful and dare I say it it brought tears to my eyesbr br So that is where the film picked up two stars The only part of the film where Beethoven got to say exactly what he wanted to saybr br And I believed him,negative

Let me begin by saying that this remade version of one of the greatest ever created movies Psycho 1960 has been nothing but a fine example of poor direction poor acting and poor cast The best way to describe this movie is by comparing it step by step acting by acting and process by process to the originalbr br Alfred Hitchcock one of the greatest movie directors ever lived had an intention to shoot the original in black and white despite the availability of color at that time Okay people in 1960 may not have been used to bloodshed or horrifying scenes as much as we are today but that didnt prevent people from liking it and getting nominated for 4 Oscars Gus Van Sant had absolutely no reason to release this in color except that the year was 1998 What should have looked realistic in color did not After the shower scene Norman washes his hands it is easily comprehendible that whatever was used for blood looked like some kind of red wax Once he washes off the blood his hand is red in color br br About acting perhaps there couldnt have been a better cast of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins in the original Perkins suited well for Norman and he was incredibly natural when he smiles and talks to the stranger Hitch wanted a handsome and good actor and it worked just fine In this version I personally think Vince Vaughn looked perfect and handsome and strong to play Normans role unfortunately his acting was nothing less than terrible In the motel office where Norman and Marion have the long conversation he had zero expression on his face and his voice and face never changes throughout In the original in the same scene when the madhouse is described we can clearly see the sudden change of expression on Perkinss face and he looks scaringly angry although not aggressively Vince Vaughn here works out the entire conversation like hes just had his lines by heart Again terrible acting Same is with Anne Heche In the opening scene in the original we can see how tensed and nervous Marion Janet is when she drives to Phoenix She was happy in getting the money but at the same time scared for life Thats what I call acting In the remake Heche has no signs of fear and she smiles periodically for getting the money I dont think anyone would be happy and smiling when theyve just stolen 400000 and the entire state police is behind them In the shower scene Janet in the original grips the curtain turns around and dies after getting stabbed In the remake Heche gets stabbed turns around then sways the other way has a foolish expression on her face and manages to die with great effort Again terrible actingbr br There are also some specially introduced changes in this movie from the original that seems to have nothing to do with the plot line and the ongoing situation In the scene where Arbogast gets murdered two scenes blink in between the stabs One with a naked woman and the other with a sheep Many people including myself arent exactly sure whether the second scene showed a sheep or a cow or whatever it was What on earth does a beast or a naked woman have to do with an investigators murder The changes were just inappropriate and unnecessary There are a couple of changes in the ending scene as well br br Let me add some and the only positive points along with that I felt Julianne Moore did her job well and played a good character of Lila And William Macy acted well that was almost exactly how Arbogasts character should have been playedbr br It is common mans knowledge that the purpose and intention of a movie remake is to make the present generation aware of a movie that has a good classic plot line and to try and make it look better than the original And if anything has happened here according to what I just said it is directly the opposite Unfortunately many people like me werent impressed after watching this movie unless we came to know of the existence of an unforgettable original version br br Please do not watch this movie it is nowhere near the original and the original will always remain one of the best ever created movies if not THE best,negative
Bride of Chucky is one of the better horror movies to come out in the past ten years and could be one of the best horror films of the 90sbr br SPOILERSbr br Chuckys girlfriend Tiffany Jennifer Tilly manages to find his battered remains after being sucked into the fan at the end of part 3 and brings him to life in her trailer park Her neighbor Jessie Nick Stabile and his girlfriend Jade Katherine Heigl are being tormented by her uncle John Ritter Tiffany upsets Chucky when he refuses to marry her so she buys a doll for him to play with Chucky kills Tiffany and then transfers her soul into the doll she got him In order for them to be placed back into human bodies they have to travel to New Jersey to retrieve an amulet to do so Jessie sees this as an opportunity to escape from Ritter and they set out on the journey but not before Ritter is killed by Chucky and Tiffany Along the way several bizarre incidents force them to stop at a bed and breakfast When several more people are killed they call up their best friend Gordon Woolvett to straighten out the situation They convince him neither one of them are the killers as the police have began to solve the crimes He finds Ritters body in a trunk in the back of the van Thinking he has been set up he confronts them about it Chucky and Tiffany then turn real to prove they did it which gets Woolvett killed The group steals a motor home and arrives at the cemetery Jessie and Jade get Chucky and Tiffany to turn on each other giving them enough to escape Chucky recaptures Jade and forces her to get his amulet Chucky and Tiffany restart their feud which gives Jessie and Jade enough time to kill the both of them as the police arrive and clears them of the crimesbr br The Good News I have to give the most amount of props to the FX department as Chucky and Tiffany as dolls look completely convincing The scenes with them together are the movies main highlights including a hilarious conversation where Tiffany advises Chucky on how serial killers in the 90s work That being said the amount of oneliners in this movie that are actually funny is incredible Chucky gets the most of them but Tiffany cracks a few gems as well It is actually funnier than what Hollywood calls comedies these days The gore is plentiful and shockingly realistic Several deaths in this movie are actually original and creative Turning Ritter into a new form of Pinhead was a totally brilliant scene The honeymooning couple was a nice death scene as well For teenage love the pairing of Stabile and Heigl works great They have a great chemistry together and actually behave like a normal couple I also have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I did jump during certain scenes and that shows what an incredible job director Yu did He learned enough apparently to do the same thing with Freddy vs Jason He knows how to stage setups and payoffs and here he shows some great skills that have a Hong Kong influenced look and style He could be the next great horror director if he keeps filling up his resume with films like those two Nice soundtrack too like Freddy vs Jasonbr br The Bad News For fans of cheesy movies this will be a great find However this film has a high cheese factor that may prevent the serious horror movie fan from having a good time enjoying this film The film knows it is a cheesy movie and revels in it making a serious fan turned off because of things like the oneliners It isnt all that bad of a movie but it has to be watched in the mind frame that it is a cheesy movie and that the cheesiness of certain scenes add to the movie not to take it away Remove yourself from that state of mind and you may find yourself enjoying this moviebr br The Final Verdict Fans of cheesy movies and the other Childs Play movies will find a lot to like about this movie For serious horror fans take a look at it but keep in mind that it isnt a serious movie and that the cheesiness is supposed to be there and you might find yourself liking itbr br Rated R Graphic Violence Graphic Language Brief Nudity on a doll a shadowy puppet sex scene some drug use and numerous drug references,positive

In my opinion this movie advances no new thought seems to me like taking a spear to a spear without looking to the side the director seems to have an agenda Duh I find that his rational is lacking there does not seem to be room for the alternative view I for one am usually on the side of the naysayer but this movie lacks credibility as it relies on the fantastic observations of the manwoman on the street really now if you wish to cr5eate a credible alternative to a creed held onto for 2000 years you have got to make more of an effort allowing the other side to voice their beliefs Im not sure but at the beginning of the movie it felt like an attack on the Cristian faith I for one am a non believer but allow for the beliefs of others and would not wish no ridicule them but try to understand and tolerate,negative
Remarkable disturbing film about the truelife senseless brutal murder of a smalltown family along with the aftermath and examination of the lives of the killers Dick Hickok and Perry Smithbr br No matter how much time goes by or how dated this film may look it still resonates the utter incomprehensibility of criminal acts such as thisbr br This really traces multiple tragedies The tragedy brutality and senselessness of the murder of the Clutter family a decent farm family in smalltown Holcomb Kansas and the wasted brutal and sad lives of Hickok and Smithbr br An interesting point is made in the film that neither of these two immature scared petty criminals would have ever contemplated going through with something like this alone But together they created a dangerous murderous collective personality one that fed the needs and pathology of each of them They push each other along a road of proving something to each other That they were man enough to do it to carry it out neither wants to be seen as too cowardly to complete their big score an unfortunate and dangerous residue of the desolate lives they led These were two grownup children who live in a criminals world of not backing down from dares who constantly need to prove manhood and toughness in this instance these needs carried right through to the murder of the Cluttersbr br The film contains a somewhat sentimentalized look at the Clutter family but the point is made These were respected lawabiding smalltown people who didnt deserve this terrifying fate The movie also gives us a sense of the young lives of Hickok and Smith Perry Smith whose early life was filled with security and love but watched in horror as alcohol took his family down a tragic path Hickok poor and left pretty much to his own devices not able to see how he fit in using his intelligence and charm to con everyone he came into contact withbr br An interesting and maybe the first look at capital punishment and what ends we hope to achieve Is this nothing more than revenge killing for a murder that rocked a nation at a time when we had not yet had to fully face that there might be such predators among us or does putting these guys at the end of a rope truly provide a deterent to the childish and brutal posturing of men like these Is it possible to deter men who live lives of deceit operating under the radar believing they fool everyone they come into contact with To be deterred you must believe its possible you will be caught Is it possible to deter these men who believe they are too clever to be caught who have committed hundreds of petty crimes and got away with them This was supposed to be a cinch no witnessesbr br When caught Hickok finds he cant charm and con the agents the way he had department store clerks Smith who believes he deserves such a fate anyway who seemed to be the only one who truly grasped the gravity of what they had done willingly tells the story when he learns that Hickok has cowardly caved in Hickok blinked first A silly game of chicken between two immature emotionally damaged dangerous menbr br Fascinating psychological thriller telling a story of a horrendous crime in this nations history Stunning portrayals by Robert Blake and Scott Wilson These roles made their careers,positive
For me it just didnt seem like GI Joe at all When I watched it as a kid I just didnt care for it In fact the part I liked best about this one was the opening credits They change so many facts around and turn the story around as well Cobra Commander is supposedly part of this stupid race of reptile people in Antarctica or somewhere that is frozen Though I always thought he was a normal guy considering every time you saw his eyes in the series they were surrounded by normal colored flesh and not the blue his face was here There is just too much crap in this one to try and make this a spectacular movie but for me it just ruins what I watched the series for in the first place,negative

William Shakespeares plays are classified as comedy tragedy or history Some of his most memorable and most often read  creations provide us with wistful humor gentle poetry and hilarious slapstick Some of them survive as unforgettable dramas of compelling depth and gravity Regardless he was able to write with unparalleled skill and inventiveness contributing greatly to our young language So in what category lies The Merchant of Venice  I was very surprised to find it is one of Shakespeares comedies I had never before read it nor seen it but after watching this most recent film version I have decided it is neither and it is both This is one of many questions the viewer must try to answer when coming to terms with what is clearly a perplexing and deeply troubling moral tragedybr br The players are introduced quickly and simply One of them firstly is Venice itself director Michael Radford filmed the Venetian scenes in the actual city creating an impressively vibrant bustling backdrop to the plays proceedings To this scenery enters the youthful Bassanio Joseph Fiennes returning to Venice to see a dear old friend Antonio Jeremy Irons It seems the poor Bassanio has heard of a princess whose father has died and has left to any potential suitors a lottery of sorts Waiting at the fair ladys island estate are three small trunks br br only one of which contains images of the princess He who can guess the right one using only blind intuition and the cryptic teasers written upon them will be bestowed the fathers huge fortune for life Oh and his daughter and her eternal love in marriage I forgot to mention Here the light comedy of Shakespeare takes over the movie This farcical plot element drives the story and also fills up much of the films screen time as a number of painfully eager opportunists arrive at the island humorously vying for and failing to earn this very wealthy hand in marriage But before any of this occurs Bassanio very much lacking in finances entreats Antonio to loan him three thousand ducats to pay for the lengthy journey he must take to have his shot at the prize br br Antonio himself nearly penniless must reluctantly embrace humility by seeking the financial aid of Shylock Al Pacino one of countless Jewish usurers who keep the sagging economy afloat yet are scorned and persecuted to no end by the citys zealously Christian majority Thus they dwell in societys underbelly and it is here the two borrowers must go Shylock does not hesitate to remind the two men of a certain incident where Antonio insulted and spat on him in the city market and he proudly rebukes this man who frankly has a lot of nerve now coming to ask for help But help him Shylock does He even erases any kind of interest on the loan most likely feeling he has no reason to be concerned if Antonio will be able to repay him within three months Still Shylocks one contractual demand is a pound of Antonios flesh should he renege on their agreement This is an unsettling request to be sure for Antonio and Bassanio as well as for us But it appears that despite his justifiable pride Shylock does not really anticipate seeing such a gruesome act occurring br br So here the dramatic groundwork has been laid And while the film goes off to explore its gentler side with its love lottery and mistaken identities there still looms the gloomy prospect of the loan itself In the end what will become of this ominous agreement Meanwhile we are left at turns to explore the true central character of Shylock Al Pacino has ample dramatic weight to carry here and he does so with convincing grit and passion There are times when he is given room for the theatrics we have come to expect from such a colorful actor But his most impressive scenes are the ones where he internalizes this energy showing a conflicted personality honest sincere and proud yet brooding vengeful and entirely remorseless This is one of Pacinos most heartfelt performances to date And while the rest of the cast play their roles creditably and convincingly it is Pacino who really owns the film  especially toward the end when Shakespeare upends this seeming romantic comedy with a wallop of a third actbr br I shall not reveal much here all I can say is that it involves the initial loan  a mighty shoe one expected would drop sooner or later And does it ever By the end Shakespeare has raised a host of dilemmas for his audience seemingly unresolvable questions of faith morality law and mercy are thrown before us through the final scenes and while by curtains close the playwrights position may seem clear to some we are left completely at odds There are winners and losers in this one but have the winners earned their spoils with good reason or have they in a larger sense ended out losing as well Has virtue been rewarded or simply flouted Has justice in fact this time been just By the plays finish some fates are painfully clear and unequivocally sealed But the audience are to be the ones who really decide the verdict for all of those involved And for some the verdict is still out for the play as well Comedy or tragedy The author has cunningly veiled the intense courtroom finale with an ending of light mirth and pat romantic resolutions Is he saying that all is well that ends well or is this his final ironic condemnation The plays humor serves to set us up nicely for such a heavy crash And while it is also what unfortunately keeps The Merchant of Venice from achieving the greatness of so many of Shakespeares other works it is still engaging amusing and thoughtprovoking beyond measure,positive
The plot of this film contains a few holes you could drive a massive truck through but I reckon that isnt always top priority in horror Two elderly sisters in rural England keep their brother in the cellar since more than 30 years Now he escaped and started a killing spree focusing on militaries that are homed nearby We only did we thought was best for him they keep on repeating and  strangely  all the army officers love these women and dont doubt their sincerity even though 5 of their men died I dont know whether to find the revelation near the end suspenseful  or tedious In a way this film reminded me about Arsenic and Old Lace In that blackcomedy classic two halfinsane siblings mother their goofy younger brother as well yet they do the killing there The old ladies in The Beast in the Cellar are by no means less crazy though The horror in this early 70s film is very amateurish and cheap but there are a few neat attempts to build up the tension Too many oldladies talk about the good ol days though and that rarely is something you seek in a horror film with such an appealing title Flora Robson who may be recognized by classic film buffs plays one of the sisters She gave image to the Queen of England is the legendary Errol Flynn swashbuckler film the Sea Hawk,negative
The plot for a movie such of this is a giveaway How can you go wrong with a gay plot line and all the colors and music of India  a story like this writes itself Ill watch most anything but this was unwatchable The sad thing is the white folks are the most colorful in the film Vanessa was a riot with a mouth like a sailor and Jack was great eye candy but everyone else was so boring Saeed Jeffrey who was exceptional in My Beautiful Landrette did what he could but the story was so boring The saving grace was really the background music which made it OK to laugh at the film instead of with the film or not at all There are many other better gay movies ethnic movies just plain movies I give a lot of low budget movies a pass but this shouldnt have been made or should have been made by someone else,negative
Be With Me is almost the ultimate wallpaper movie Just leave it running in the background chat amongst yourselves and return to it whenever you like and at some point itll end br br Alas as I watched it alone and so I felt like I almost watched the worlds worst longest and most drippingly sentimental beer commercial by the time I just about managed to keep my eyes open as the end credits rolled and I then managed just a a few more moments of wakefulness to witness a Thank you to the movies sponsors  which included Asia Pacific Breweries Aha Methought How surprising is that  given all the shots of Tiger beer interspersed throughout this most forgettable washout of a movie br br Meanwhile dialogue spurts between individuals with occasional stabs at depth but all too usually nothing of any particular advancement to the movies overall story is said or witnessed Its as if one could switch off at any moment and return at any later point and youd really have missed nothing which would have been an unmissable contingency or part of its plot as far as the movies overall progression was concerned Thus the ultimate wallpaper moviebr br Well I wonder What movie were those who positively reviewed this one watching I wonder and continue to wonder It certainly couldnt have been this arty to the point of artless Singaporean excuse for a cameras rolling Allegedly Be With Me is supposed to be woven around the themes of love tragedy and redemption But all I witnessed was boredom a half baked screenplay with a smattering of gormless text messages and the only redemption was that which occurred when this utterly useless movie ended What a wistful waste of time it ended up being It was also said that the characters in this movie were fictitious except for Theresa Chan who is a remarkable woman who has triumphed over adversities Well no disrespect to Ms Chan but given that she was such a marvellous  amazing character why at all did the screenplay have to involve the stories of other characters without the most tenuous attempt to connect their lives together Yet it still proved to be an almost insufferably boring movie whose highlights included the credits rolling Rather than tying in the fates of all characters I really felt that the movie ended up attempting the near impossible and evidently fell between stools as far as any viewer engagement could be concernedbr br I am generally an arthouse movie fan and dont usually object to slow pacing of which here there is no shortage believe you me I hate such movies as 300 Transformers Fight Club but consider eg Eric Rohmer as a great film maker So I hope that puts my criticism into some perspective Nonetheless there was no redeemable feature whatsoever in the entire movies conception and delivery which could prevent ones eyelids slowly drooping downwards as each minute of Be With Me dripped by Watch this movie if you need to feel like wasting time Otherwise your life would be none the richer for having missed it 310,negative
Im not much for cop movies but this one is supposedly a classic  when I found it cheap I bought it and stuck it on a shelf only to finally get around to watching it yesterday and I LIKED it Now you can have New York City but as a setting for a film like this in the winter months its perfect Roy Scheider is a member of an elite police task group called The Seven Ups which are 5 guys that fight crime undercover In an opening scene they recover a shoebox full of money from an antique store by distracting the crooks with a bull in a china shop routine But thats only the beginning Seems that there are two guys posing as cops that are kidnapping mob types and holding them for ransom Richard Lynch happens to be one of these sleazebags and hes as creepy as ever When one of the Seven Ups who is posing as a limo driver at a funeral gets his cover blown hes beaten and stuffed into the trunk of a car which then leads to perhaps one of the most exciting car chases Ive seen Amazing though how light traffic in NYC is for chase scenes but still this is rather amazing as Scheider follows the two kidnappers through what Im guessing is the Bronx and then onto a turnpike and then eventually Scheiders car comes to a screeching halt in one of the most heartstopping finales to a chase scene that Ive ever witnessed Anyway since the cop ends up dying Scheider and his men are under suspicion because the police commissioner knows so little about their activities he wonders if THEYRE on the make by kidnapping mobsters so of course this kind of thinking needs to be nipped in the bud  Scheider is relentless getting to the bottom of things Overall a decent cop actiondrama not really my thing but I liked this one Look for Joe Spinell Maniac in a small role 7 out of 10,positive
This is one of the few movies that was recommended to me as absolutely brilliant that really is If you give this movie a low note than you really missed the point You could describe Fosca as manipulative but what if it is really serious that she gets ill when the love she is sure of isnt answered But what would you do when you are sure that the other one loves you and is only rejected by the fact that you are ugly Wouldnt you fight for it At least I think it is better to fight for it that die in bitterness And it reminds me of the fact how I as a man react at first sight completely on the physical ugliness of Fosca and dont look further at the person she is or might be This movie confronts me with very solemn questions about respect trust feeling manipulated and so on How do I now if someone manipulates me or is just trying everything to make contact What I think to be the most outstanding feature in this movie is that Ettore Scola made it absolutely believable that Giorgio falls in love with Fosca,positive
I love this movie so much It always makes me cry If you appreciate Drew Barrymore half as much as I do youll love this movie Its got all the essentials I look for in a movie It has good actors good characters good humora lot of heartwarming moments too The flashback moments when we see Josie in high school make me cry though Every single time Im sure youll like this one dont judge based on the fact that it looks like a teen movie even though it is in a way a teen movie Sure if youre a guy and all you watch are hardcore special effect movies only in the top 250 movies of all time then this isnt for you But if you like romantic comedies you will not forget after seeing it pick it up at a video store and enjoy Drew Barrymore is great in this one,positive

This movie purports to show a middle class familys attempt to figure out what is going down in the America of the late 1960s Their trip to a rock festival is as far as their refurbished old bus gets Without exception the characters are superficial stereotypesbr br If you want to know which wellestablished Hollywood actors were desperate for a paycheck in those days just look at the credits Sal Mineo I had forgotten just how badly his career had hit the skids Thank God his career rebounded before his untimely deathbr br The writers on this television turkey were clueless Outside of doing weed their insights into the hippie movement were laughable,negative
If you ever plan on renting hopefully not buying this movie think again It was as if Gary Busey had a gun to his head and was forced to act or die I only wonder if Busey was arrested for something and was sentenced to play in this movie because I just dont see the guy that acted so much better with Keanu Reeves in Point Break play in this disaster It was a feelgood movie but there are thousands of other feelgood movies that make you laugh without wanting you to get your money backbr br The only reason I would ever tell someone to rent this movie is to watch this movie is to see Gary Busey jump up and down like a monkey If you want a good funny movie pass up Quigley and go rent Spongebob or something,negative
Bad bad bad How do movies like this get made Badly written poorly acted I could go on but why bother As an aside note that the characters first names are the same as the actors playing them  this is a dead giveaway that no one on the set is even interested enough in their role to bother learning someone elses characters names,negative

Man this was hilarious It should be under COMEDY Or STUPID It would have made realizing what a pile of stank this was much easier Seriously I want anyone associated with this movie tased effective immediately For everyone who is thinking of watching this movie lets go over a few plot points Oh wait There arent any There is literally no plot I think Casper Van Dien was bored and he decided to film something with some random someones and miraculously it somehow got on videotape This movie is literally the worst movie of all time Dont believe me Go watch it Do it man I dare you But be prepared to gouge your eyes out If you can sit through this without blowing a cow you are very strong and courageous,negative

Once again we are fortunate to see a gorgeous opening scene where the artists work has been fully restored and we see this oldtime grocery store on a street corner with the snow gently falling Inside are the rich colors of all the merchandise from produce to canned and boxed goods to medicine to candy etcbr br In essence this is a story of those goods coming to life such as the animals on the labels of items or a pie or even a pack of cigarettesbr br The whole show is narrated by Jack Bunny a Jack Benny impersonator with music from conductor Leopold Stokowski who was in so many Looney Tunes animated shorts I have lost count A lot of the humor is topical so it pays to know who Little Egypt and other characters The Busby Berkeleytype aqua number with bathing suitedsardines coming out of the can and the tomato cancan dance were both clever br br All of the above and more was in the first half of this slightly longerthannormal length cartoon The second half was about a King Kongtype which escapes from the Animal Crackers box and terrorizes everyone That part was not much and ended on a somewhat stupid note So an A for the first half a D for the second making it about a Cplus or Bminus overall,positive
Ill say one thing about this film there are no lulls You cant get bored watching this The problem is that it is TOO intense There is too much action and it NEEDS lulls That is the risk you take in modern action films You want it interesting but not overdone This is way overdonebr br Even though the acting is fine and features a couple of names in Gary Busey and Roy Scheider it still has the feel of a B film The best part of it is Scheiders dialog the only A part of this B filmbr br The rest of the story is strictly Rambo mentality but did have a few standout scenes One in particular was a very innovative scene featuring land mines That was memorable Not enough of the other scenes were to make this a keeper for long,negative
Bad dialog slow story scenes that drag on and are absolutely pointless I cant believe this much money was invested in such a poorly written film The directing and acting couldnt save this bomb eitherbr br 50 through the movie and youre still waiting for it to start They lay the foundation with the opening preface and then spend the next 40 minutes setting up NOTHING You watch 40 minutes of footage that is absolutely directionless in an attempt to do what I have no ideabr br Much of this film is like watching a really bad french movie where nothing ever happens and the characters are just sort of dull lifeless and egocentrics living without purpose or carebr br Avoid this film at all cost Anyone that recommends it is setting you up for disappointment and you will undoubtedly question their taste and depth,negative
I cant believe that those praising this movie herein arent thinking of some other film I was prepared for the possibility that this would be awful but the script or lack thereof makes for a film thats also pointless On the plus side the general level of craft on the part of the actors and technical crew is quite competent but when youve got a sows ear to work with you cant make a silk purse Ben G fans should stick with just about any other movie hes been in Dorothy S fans should stick to Galaxina Peter B fans should stick to Last Picture Show and Target Fans of cheap laughs at the expense of those who seem to be asking for it should stick to Peter Bs amazingly awful book Killing of the Unicorn,negative
The plot doesnt offer any new excitements it even starts the same as cube I This time there are no other enhancements for the cube machinery except for having an extra exit which is not guarded very ingenious The characters are also not so well elaborated as in the first episode they just became flat as in a soap opera br br If somebody makes it to the normal exit the person would be asked some questions like do you believe in god its not really creative or original and especially in my opinion it doesnt fit into the mystery of the cube with it traps Really there is nothing much else to say about it,negative
Okay it features one lovely blinkandyoumissitjoke when the dead are rising from their tombs the names of the old time horror directors like Jacques Tournier and Jean Yarborough are featured in the tombstones and the smashing of morally bankrupt Repuconrightist villains is ontarget whorish skanks preaching morals etc But why these soldiers are antiRepublicans Because they have gone to the war most of them should be Republicans right Why they dont go to killing the enemies who killed them or something Why they ALL want to vote against the Republicans Why this story has made of a movie Questions never answered,negative
When I was 8 years old and going through my Marx Brothers phase my father read in the TV Guide that they were showing the Marx Brothers film The Big Store late on Friday night and set the VCR to tape it for me When I woke up on Saturday  due no doubt to a misprint in the TV guide  my father and I discovered The Story of Mankind had been recorded insteadbr br The Big Store was probably one of the least funny of all the Marx Brothers movies and nevertheless it stands as one of the centurys finest works of cinema when compared with The Story of Mankind I can almost justify TV Guides error in that the Marx Brothers  Groucho Chico and Harpo  appear in both movies Although in The Story of Mankind they are divided up into a series of unrelated scenes Groucho plays Peter Minuit Chico plays some guy talking to Christopher Columbus and Harpo plays Isaac Newton Harpos scene lasts about half a minute Chico only has two or three lines Grouchos scene is at least funny but horribly racially insensitive by todays standards The rest of the movie doesnt bear mentioning They trotted out some of the finest actors of the day and made them recite total garbage What a disappointmentbr br TV Guide I sent you a nice letter Im still waiting for an apologybr br For the record The Big Store has a wonderful bit of physical comedy with the Marx Brothers on roller skates and a couple of songs by Virginia OBrien I was really looking forward to seeing it,negative
I bought this movie from Gamestops discount used movie bin and the cover caused me to laugh uncontrollably so I bought it for 99cents The movie itself is retarded and they use like ten different monkeys throughout the whole film that hardly look alike Not to mention they use a stunt double who is just a short guy in costume making a desperate attempt to impersonate a monkeybr br The director more than likely committed a murdersuicide with the chimpanzees after the movie debuted in a preview for some other low rent Warner Bros film and he ended up owing money to the studio It also doesnt help that he wasnt even infamous for the terrible job he did he wasnt even known for producing a poopchute filmbr br Why was this movie ever made,negative
This was the most thoughtprovoking capitalpunishment movie ever It refused to seem onesided and the emotions felt throughout the story are as real as it can get This movie had one of the most human And I use this term in a good way compassionate religious character ever This movie actually caused me to go out to find and read the book Which is rare for me Sister Helen exerted more of a spiritual tone than a religiousWhich is also rare And it presented both sides to the issue so that people on both sides who watched the movie wouldnt feel that a point was left out And we have the director to thank for that This is not a film for entertainment But it is film that delivers a message that can reach to the core of your heart I cant think of another film like it,positive
This is the ultimate of horror movies this year House of Wax is one of the scariest movies Ive ever seen This version really puts the Vincent Price version of the movie to shame I only know a few of the young cast in the movie The ever troublesome Paris Hilton the pain in the you know what seems to be more seductive than ever At least she didnt try to copy her infamy Well if she likes to do horror shes better than Wheel of Fortunes Vanna White She beats Vanna HANDS DOWN And the scene of where House of Wax was made was no joke The house was made of wax and the victims were able to get out of there before the get waxed like their friends Those two twins Bo and Vincentthe deformed twins were maniacs from the getgo The parents raised them well except for Vincent And I think they became equally warped How come the the one in the other pickup happen to be creepy but not as bad as the other two Thats another story in the book I guess he had to follow his heart and not the other twins who turned Ambrose into a tourist trap for unsuspecting victims This movie is like The Phantom of the Opera meets The Rocky Horror Picture Show And this movie is one of the scariest one in 2005 Rating 4 out of 5 stars,positive
Nevsky is one of the great epic war films Sure others such as Birth of a Nation and Napoleon had come before but this one is just as influential The acting is stock but anyone who knows the first thing about Eisenstein would know that that was part of his theory of film This film unlike many of his silent works is about the heroic individual as much as it is about the group This reflects the Stalinist philosophy that had risen to the fore by 1938 Still his film shows us the power that can be generated by people coming together to fight something they perceive as evil Nevsky is just one of many men He is prince because he is strongest but not because he is somehow different than the rest The films romantic angles provide more of a personal story than Eisenstein had previously allowed Not all of the elements work and the film is probably a bit too long but it still resonates,positive
Dont let any reviews critics IMDb users or mine influence you seeing this movie I read only the plot premise and became intrigued After watching this movie in my opinion is definitely worth seeing It gives a perspective on life that many have probably not contemplated Its is not however as Leland himself says a movie that can be wrapped up in a neat package with a bow and everything Other user reviews on this website claim to have a psychological background and imply that the story is not feasible Quite obviously they missed the entire point of the movie which is disappointing to say the leastbr br In short it is a well acted well directed movie The story is not a feel good one but I feel if you dont come away from the movie feeling good you may just have missed something To characterize it as art house is unfair in my opinion but as our society likes labels this is probably the one that fits If you find you know everything there is to know about the world Id suggest skipping this one If you feel movies should be a form of escape from the world you wont find it here But if you do watch it you just might find something in yourself,positive
I rented this film thinking it was the sobbingly sad 1959 version I saw as a kid It was not I was therefore very disappointed with what I felt was marginal acting poor character development and most of all failure to highlight the relationship between the boy and his dog In this version the Dog of Flanders is just a cute aside to the movie Get the 1959 version,negative
Although this was a film of only less than forty minutes it is one of best directed and acted stories I have ever seen It accomplishes in less than 45 minutes what most films cannot in more than 90br br It is the story of two brothers one 18 and the other 10 They come from a poor farm family in Mississippi Both are caught up in war and the conflict of duty verses love of familybr br It brought tears to my eyes especially because the entire film is so well acted and directed plus it tells the story of so many wars where one serves and the other left behindbr br I can fully recommend this film as beyond superb ,positive
This has got to be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen There were people leaving the theatre others were falling asleep ok it was a late night show This is a nosense movie one of those who can make you never want to see an out of mainstream picture again I would love to watch the makingoff of this movie as I am deeply interested on what goes on the minds of the authors of such garbage Do they laugh when they create all this ridiculous stuff or do they actually think theyre doing something interesting I wonder The soundtrack is awful apart from some instrumental stuff that reminds you of a previous Bjork album Even if youre a fan of Bjorks music stay home Its the best thing to do The little tiny pieces of nice music are no reason for you to go out and submit yourself to this torture God,negative
One of my favorite movies to date starts as an adventure through the wild side of a team of four men from Atlanta The idea of living the Chulawasse river before its turned into a lake comes from Burt Reynolds Lewis who unconsciously drowns his fellas into their worst nightmare But if the first half of the film appears rather like an action movie the second half carries the viewer into a totally different story with our men forced to make a decision that they know will change their lives forever In very bad ways At the end of the movie each person is gonna be forced to deal with the scars of what had just to be a quite weekend on the river but muted into a fight for survival The movie except some pretty evident goofs is very well directed and beautifully shot into a paradise of nature that steals your breath The photography is excellent as well Voight Reynolds Cox and Beatty are all excellent in showing how a single event can ruin in different ways four different lives only tied to the same mistake,positive
The nexttolast episode aired of the original Star Trek series is an interesting sometimes melancholy installment that proves the show was still exploring its characters even at this point in the third season though flawed All Our Yesterdays has its moments and overall a moody compelling feel to it Kirk Spock and McCoy beam down to a planet assuming they are arriving in the nick of time to save or at least give some warning to whatever populace is there since the planets sun is due to explode within hours But as it turns out the people there are all too aware of the planets fate and using a kind of time travel device have escaped into the past Each person has been able to choose the time and place in the past where he or she would like to live at a library run by an elderly man named Mr Atoz Atoz assumes the three men are looking for a past to live in as well and shows them various periods from which they can choose on viewers There is some rather forced confusion at the start of the episode with lines likebr br McCoy Where did they go Atoz Wherever they wanted tobr br The misunderstanding could be cleared up rather easily but for plot purposes it isnt and soon Kirk finds himself transported back to a period resembling 18th Century England while Spock and McCoy are sent to an ice age 5000 years in the planets past From here the main focus is on Spock and his relationship with a woman exiled to this time by a tyrant as punishment Spock begins acting increasingly emotional showing anger toward McCoy and deep affection for Zarabeth the woman He eventually realizes that he is reverting back to the primitive emotional state of his ancestors on Vulcan 5000 years ago Kirk makes his way back to the library first and finally convinces Mr Atoz they dont belong in his planets history Spock and McCoy return just before its too late leaving Zarabeth behind the Enterprise beams the three up and speeds away as the sun explodes destroying the planet The interaction between Spock and Zarabeth provides this episodes most memorable moments though Kirks adventure into the English past is amusing All in all a very decent latterday Star Trek outing,positive

Set mostly in the back streets of Toronto NG is a dark  mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman  Vern and Sarah   each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past  Fine dialogue and firstrate casting propel this low key noirish journey into the girls search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life Aided by her  anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest  but with a price to be paid The film never intends to answer all of its mysteries  but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists,positive
Tripping Over I must say at first I was a little disappointed in the first few episodes but having faith in the show and Abe Forsythes unquestionable talent I continued to watch I can safely say Im now glad that I did The story did develop quite well and all the characters have a strong base and most dont have any information missingbr br The only thing I can fault in this production is the somewhat annoying voice and pronunciation possessed by the character Lizziebr br Some good acting coupled with a stellar plot really gets this show over the line Heres to hoping for another season,positive
I recently bought this movie on DVD at a discount store for 5 Although it is a nofrills DVD on the Geneon label just the movie that starts playing immediately  no menu no special features the picture and sound quality were EXCELLENT The movie is based on the true story of one of the biggest bank robberies in historybr br Richard Jordan who I must admit to not having heard of plays the lead  Pinky Green A charming young man who had spent too much of his few years in prison and now wanted to go straight but is not allowed to do so He portrays an American in England David Niven plays the lead bad guy also with the great charm for which he is famous Bad but with scruples as when he refuses to deny Pinky his whack for the job Whack in England apparently is the fair share of the take and not a bullet in the head as in American gangster films All the supporting cast do an excellent job producing a very believable moviebr br What is perhaps best to me is that the whole movie is quite enjoyable and understandable I frequently find myself lost in plot confusions and various characters without ANY special effects NO blood No violence Not even a single car chase Just a well written story well acted well directed and well photographed If I had any complaints about the movie I would question the music WHAT is bluegrass music doing in a bank heist story that takes place in England,positive

There is a lot of talk of torture these days Thats all this movie is Its about a good person who makes a bad decision Because of his kindness he becomes vulnerable to two psychotic women From then on its a justforkicks assault on him I dont know at what point you do something about it There is a wife and child out there somewhere he has great feelings of guilt and fear But there should have been some times when he could have acted The movie seems to be somebodys joke I suppose in the wake of the Manson murders we had a bit of a fixation on the likes of these two Nevertheless why would someone make a film like this What appeals does it have except for sadism The conclusion is totally unsatisfying but that could have been remedied with an obvious plot twist Oh well Another hour and a half of my life,negative
Its particularly hard for a director to capture filmmaking without getting precious inbred overdramatic or all three Breillat ably demonstrates the instinctive lizardbrain methods of a female auteur in extracting from two cattle as Hitchcock called actors a lovescene of searing intimacy Her main battle is with her leading man an actor is really a woman she opines although naturally it is the leading lady who will steal the show I disagree that this is Breillats first comedy Romance was at various points hilarious but I accept that the French sense of humour can be elusive for foreigners indeed dozens of IMDb reviewers detected no comedy in Romance By contrast Sex Is Comedy raises plenty of laughs mainly by using an actors prop that goes back thousands of years to Plautus and the ancient Greeks We wondered leaving the theatre whether Roxanes beard was a wig A lovely performance from Anne Parillaud as Breillat wrestling with her own script looking ten years younger than her age,positive

I saw this movie for the first time a little over a year ago Ive seen it 4 more times since I had never heard of it before and I consider myself knowledgeable of classic cinema A true polished diamond in the roughbr br This gem of a movie revolves around Jon Voight lead character Conrack as a young schoolteacher assigned to Yamacraw Island to teach the islands children all in one school At first the students reveal they know very little of the world beyond their island home The heart of the movie is Conrack finding inspiration to awaken their young minds to the world around them The students quickly reward their teacher with an eagerness to learn and a remarkable ability to grasp concepts that only a short time before had been foreign to them Conrack uses unconventional and clever teaching techniques that happen to be oh a little fun God forbid Learning AND fun Together Cant be or so says the ones in charge To avoid a spoiler I shall just say that Conrack finds resistance with the boss manand the ending is truly bittersweetbr br I am a 35 year old white male with some teaching experience so I should identify with the lead character Pat Conroy aka Conrack Mr Petroy But I dont I identify with the black kids As a kid I was bussed to the school on the other side of town from the 4th to the 6th grade circa 1979 These kids in the movie remind me of my classmates then Luckily in 4th grade as a 8 or 9 year old one doesnt understand racism I just remember we were all being kids playing 4square kickball hideandseek and running relaysbr br This movie is very moving There are delightful and poignant moments from beginning to end nonstop I found myself many times with tears in my eyes then suddenly laughing out loud Its a funny moviebr br Git away from that winda Sir if youre prepared to accept crap I should tell you that rabbit just did it in your lap So you the white schoolteacher Mr Conrack My grands LOVE Mr Conrack You a good looking teacher you a good looking white man wind 15 mph from the east Small boat warning Small boats beware Big boats OK dont gotta worry bout nothing not a fry cook but Eleanor Roosevelt not a sharecropper but something Latinthats Latinhey wait Conrack sing like a frogI sing good whatcha talkin boutbr br It still mystifies me that I still hear nothing about this movie or that it has very little reputation or following I intend to seek out more reviews comments background and making of tidbits if they are out there What amazes me is the acting given from the untrained kids One of the kids Mary I understand was an actress and you can tell However the other kids have plenty of lines and genuine reactions I wonder how they did it Im guessing that Conrack and Mary had precise dialogue to work with while some of the scenes unfold naturally or adlibbedbr br Conrack is a special movie In my opinion it is one of the very few movies that are so good AND so unknown Others in that category are King Rat 65 Dark Passage 47 with Bogie and Bacall Gods Must Be Crazy 80 and Bad Day at Black Rock 55 I recommend them all But first take a seat in the class of Mr Conrack,positive
Anyone who critiques Jacqueline Hyde as anything more than the playful and undeniably erotic romp that its intended to be is just not playing with a full deck Just from the title its obvious that this low budget horror comedy isnt meant to be taken seriously its as tongue in cheek as a nymphos french kiss and just as titillating The female cast members are all great and fun to watch Check this out Rolfe Kanefsky is the clownprince of softcore horror Unlike most softcore horror flicks this one is entertaining all the way through with charismatic and exceptionally attractive actresses The movie doesnt even attempt to follow the storyline of the Robert Louis Stevenson classic but instead seeks out every way possible to create risqué sight gags and erotic situations Blythe Metz the brunette femme fatale who portrays the sexier homicidal side of Jacqueline is a real knockout Watch and enjoy,positive

An Itch In Time is one of a string of home runs Bob Clampett hit for WB in the early 1940s including Horton Hatches The Egg and Tortoise Wins By A Hare Soaked in manic timing and exaggerated mayhem its basically the saga of a flea whos busy breaking ground for a new home and the dog whose ground is being broken Because master Elmer will give him a dreaded flea bath if he so much as scratches the unlucky canine is forced to endure an upward spiral of torment as the homesteading flea uses pickaxes and power tools to clear the land Ultimately the little monster lights the fuse to a small mountain of high explosives hes piled onto his victims backside Theres a tremendous explosion and the hapless pooch covers his eyes as his rear end erupts in a blazing Fourth of July display That really has to hurt and the dog takes flight but soon he stops the action and says with a merry smile You guys better cut it out cause I think Im starting to like it For years this kinky confession was censored but current prints have restored the clip so now viewers can enjoy it in its original devilish glory Still cut however is the closing gag in which the cat blows his brains out after he laments Now Ive seen everything This was a common gag at WB but it has since been purged from this cartoon and several others including Horton,positive
In my opinion this movies title should be changed from Only the Brave to All About Lane I went to a screening of this film a few months ago and was quite disappointed with the outcome Although I appreciate that the director made a movie about the men of 442nd  a subject matter that long deserved addressing in the film industry  the acting in some parts of film was quite stale The performances of Marc Dacascos Tamlyn Tomita and Jason Scott Lee were all great However the director should have NEVER put himself as the main character in the movie Sorry Lane you are just not a film actor Stick to what youre good at  theater acting Gina Hiraizumis performance in this film was also horrible She should never have been given a speaking role and her looks were unfit to play the part of a Miss Nisei queen There were other young actresses in the film who were naturally beautiful and whose performances were wonderful Why werent they cast for that role Another major problem with this film were its action sequences The JapaneseAmerican soldiers dont look like they were fighting German soldiers let alone anyone Granted this was a low budget feature but since this was a warbased film isnt it important to show some actually fighting This film was a worthy attempt but definitely not worth a major distribution,negative

Madhur Bhandarkar directs this film that is supposed to expose the lifestyle of the rich and famous while also providing a commentary on the integrity of journalism todaybr br Celebrities party endlessly they like to be seen at these parties and to get due exposure in the media In fact the film would have us believe that this exposure MAKES celebrities out of socialites and the newspapers have a huge hand in this IMO there is much more synergy between the celebrities and media and it is a I need you you need me kind of relationship However the media needs celebrities more and not vice versa Anyhow in this milieu of constant partying is thrown the social column page 3 of the newspaper reporter Konkana Sen Sharma She is shown as this celebrity maker very popular at the social gatherings She has a good friend in the gay Abhijeet and in the struggling model Rohit Bikram Saluja She rooms with an airhostess  the sassy Pearl Sandhya Mridul and a struggling actress  Gayatri Tara Sharma The editor of the newspaper is Boman Irani and a firebrand crime beat reporter is played by Atul Kulkarni The movie has almost too many plot diversions and characters but does work at a certain level The rich are shown to be rotten to the core for the most part the movie biz shown to be sleazy to the max with casting couch scenarios exploitation of power hunger for media exposure Into all this is layered in homosexuality a homosexual encounter that seems to not have much to do with the story or plot rampant drug use pedophilia police encounter deaths In light of all this Pearls desire to have a super rich husband a socialite daughter indulging in a sexual encounter in a car the bitching women all seem benign illsbr br The film has absolutely excellent acting by Konkana Sen Sharma Atul Kulkarni has almost no role  a pity in my opinion But the supporting cast is more than competent Boman Irani is very good This is what saves the film for me Mr Bhandarkar bites off way more than he can chew or process onto celluloid and turns the film into a free for all bash I wish he had focused on one or two aspects of societal ills and explored them more effectively He berates societal exploitation yet himself exploits all the masala ingredients needed for a film to be successful We have an item number in the framework of a Bollywood theme party the drugged out kids dance a perfectly choreographed dance to a Western beat I hope the next one from Madhur Bhandarkar dares to ditch even more of the Hindi film stereotyped ingredients The film is a brave albeit flawed effort certainly worth a watch,positive
OK so Mr Agramas company which is involved in some dubious business with former Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi produced a horrendous mishmash by a Mr Carl Macekbr br What is this horrendous mishmash Im talking about Well Macek took three entirely unrelated Japanese scifi animated series namely Macross Southern Cross and Mospeada added TONS of dialogue  believing firmly that the American audience is too dumb to understand the narrative and artistic virtue of silence   edited the whole lot heavily for violent content added some metaphysical mumbo jumbo dubbed it using some of the worst voice actors this side of acting Hell Reba Wests singing was  and still is  unbearable and a total outrage especially compared to Mrs Mari Iijima And the result was an 85episode series with hundreds of continuity problems and plot holesbr br Of course the mecha were cool to look at especially those in the Macross Saga and the plot parts that remained unscathed were good But whatever was good about Robotech was not the result of Maceks work or the voice talents he recruited It was because of the toils and efforts of the uncredited  why would I be too bold to accuse HG of plagiarism here Japanese creators Those of us who eventually got wind of the real deal and compared the originals to Robotech now wish we had never been exposed to Robotech The originals are so much better naturally and make a lot more sensebr br Robotech however DID something worthwhile it prompted legendary anime creator Leiji Matsumoto to start a campaign for the protection of Japanese anime creators intellectual property from such unauthorized and uncalledfor reworkings that talentless people like Carl Macek produce,negative
While credited as a Tom and Jerry cartoon this is not the catandmouse team but an earlier MuttandJeff ripoff featuring them going to Africa and disguising themselves in the stereotypical burnt cork makeup to try to blend in While the dialect humor is mostly lame there is a brief musical sequence involving black skeletons that was entertaining I have to ask however how could Tom and Jerry still have their makeup stay on even after being dumped in the water a couple of times One of many entries produced by the Van Beuren Corporation for distribution by RKO Radio Pictures before RKO made a deal with Disney Only worth seeing if youre an animation buff or is interested in how certain ethnicities were stereotyped as entertainment way back when,negative
I have watched anime but Im not a die hard fan and I dont read manga I say this because many of the reviewers who are waxing lyrical about this film seem to have that background I have seen St Johns Wort and although it isnt a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination it made me pick up Shinobi especially since everyone seems to love itbr br Well I watched it this afternoon and fought very hard to keep watching Yes its very beautiful  the slow motion water scenes the autumn leaves on the trees even the CGI eye flicker  majestic I liked the hawk the costumes even some of the fight scenes but overall this was dull as dirtbr br It seemed as if someone took Romeo and Juliet  the translation even mentions that they are star crossed lovers  and threw in some XMen for good measure Two of the characters split Wolverines powers  the guy dressed in a bear costume had his claws and the greyhaired guy had his ability to heal himself Then you have the girl who has a poison kiss  thats Poison Ivy from Batman Why do they give these women such dumb powers Poison girl shows her leg then kisses you to death Man thats some great power for you And the other girl can create bugs from this yellow dust that she rubs on her hands The other woman one of the star crossed lovers has the power of a hypnotic stare Wowbr br I sort of made it to the end of the film by fast forwarding it and did see a bit more tragedy than I expected Some people are comparing this to House of Flying Daggers and Hero Dont make that mistake They may share similar endings but thats where the similarities end Shinobi is made by an amateur  the other films are made by an experienced filmmakerbr br I would say avoid this film unless youre 12 to 18 years old,negative
This is one of my two or three favorite Stooges shorts and undoubtedly Christine McIntyres best performance with the trio She is good in a number of other shorts but here she is absolutely brilliant Her singing is not funny at all in fact it is downright beautiful but the plot is constructed in such a way that the singing enhances the humor rather than detracting from it We listen to McIntyre sing the entirety of Voice of Spring no less than three times but it never gets old partly because we dont tire of her voice and partly because it blends so well with the Stooges antics The use of operatic soprano in a comedy is reminiscent of Kitty Carlisles role in the Marx Brothers A Night At The Opera but the singing is much more a part of the comedy here than in Opera and McIntyre perhaps more in other performances than here exhibited a comedic talent of her own that Carlisle never did The Stooges buffoonery McIntyres singing and a wellconstructed plot combine for 5 out of 5 stars,positive
Talk about a blast opening Trampa Infernal has the coolest opening credits ever Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary Friday the 13th theme TshTshTshHaHaHa the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasherbackwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes Two extremely competitive and testosteroneoverloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar According to a newspaper article theres a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters that tried to catch it The challenge includes that whoever kills the bear will be declared the ultimate macho hero with the biggest set of balls Upon arrival however it quickly becomes obvious theyre not up against a bear but a bewildered and utterly maniacal war veteran with quite an arsenal of weapons in his hideout and numerous combat tricks up his sleeve After a whole decade of tame and derivative American slashers this early 90s Mexican effort looks and feels very refreshing and vivid The formula is simplistic but efficient the lead characters are plausible enough and the building up towards the confrontations with the sadist killer is reasonably suspenseful The maniac must have been a fan of Freddy Krueger and Michael Myers as he also uses a selfmade glove with sharp knives attached to it and a white mask to cover his face The murders are pleasingly nasty and barbaric which I was really hoping for since the awesome aforementioned opening sequences and waste a whole lot of gratuitous blood The forestry setting and particularly the camouflaged booby traps are joyously spectacular Trampa Internal is a Mexican slashersurvival sleeper hit that comes warmly recommended to the fans of the genre,positive
Zen and the Art of Lanscaping written and directed by David Kartch is a short film about a young man named David his friends call him Zen and what transpires in one strange day of his life Zen works as a lanscaper for an uppermiddle class family The lady of the house tries to get Zen to help her cheat on her husband Unfortunately her son walks in on them instead of her husband From this point on the movie starts to speed through many revelations between the characters along with the eventual involvement of the man of the house Zen and the Art of Landscaping is witty smart and overall very well written The comedic timing of the actors is also very strong Its a fun light movie that I would strongly recommend,positive
Blank Check is easily one of the worst films of the nineties The plot is completely pointless its overtones of lonliness are pathetic Do you really believe a twelve year old acting as a personal assistant for a millionaire could accomplish everything in this film like buying a mansion for a mere 300 grand The notion let alone the bargainbasement price will only be believed by the most gullible viewers Please respect your intelligence and dont watch this awful awful film,negative
This is one of those movies that you keep thinking about when you wake up the next morning It will give you that warm fuzzy feeling and leave you with a smile on your facebr br Sure we get fed the typical stereotype characters and stories but it does do the trick Entertainbr br Being from Sweden and living in the US for quite sometime it is funny how we react The deadbeat husband is going to kill him She Gabriella is going to die and then there will be a heartbreaking largerthanlife ending We know how these things work everything comes together at the end And it did The characters were somewhat simple they were so elaborate that you didnt really think twice about it nothing was really left for your own imagination The closest would probably be Siv she makes you ask yourself if she indeed was in love with Daniel but thats about itbr br But the movie is beautiful set in rural Norrland the music is absolutely amazing and the characters are lovable Michael Nyqvist is truly genius with his crazy unique look and Frida Hallberg is charming and approachable Maybe a little too nicebr br But most of all this movie makes you feel and that is the most important thing You cry you laugh you hate and you identify I dont know about you guys but that does not happen that often,positive
I dont understand None of this makes any sense exclaims one exasperated character towards the end of Death Smiles at Murder Having just sat through this thoroughly confusing mess of a movie I know exactly how he feels The story by the films director Aristide Massacessi good old Joe Damato using his real name for a change is a clumsy mix of the supernatural murdermystery and pretentious arty rubbish the likes of which will probably appeal to those who admire trippy 70s garbage such as Jess Francos more bizarre efforts but which had me struggling to remain consciousbr br Opening with a hunchback mourning the death of his beautiful sister with whom he had been having an incestuous affair before eventually losing her to a dashing doctor Death Smiles at Murder soon becomes very confusing when the very same woman played by Ewa Aulin who stars in the equally strange Death Laid an Egg is seen alive and kicking the sole survivor of a coach accident that occurs outside the estate of Walter and Eva von Ravensbrück After being invited to stay and recuperate in their home where she is tended to by creepy Dr Sturges Klaus Kinski in a throwaway role the comely lass begins love affairs with both Mr and Mrs Ravensbrück meaning that viewers are treated to some brief but welcome scenes of nookie and lesbian lovinbr br So far so good I thought to myself at this point weve had hunchbacks incest some blood and guts and gratuitous female nudityall ingredients of a great trashy Eurohorror what follows however is a lame attempt by Massacessi to combine giallo style killings ghostly goings on and even elements from Edgar Allan Poes The Black Cat to tell a very silly utterly bewildering and ultimately extremely boring tale of revenge from beyond the gravebr br This film seems to have quite few admirers here on IMDb but given the choice I would much rather watch one of the directors sleazier movies from later in his career I guess incomprehensible meandering surreal 70s Gothic horror just aint my thing 25 out of 10 purely for the cheesy gore and nekkidness rounded up to 3 for IMDb,negative
Honestly when I saw this movie years ago I immediately wanted to turn it off As I sat there for the next 10 minutes or so I realized that the actor playing Navin stole the show His facial expressions and comedic demeanor makes me shake my head as to WHY he hasnt been in more comedies He has this Marty Feldman thing going for him but MUCH MUCH more talenttaking nothing away from Marty The movie really shocked me by how close it was to the original Jerk but then again it was SO MUCH MORE I really think that if this movie was released first and I saw the Steve Martin movie 2nd Id think the 2nd was a cheap ripoff I know it sounds like a BOLD statement but its true I actually like Steve Martin a great deal but his performance is 2nd to the actor in The Jerk Too I wish I could get a copy of it for my collection I urge you to see it if you can find it,positive

this could be one of the worse movies ive ever seen i dont see how could this ever be described as a horror movie or even a thriller its more like a lumbering drama the scary music is EXCELLENT but since there werent any scary situations the director thought it would be a good idea to use it for everyday activities like taking a dump or walking down stairs the movie had so much potential they had beautiful cinematography sp and interesting characters but it seemed as if the writers assumed you already knew them they would undergo peculiar activities without explanation or even a clue at what they meant this is simply one of those movies that says its about one thing and it something totally different,negative
I had never seen such an incredible acting job in a motion picture as I did when I saw Daniel DayLewis play Christy Brown in My Left Foot In fact off the scene his role wasnt even over He played the role of Christy Brown or at least disabled like him all through the filming of the movie and needed surgery because of the damage his superior acting had done to his back To me that is remarkable and through all the pain he put up with to act that role I believe it is quite true to say he put on the most Oscar worthy performance in history He was so masterful in this tough a part that I believe no one could have done it better or with more of an impact than him Although I cannot say it is the greatest movie of all time I can say that how he played this impossible a role and then kept on acting it until it wasnt even acting anymore is without a doubt the greatest feet I will ever seen an actor do Probably a man too for that matter,positive
I had just finished reading the book and was really looking forward to seeing this TV adaptation which was broadcast on the Hallmark Channel on Monday night 53005 The key to the whole book was the manifesto which was stolen by the man with steel teeth but I watched for an hour out of 3 12 and I saw the man with the steel teeth but I never saw him steal a manifesto I saw someone steal some virus but what did that have to do with the book Its too bad because this film had great production values and a good cast but isnt the idea of turning a book into a movie TV or film to get the people who read the book to be part of the audience They only kept me for an hour I thought the premise of the book was great and what did they do but throw out the whole premise This book had a great McGuffin to paraphrase Hitchcock but they ignored it And it said in the titles that Forsyth was involved in the production They sure must have paid him a LOT of money,negative

A beautifully constructed and brilliantly acted comedy There is not a person in the cast who does not acquit himself or herself with hilarious distinction However the real star of the film is the unseen director Frank Oz who brings all the madcap sensibility and wit to this farce that he brought to Miss Piggys encounters with Kermit the frog This is a not tobemissed film,positive
I am a fan of Jess Francos bizarre style and a lover even of his trashier films and my personal opinion is that he has besides several very entertaining movies also created a few masterpieces such as the brilliant Paroxismus aka Venus In Furs of 1969 for example It is however an undeniable fact that the 180 movies this highly prolific filmmaker has directed in his career also include a bunch of big time stinkers Sadomania of 1981 certainly is one of these stinkers just an utterly bad and plot less movie with the ability to bore the hell out of you in spite of constant sleaze and nuditybr br Sure the constant nudity will keep you entertained for 20 minutes but since it keeps going on and on like that one is pretty likely to get bored after a short time The only thing that really kept me watching this was the intensity of the sleaze which is generously spoken slightly amusingbr br After couple of newlyweds get lost in the desert on some island they are stopped by a bunch of topless women carrying guns wardens of a local prison camp While the husband is banished from the island the wife is taken to the prison camp a place of torture and sexual humiliation reigned by the sadistic nymphomaniac Magda and an extremely perverted governor The prisoners are of course entirely hot chicks most of them blondes the wardens are entirely topless women carrying riflesbr br The plot if one can call it that is extremely stupid of course but who is going to watch this for a good plot anyway The only interesting thing about Sadomania is the high level of exploitation even for a Women In Prison film There are probably two short scenes in the movie where we see a woman actually wearing a top the sleaze contains all kinds of sexual perversions from rape to bestiality and some of the torture scenes are really nastybr br It is amazing that a film with this extreme level of sleaze however can still be so boring The sleaze will keep you watching in the beginning but after the first 45 minutes I actually had a hard time not to fall asleep It also makes me wonder why out of all pornstars Jess Franco chose Ajita Wilson who was according to most sources a transsexual who had been born a man well maybe for exactly that reason If you really want to watch this make sure you have enough beer at home to sit through it and watch it for the sleaze and exploitation only and maybe for the slight unintentional fun factor Dont expect to be highly entertained however it is almost unbelievable how a movie with such a high sleaze level can be so boring I am a Jess Franco fan and I always will be but Sadomania is just bad 210,negative

This film is a great example of fine storytelling The acting is superb The story is inspiring without being overly manipulative or fake There were a couple points where they probably made people a tad more good or bad than they really were but considering it is a Hollywood movie they showed amazing restraint There wasnt a single explosion shown in the movie even though they had one opportunity to The film while having suspenseful parts was not made into an action movie The story is thus made to focus on an extraordinary man in unfortunately ordinary times Well done,positive
Given that Roger Corman attached his name to this production I had high hopes for this film Corman directed many memorable low budget horror flicks in the 1960s I particularly enjoyed his adaptations of Poes stories such as The House Of Usher and The Pit And Pendulum and The Raven which starred the late great Vincent Price These films had solid acting atmosphere suspense strong characterization intriguing plot development and delivered some chilling moments Sadly House Of The Damned for the most part sacrifices these qualities in lieu of cheesy low budget special effects gratuitous nudity and mindless gore topped with cliche fast edits and camera anglesbr br House Of The Damned starts off interestingly with some beautiful location shots in Ireland but its straight downhill from here Unfortunately instead of spending some time building atmosphere creating characters we might care about or building suspense  the director opts to begin running up the body count After a brief introduction to the lead characters a young couple and their daughter the audience spends the balance of the film being bounced from one spooky event to another which in this film substitutes for coherent plot development The lead characters are so ill conceived and are so badly acted  the audience doesnt care what happens to them To make matters worse the spooky events are either utterly cliché or unconvincing due to low tech  low budget special effects The soundtrack has been lifted from The Omen The plot what little there is borrows heavily from Poltergeist and The Legend Of Hell House but lacks any of the qualities which made these films convincingbr br If you interested in seeing well done haunted house flicks I recommend you check out classics like The Haunting 1963 The Innocents 1961 or look into Cormans early American International films and pass on House Of The Damned unless youre masochistic or mindlessbr br 3 ½ out of 10br br Rob Rheubottombr br Wpg MB Canada,negative

In the year 2006 In Cold Blooda riveting thriller from 1967has two new interesting contexts that it did not previous have First and most chillingly is the fact that its star Robert Blake was recently on trial for murdering his wife Second the recent Oscar winning biopic Capote showed the muddled back story of this haunting true crime tales author Truman Capote These two new twists make the film timely for a modern audiencebr br As a stand alone film from its era In Cold Blood is top notch in every way Most notable is the stunning black and white cinematography from Conrad Hall later of American Beauty and Road to Perdition fame Many of the stills from this film of the Kansas farm house at night or the treelined back country roads could be sold as fine art photography Combined with the crackerjack direction from Brooks and superb editing in the early scenes where we see the mundane daily life of the innocent family about to be senselessly slaughtered beautifully intertwined with the plotting of the two hapless killers a rich brooding atmosphere is created that sets the stage for riveting suspense even when everyone knows how this is all going to end due to the fact its all based on real life events Its also great to see in this day and age how brilliantly staged a harrowing murder scene can be depicted where the graphic nature of the act is transmitted to the viewer subliminally with nary a drop of blood shown on screenbr br The film is also anchored nicely by Robert Blakes eerie performance as the more sympathetic yet senselessly brutal side of the killing duo The flashback scenes to his horrible childhood are extremely well done Then there is the scene towards the end of the film where he is speaking to the reverend before being sent to the gallows and he makes his last confession so to speak Its one of those classic movie moments that is a perfect marriage of gritty acting superb writing flawless direction and haunting photography I dare you to erase from your mind the stark image of the rains reflection from the window flowing down Robert Blakes pallid face in lieu of actual tearsbr br The only thing hampering In Cold Blood is the slow moving middle act where the killers are on the lam and the forced nature of the social commentary at the end The tackedon political message about the death penalty is secondary to its compelling depiction of the mad killers and their prey,positive
Takashi Miikes incursion into kiddie territory won me over almost immediately because he demonstrates nerve and bravery in dealing with fantasy elements This is a fairy tale that dares to be dark Even as a kid I thought that there was something sinister about most fairy tales horrible things happen to people in most childrens books Miike understands that these classic tales are a bit scarier and more disturbing than what they appear to be at first glance The filmmaker takes the archetypical story of a kid on a wondrous quest out of the preschool classroom He accentuates the very real fears of a world filled with neverending hazardous missions Westerners like to downplay the seriousness behind bedtime stories written specifically for kids I appreciated the fact that Miike was more honest than most American filmmakers He goes for the jugular of the story but he also shows signs of restrain But a selfpossessed Miike is still stranger than most filmmakers I thought it was a great film Highly recommended,positive
After hitting the viewers with three very different episodes right off the bat Serling continued to go about introducing viewers to The Twilight Zone in a very strange way by scheduling one the series biggest growers as the fourth episode The SixteenMillimeter Shrine is one of the more understated episodes focusing on an aging movie stars inability to cope with the changing times and only introducing a supernatural element in the closing minutes Because of this approach the episode is under whelming at first but subsequent viewings reveal it to be a thoroughly classy and beautifully written short storybr br Both the leads Ida Lupino as Barbara Jean Trent and Martin Balsam as her frustrated but caring agent shine in their performances The main problem with the episode is that the supposedly 25 year old footage of the actress is unconvincing Lupino looks identical when playing the young Trent as she does when playing the middle aged Trent and this diminishes the tragedy of the situation significantly Fortunately Lupino acts her socks off in convincing us of her desperation to return to the past Its a situation most can sympathise with and yet Trent is far from a sympathetic character She is a primadonna who gives little thought to the feelings of those around her such as the disastrously withered costar who she tactlessly belittles because he reminds her of just how long ago her glory days were It is somewhat surprising then that she is rewarded with a happy ending It is clear what is going to happen from the moment we see the huge projection screen and it is cleverly preempted in the opening moments when Trent scares her maid by stepping out from behind the screen What is not clear at the beginning however is whether being sucked into the projector will prove a reward or a harsh lesson in appreciating what we have and living in the moment As it turns out Trent is allowed to return to the past she longed for a testament to how strong the wishful thinking of humans can bebr br The SixteenMillimeter Shrine gets better with each viewing The top notch writing and acting combine to create a short play of enormous power which reflects the nature of humans to long for the past even though we can never return Except in the Twilight Zone,positive

This movie truly shows the farce and hypocrisy of Indian society What it tries to show you is only ONE side of the story The other side of the story is the hidden emotional and mental abuse of Indian children which this movie does not showbr br Indian Parents are culpable for the following a Destroying the individuality of the children by making them completely dependent on the parents at a very early age Such children grow up to be Adults only in physical looks but remain children in minds Since everything has been provided to them by their great Indian parents They children automatically do not feel the need to work hard at something or learn the basics of human communication with other human beings apart from their parentsbr br B I can show you so many Indian parents who try to prevent their kids making friends going out or prevent them to do anything which starts making them to grow into adultsbr br The reason why they do is the same selfishness Indian parents expect their children to take care of them when they grow old They do no savings for themselves and once they reach the age of 50They cry out LOUDWe have grown old now and so we are dependent on you children since we have done the GREAT SERVICE of bringing you to this world and taking care of you and making you intellectually weakbr br Most of the Indian parents at the age of 50 have dilapidated bodies and health and are financially completely insecure Most feel that they ABSOLUTELY have no need to take care of themselves since they expect their kids to take care of thembr br In the west the opposite of that happens People start planning at the age of 20 about their retirement and once they retire they are financially securebr br Indian parents do NOTHING of that sort since like I said they have brought the kids in the world and what better investment at thatbr br I am a victim of my Indian parents i am sure there are countless other Indian kids like me who have grown up physically but are still struggling with their lives on THEIR OWN and they continue to have pestering 50 year olds who cry out loud for HELP all the timebr br This movie shows only ONE side of the storyUTTER piece of JUNK,negative
If youre looking for a movie that puts you to sleep then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you The book wasnt what I expected to it to be and the movie disappointed me even further The cast list was pitiful and the all around plot was pathetic and was not like the book except for a few scenes I understand that everyone has their own point of view as they read Heart of Darkness and they create their own movie in their head but they director cuts important scenes and adds pointless ones If there was someone in the movie who was supposed to be of a certain culture they shouldve used an actor that was of that culture There are actors from every where and Im sure that they couldve found better ones to fit the roles Joseph Conrad was a respectable man and created a book that will entertain you if thats what youre looking for but the movie was cheap and pointless and someone who could make the movie as respectable as the book shouldve done it If you want a movie that drags you into darkness then Heart of Darkness is the movie for you,negative
Roy Thinnes and Joan Hackett are superb in this 1970 melodrama The lush settings the haunting music and plot twists make it a truly interesting film I had seen it when it first came out on TV Once more it aired when I had a VCR but I did not have a chance to tape it Would love it on VHS if someone has a copy Apart from the suspense which is worked in beautifully I feel the story is unique and is pretty much true to the book MRS MAITLANDS AFFAIR by Margaret Lynn I would say that it was one of the greatly overlooked best films of the 1970s out of movies made for TV I have given the film a number 10 rating because it is done with so much originality There is a true pathos and air of romance which has the viewer sympathizing with the culprit,positive

From a modern sensibility its sometimes hard to watch older films Its annoying to have to watch the stereotypical wallflower librarian have to take off her glasses and become pretty and stupid to win a man Especially such a shallow and inconstant man Hes obviously a player I wouldnt trust him to stay true to her who doesnt want to settle down who only looks at dumb attractive women and always calls them baby ick Even after she totally changes her appearance and her life for him he only goes to her after hes supposedly rejected by another woman and learns that Connie spent all her money renovating a boat for him I wanted her to stand up to him not pathetically chase after him His sudden conversion within a few minutes was totally unrealistic and did not work for mebr br Apart from that subplot I did like the movie How can you not like sailors dancing with each other You can tell they were from San Francisco D The rehearsal dance was great watching Ginger Rogers purposefully fall in and out of the correct steps was great The last dance scene Face the Music with the beautiful costumes and the art deco set was beautiful And I really enjoyed We Saw the Sea though they did use it a few too many times as if they realized it was their best song br br Anyway the plot was a bit weak like most musicals IMO  and the songs were OK but the dancing was worth watching the film for I wish they could have showed some shots of San Francisco since that was were the film was supposedly setbr br Its also weird to see such a lighthearted naval film with the knowledge of what Hitler was already doing at that time I have to try to suspend all knowledge to submerge myself into a made up fantasy land,positive
Okay lets face it this is a godawful movie The plot such as it is is horrible the acting worse But the movie was made for one reason and one reason only like all of those awful Mario Lanza moviesjust to hear the voice of the star in this case Pavarotti in his prime Okay so maybe the Lanza movies were also an excuse for him to hit on women but this movie is about hearing Luciano That alone is worth watching the movie A big opera star stuck on himself faces his fears finds humility and love along the way and belts out a lot of hit numbers toobr br I must admit Im prejudiced on a number of levels Im Italian Im a big Pavarotti fan is there anything about Pavarotti that isnt big including his fan base And when I first saw this movie I was going out on my own seeing the height and depth of Lifes possibilities and in love for the first time So as awful as this movie is the beautiful voice and memories are enough to make me breathe deep of life and love againbr br Yes its corny and awful But the voice is immortal and timeless and the voice is what its all about So I give this movie a high rating in hopes that someone who has never heard Pavarotti before will listen and watch and enjoy a new level of music and love especially since he is now gone Like Italian food that youve never tried before try it You may be pleasantly surprised as a Luciano lover or prospective Pavarotti peep,positive

It would help to know why it took so long for a book as movieready as The House Next Door to be adapted for film or television The book was copyrighted in 1978 One reason could be problems designing the house The house in this Lifetime film is really so ugly that I cant imagine anyone buying it In fact its so ugly that someone would probably have come and destroyed it as soon as it was builtbr br Im not crazy about horror genre books but this one was hard to put down when I came across it around ten years ago The main characters are not the kind of people to look for anything occult in life and this is one of the books strengths They are not people who would conclude that the architect was some type of demonor the devil personified without witnessing and analyzing the events described so well in the book However it is a downbeat book for the most part and I dont think that appeals to the people who run Lifetime Maybe someone will come up with another version of the book in years to come A better housebetter musica better screenplay and darker lightingwould certainly help,negative
I couldnt I was bored not just because the acting was terrible and the tragic story was simply a bmovie whose plot was all about the cannibalism but the fact I was watching a subtitle foreign film which doesnt bother me at all but was STILL dubbedbr br The special effects were awful As the back of the plane splits off you can see the model is hollow as it breaks away in the phony snow Most of the movie takes place on a sound stage that clearly is not real and almost looks like a play as the sounds of snow blowing all over are heard but not actually scenebr br But how what will they eat They have no food one military person Its never clear what this guy does or why hes in charge says which Im sure no one ever said in reality or even thought about food since they were concerned if the people were alive not how theyd eat It was simply a stupid line written to point out that yes they will have to eat the dead bodies to survivebr br When they finally decide to eat the bodies one man finds one shirtless body who despite being in the snow for however long is not remotely frozen in fact his flesh is very flexible and fresh He cuts the fresh meat off his back that again is not frozen or even cold it appears and this scene goes on for five minutes Thats where I had to stop The remake Alive was a far superior film about trying to survive in a horrible situation that Im sure the real survivors praised whereas I cant imagine any of them had anything nice to say about this version It was simply about eating dead bodies and everything else was secondary Avoid,negative
Writing about something so wonderful is completely hard Actually its almost impossible to describe the peculiarities of this movie This is a marvelous story about sex and gender and its almost unbelievable that we have not to deal with obscene scenes of sex Feeling this film was made for people that like to feel and just to feel life in all its complexity in a gorgeous simple way We look at it and something starts growing inside our minds even our hearts it a pure poem Ive watched some gay movies and I almost always got really unsatisfied with unnecessary scenes of sex not because I dont like scenes of sex but generally they are so pornographic that Im forced to think that the director or the producers or the writer of the script thinks that homosexuality means perversion Nagisa no Shindobaddo is totally different from that ones Three are the main characters We have Ito Yoshida and Aihara two boys and a girl in a peculiar love triangle Ito likes his best friend Yoshida Yoshida likes Aihara and Aihara likes Ito Imagine what this could turn in unprepared hands But in the contrary Hashiguchi makes a magnificent story which goes profoundly in the philosophy of life adding a question in our mind that made me think astonished in the end of the movie Why And that why expanded in multiple questions inside of my brain and inside of my heart The scenes actually sometimes tending to be boring are moments of the most delightful poem which we are able to feel but totally unable to write down in words And maybe because of that we are unable to understand the question in the end of the movie Im sure this movie was not made for us to discuss every piece of it Some people want to understand a film almost dissecting it Others are so used to common American gay movies that cant appreciate the real value of this masterpiece Watch it close your eyes in the credits and feel everything feel yourself feel the wonderful song For all this and much much more I give a nine And I just dont give ten because ten of ten is perfection But I confess I almost did it,positive
This film is terrible Not only is the story unbelievable the situations the characters put themselves in are so silly to the point where it isnt shocking I find it sad that Daisy Eagan star of Broadways The Secret Garden decided that this would be a career step The idea is interesting two young girls coming of age very quickly But the sex isnt even arousing The film is silly the story is silly the performances are silly and the whole concept while interesting falls flat Im sure all 14 year old girls make out with guys after theyve had their first period and tried to flush their panties down the toilet Better Luck next time guys My Scale  TScale ,negative
I just watched this film and I have to say it surprised me It was very well done with good acting and a deep look at high school students from Japan in adolescent lovebr br The look and feel is a lot different from many movies and you can easily get into the film Much of the emphasis seems to be in the story itself which is extremely subtle The main theme and relations with other characters are a bit complex But the the overall sense of realism and dimensions still pulls you inbr br A main draw back is of course those who like something simple Which is not here You have to be open to many things including a new culture to get more into the filmbr br I did enjoy this film though It is worth watching,positive

Henry Fool is a better film But this is the perfect way to followup a film like Henry Fool To take Henry very seriously his lies and his mysterious aura Even the opening shot of Henry Fool when Simon puts his ear to the ground as Henry comes walking over the hill is more fully manifest through Fay Grim The overthetop jokes that are more or less metajokes about the writing of the film and the jokes themselves are good but the opening of the film is a little saturated in them Also Hartleys use of Dutch angles throughout the film is jarring yes its intention but it feels forced and overused it goes beyond jarring to what Id like to call annoying Its a flawed film but a must see for any Hartley or Henry Fool fan br br And dont listen to stupid reviews dont watch this unless youve seen the first film The intrigue satire and wit of this movie is totally lost if you havent seen Henry Fool Its a sequel Thats just dumb,positive

Charlie Wilsons War based on a true story tells the tale of a Texas congressman and a CIA agent working to secure funding for covert support of the Mujaheddin in 1980s Afghanistan following the USSR invasion of the country This conflict played a major role in the final years of the Cold War between the US and the USSRbr br In terms of film making Charlie Wilsons War is a definite winner It wellwritten wellacted and wellshot While most of the attention has gone to Tom Hanks for yet another fine performance I was even more impressed with Philip Seymour Hoffmans turn as CIA operative Gust Avrakotos Scenes of Soviet attacks on underarmed villages and of the refugee camp effectively tug at the heart The film also gives a good behindthescenes look at the wheeling and dealing that Congressman Wilson must go through to secure the desired fundingbr br There are however two complaints I have about the film The first is that there is a subplot involving an scandal investigation that is not welldeveloped and as such only serves as a minor distraction to the story line The second complaint is that the film lacks some of the context of the war The film makes the Mujaheddin look like innocent victims and while they did suffer large civilian casualties the Mujaheddin were in fact rebels trying to topple the government of Afghanistan This government ignored entirely in the film not surprisingly fought to suppress the rebellion later calling on the Soviet Union for support in their effort The film also ignores that the US was aiding the Mujaheddin prior to the Soviet deployment in Afghanistan The film did hint at the unintended consequences of our covert actions  consequences we are still feeling today  but it seems as if screenwriter Aaron Sorkin and director Mike Nichols were willing to sacrifice some historical context to provide a cohesive narrative Not having read the book I do not know if George Crile made the same compromise Those complaints notwithstanding I did enjoy watching Charlie Wilsons War and do recommend it I would have preferred a film that more accurately depicted the complexities of the situation as Stephen Gaghan did in Syriana but the audiences connected better with cohesive narrative of Charlie Wilsons War than with the ambiguities present in Syriana,positive
Heart of Darkness was terrible The novel was difficult enough to understand but when a production company decides to release a film loosely based on it then that just messes everyone up Not only did those in charge decide to change certain characters and completely eliminate others but the acting was horrid and the overall impression I got from the movie was that it was a complete dud I watched the film in hopes of understanding the novel a bit better but it just threw me and my fellow classmates off completely I think the movie was a waste of time and I was disappointed to see Tim Roth in such a disappointing film especially when he has awesome flicks like Pulp Fiction and Resivior Dogs under his belt Same with the very cool John Malkovich,negative

Not the best of the films to be watched nowadays I read a lot of reviews about Shining and was expecting it to be very good But this movie disappointed me The sound and environment was good but there was no story here Not was there a single moment of fright I expected it to a horror thriller movie but there was no horror no thriller The only scene where I got scared was during the chapter change scene showing Wednesday There are lots of fragments i the movie Most of the things are left unexplained with nothing to link it to anything The story does not tell us about the women or other scenes that is shown Might be a good movie to watch in the 80s but not for the 21st century,negative

This Is Not A Love Song is a brilliant example of the chase genre which many people think has an underlying meaning The love between the two main characters may be more than fraternal I believe that Heaton is in love with Spike but Spike is too naive to see thisbr br I really feel this is portrayed with such scenes as the blow back and letter writing sequences Heaton shows great intimacy towards Spike With intense facial expressions and how he takes great care in writing Spikes name on the top of his lettersbr br One thing Ive noticed when looking at external reviews is that when the film has been slated the reviewer seems to have not fully understood the film as they havent even mentioned the possibility of Heaton having sexual feelings for Spike I also get the feeling that some of the reviewers havent recognised it when they use phrases like Who is Heaton Whats he doing with a retard like Spike This person however may have hit the nail on the head with their remark Spike shows noticeable signs of having ADD although I dont think this person has realised this as he seems to be using the word retard as a derogatory termbr br I really enjoyed this film Although it is not for the faint hearted The film is exceedingly character based after the shooting until the end there isnt much but dialogue between the two antiheroes Unless you are used to watching such deep gritty films stay well away,positive

I just finished watching Going Overboard I have to say that we should send every copy of this film to Iraq and make them watch I even tried to get a blind women to watch this and she turned it off in like 20 min Adam Sandler could not find a better project than this As for the writing if thats what you want to call it those responsible should be forced to watch this movie forever in Hell I believe that somewhere I read that the budget for this film was 10000 and they were way under Did Wallmart get a good deal on this Every store has a big huge bin of this crap sitting on the sales floor The only good thing about this movie is you can use the DVD as a coaster or trade it to a friend but then they might not be your friend anymore,negative
Cary Grant and Myrna Loy are perfectly cast as a middle class couple who want to build the house of their dreams It all starts out with reasonable plans and expectations both of which are blown to bits by countless complications and an explosion of the original budgetbr br There are many great laughs even if the story is somewhat thin sure to entertain fans of the stars or the late 1940s Hollywood comedy style A definite highlight comes when a contractor goes through a run down of all expenses which must have sounded quite excessive to a 1948 audience As he makes his exit he assures the client Grant that perhaps he could achieve a reduction of 10000 from the totalor at least 5000but certainly 2500 Hilarious,positive

This movie should have ended as soon as the joke about Bebes Kids is told in the opening I liked Robin Harris and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see Liken it to taking the point of one of Jerry Seinfelds jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie This movie had to be selfserving because I can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar Whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value 110 stars because there is no half star,negative
The actors  actresses on this series are OK but the scripts have been absolutely horrible This family is so dysfunctional that they are not even funny In fact the scripts illustrate very often how not to be a parent The scripts are so bad they make Homer Simpson look like a better father than this onebr br Anyone who is becoming a parent if you want to see what not to do with your kids this show is the perfect guide I think the garbage this show feeds us is beyond words br br Michael Rapaport has seen much better material in his career including his role in HITCH They need a strong lead in  better much better scripts than what I have seen to this pointbr br If you think this is generational my teenager even turned off one show of this because they thought it was horrible,negative

One of the unsung gems of the 1980s Scenes features razorsharp satire and outstanding performances from Arnetia Walker how did she not get a ton of roles after thisand Wallace Shawn Its a delicious sendup of class warfare and the people in those classes The writing is hilarious and the characters while not subtle are nuanced And sorry but the Asian gangs if you can call one Japanese guy extorting one of the other characters a gang were not put in for sociological value as another review implies they should been The value here lies in what the movie is making fun of and in the sparklingly wicked way it does it I found it creative funny and idiosyncratic,positive
This film IS brilliant without a doubt Watched it a while ago after constant pestering from family members who are right into their scifi films which I am not and thought it was quite good But after recently watching a few documentaries on outerspace etc we watched it again and it IS goodbr br Kevin Spacey is without doubt one of the greatest actors ever and I really like Jeff Bridges Big Lewbowski Blown Away Arlington Road The film revolves around a patient in a nursing home who claims he is from another planet Yeah right you think but what if his story is so believable that even his psychiatrist begins to wonder if he is telling the truthbr br That is how the story evolves with Bridges going through all kinds of emotions dealing with Prot as he is known his own psychiatric colleagues his wife and family his brotherinlaw and his cosmologist astronomer work colleagues who after getting some data from Prot pretty much admit that he might be telling the truth A great film that gets you wonderingbr br 810 Dave,positive
This is one of the best Fred AstaireGinger Rogers films or at least one of my favorites Most of the AR movies feature great dancing but sappy romance stories This still has the courtship corniness but not as pronounced as the other filmsbr br This movie features not just great dancing but likable characters and a bunch of good songs The music is the central theme here and whats nice is the addition of a tap solo by Rogers She not only was a super dancer but a very pretty woman and one with tremendous figure She dances also with Fred of course and theyre always a fun pair to watch on the dance floorbr br Growing up in the 1950s watching Ozzie  Harriet on television it was a real kick the first time I saw this to see such a young Harriet Hilliard No surprise than Ozzie fell for this beauty Although she had that short early 30s hairstyle I recognized her voice right away Also in this movie are quick appearances by Betty Grable and Lucille Ball but I have to admit that I have yet to out Ball I cant find her but I know shes in herebr br Astaire except for some obnoxious gumchewing in the first third of the film was fun to watch and Randolph Scott  although better in westerns  is likable toobr br This is simply a nice feelgood film and good one if you want to to enjoy the great talents of Astaire and Rogers,positive
Jude law gives Keanu Reeves a run for his money as the most wooden actor around Renee Zs character is straight out of the Beverly Hillbillies and the two leads have about as much chemistry as Darth Vader and Queen Amedala The bad guys are the worst kind of cliche and theres not a subtle moment in the film Incredible that some critics actually liked this movie,negative
When I saw that this film was being aired on late night TV I initially decided to give it a miss I am glad that I then started watching Yes the special effects are the same as Gerry Andersens puppet shows Some of the actorsactresses are from his other productions he obviously used the same composer later on as the cheesy soundtrack could only have come from one of his productions and the plot is as slow as a wet weekend Get by all that and you have a film that shows up intriguing possibilities Is there a planet on the far side of the sun Is it a duplicate earth Is everything about it reversed and if so do they speak English in reverse I love this dated SF if only for Gerrys wonderful model cars planes buildings and spaceships Some of them are not so far fetched as they seemed back then And did you see the European Space Centre logo Very reminiscent of the Euro logo of today Suspend belief and spend a couple of hours watching this you will be glad you did,positive
Ive watched hundreds of kung fu movies and Ive heard some good thing about this movie so I decided to give it a try What I saw was one of the worst displays of movie making Ive ever seenbr br I cant help but feel like the director want to have every muscle guy in Hong Kong in this movie Everyone overacts to the point of stupidity Even Conan the Barbarian had some civility This movie just has halfevolved men screaming in every scene and stupid women who has no selfrespect The narrators character shouldve be killed for sucking so muchshe really didnt deserve to live til the end The entire movie was a melodramatic mess with horrible acting bad directing and bad action They shouldve just rename this movie to The Stupid OneArmed Caveman with a Blade Heres a questionwhy do some director use quick cuts for some action movies Answer To can hide the deficiencies of the actors Nearly every scene was close up and quickly cut without any kind of flow The movie tried so hard to show intensity but it became almost laughable Please stay away from this movie it you have any kind of taste in kungfu moviesor any taste in movies,negative
Meanspirited ugly nasty retroaction thriller about a bodyguard who is determined to find and destroy the killers of the girl he was supposed to protect This film is almost an anachronism in todays politically correct atmosphere Director Scott doesnt have any desire to apologize for the inherently immorality behind the films dramatic structure Scott is either not aware or doesnt care for 30 years of social advances I really dont think we will see a more violent film any time soon so you better go and see this one while you can Despite its relentless grimness I think the movie is a powerful example of cinema at its most sinister exploitative and effective Scott has a tough thing to sell but I think Im a buyer The extraordinary technical aspects of this film are just too effective for me to ignore Scotts directorial choices are simply astonishing and he pulls a great performance out of Denzel Washington Sensitive souls need to stay away from this one but I recommended it to those viewers looking for a great actionfilled movie,positive
Wow another Kevin Costner hero movie Postman Tin Cup Waterworld Bodyguard Wyatt Earp Robin Hood even that baseball movie Seems like he makes movies specifically to be the center of attention The characters are almost always the same  the heroics the flaws the greatness the fall the redemption Yup within the 1st 5 minutes of the movie were all supposed to be in awe of his character and it builds up more and more from therebr br And this time the story  story  is just a collage of different movies You dont need a spoiler youve seen this movie several times though it had different titles Youll know what will happen way before it happens This is like mixing An Officer and a Gentleman with Backdraft but both are easily better movies Watch Backdraft to see how this kind of movie should be made  and also to see how an good but slightly underrated actor Russell plays the hero,negative

I was looking in the TV Guide for movies that come from Germany and I found one called The Bunnyguards so I watched it and I laughed myself silly I wanted the DVD but its not available here I could order it from Germany but it doesnt have subtitles It was played again so I taped it and watch it from time to timebr br Anyway I looked for info on it and found out its real name is Erkan  Stefan but I know it by its Australian title The Bunnyguardsbr br Some people who I know from Germany do not like Erkan  Stefan because of their accents but not being German myself I didnt notice anything The jokes are good but some Germans might find their accents offputtingbr br I think this movie is funny and if the DVD had English subtitles on all the extras having a 2 disk edition with only the feature having subtitles would be bad I would buy it up in a snapbr br I recommend it to anyone looking for a laugh and a pretty good story,positive
Im starting to wonder after reading some of the opinions here if I watched the same film as the other reviewers but after checking my facts I am forced to the sad conclusion that I havebr br This witless wannabee screwball comedy has to be one of the the longest 94 minutes I have spent and one of the most unfunny things I have seen for ages Now dont get me wrong I love screwball comedies but this boring setbound drivel falls so far short of the dizzy heights of Preston Sturges and Howards Hawks that it doesnt deserve to mix my metaphors to be thought of in the same breath as those greats Writer  Director Charles Martins dialogue is neither witty subtle or interesting  and theres so much of it He doesnt know how to end a scene either with some ruthless cutting especially of people exiting rooms and saying goodbye to each other the pace of film would have been lifted and then the fact that the limited number of characters are doing stupid and motiveless things for no other reason than this is supposed to be a comedy would have been a little less obvious Characters in this movie fall in and out of love with each other and move in and out of apartments at a moments notice only to move what little plot there is forward One moment people are desperately yearning for one person the next they are getting married to someone else  having wooed and been wooed off screen so we know nothing about it until one of the characters tells us  Oh theyre getting married usually after someone has made a fauxpas or jumped to the wrong conclusion If we had known that these two characters were in love or supposed to be engaged before hand we the audience might have enjoyed the experience of watching someone making a fool of themselves in front of them As it is the characters just come over looking like selfish petulant idiots and we have no sympathy for any of thembr br The sets are limited and the action confined to them in a way that makes the whole thing look like a badly filmed stage play The only moments of relief from the tedium are Keenan Wynn who looks like he has wandered in from a different movie and has decided to hang around and be slightly funnier than all the unfunny stuff going on around himbr br Highly avoidable,negative
The Hills Eyes II one of the most pointless and blatantly stupid sequels to come around in some time is 90 minutes of incompetent film making at its finest Or worst however you choose to look at it While 2006s Hills remake was one of the years best and truly frightening horror films this sequel takes every spark out of what made that such an accomplishment Part 2 never gets off the ground and neither does its mind numbing dialogue Worst of all its not that scarybr br 2006s remake followed a family who find themselves in the middle of the New Mexico desert deserted and one by one being picked off by deranged and sadistic hill people People who as a result of the military testing the atomic bomb on their land years ago have become who they are Surviving off travelers who wander into the region The sequel puts audiences in the same desert now occupied by the military as they covertly investigate the hills and what might have happened to that poor family When a group of military trainees are brought to the campsite they find it deserted with no signs of life A grim reality soon befalls them as they come to the realization that theyre not alone And the bloody fate that was handed to many before them will soon become their destinybr br It doesnt take a genius to realize that Hills has no legitimate reason to exist But because last years remake was received well both at the box office and by critics it came to no surprise that a sequel would be rushed into production while theres still money to be earned Theres no rhyme or reason to it this time around just an unbelievable and ridiculous setup to pave the way for thoughtless characters unoriginal killings a nonexistent story and slipping interest Originally director Alexander Aja made Cravens cult classic into a remake that was a unique and thoroughly disturbing experience One that gruesomely crossed the line on more than one occasions Its frank display of violence sadistic torture wellrounded characterization and whiteknuckled suspense were all effectively used to shock and repulse audiences The second time around its rehashed handmedowns Theres no style no grit It tries to build up tension by dismembering bodies when all it really does is make for a been there done that kind film where even the gore seems tame compared to more recent bloodbathsbr br Its a sad state of affairs when deformed mutants who capture women for breeding purposes fails to keep your attention Its a bore nothing more Hills has no bite Despite a jump or two here and there theres nothing very scary about this bythenumbers horror flick It feels like something youd see on the SciFi channel only with some Fbombs a blood splatter here and there a rape and a graphic birth scene thats more gross than shocking Its cheap And with Hills you reap what you sew With no effort given you cant expect anything in returnbr br Replacing Aja with Martin Weisz as director was the films first big mistake all he does is drain the film of any sort of emotional resonance But even more shocking is the uncharacteristically bad script penned by Wes Craven and his son Jonathan Craven You ask how bad could it possibly be This is the kind of dialogue that makes any comparison look like Shakespeare Craven has had his fair share of clunkers in the past but Id never expect something like this from him Its so unintentionally funny you have to wonder is Craven playing a joke on this Or did he dump this one on his son after the studio payed him off The films characters are onedimensional talking heads with no emotions or common sense The acting is just as bad The only character who may win you over is Napoleon Napoli the scrawny kid who doesnt fit in with the others Even the deranged and instinctdriven villains who we might have found some favor with in the deepest of our thoughts a year ago are met with indifferent You dont hate them you dont like them You honestly couldnt care less Just like this moviebr br Even if you were giddy with fear during The Hills Have Eyes as I was youll have a tough time finding anything to enjoy in this piece of garbage Its as generic as generic gets and theres absolutely nothing here we havent seen done many times already I cant express this enough avoid The Hills Have Eyes II like the plague Its frightless unoriginal frantic and a bore Stick to the remake or Cravens original vision Because if you dont walk out after the first thirty minutes dont say I didnt warn you,negative

I rented this shortly after renting Ben Steins Expelled and thought it would interesting to compare them Before I go further it seems only fair that I point out the following so a reader can see if Im prejudiced or not Im trying to be objective for the recordbr br I tend to enjoy Mahers HBO show now and then though I rarely think hes the source of the humor I dont really care for his standup either But he makes some good points on the show now and again and I liked Politically Incorrect though he was still fairly politically correct which I deem a negative because the very term sounds Orwellian or at least fascist As for my religious views Ill say for simplicitys sake that Im a nondenom Christian with some views that are objectivist and some that are agnostic mixed inbr br That being said this a bad documentary for reasons that havent been touched on yet by many reviewersthough the ones mentioned are valid too The reason its not convincing isnt just that he argues the main point without letting others talk and his point boils down to nothing logical either its just come on really which isnt a point just a question Try David Hume if you want a decent argument The reason this isnt convincing lies in his lack of experts on the subject matter I saw this about 2 months ago and I only recall him talking to one person whose credentials as a professional were mentioned if he wasnt a clergyman There are probably hundreds of scientists or at least professors with Masters or Doctorates willing to do a bit of verbal sparring particularly in the fields of History Anthropology or a host of othersbr br If one compares this to Ben Steins Expelled No Intelligence Allowed hell find that Stein interviews about 30 credentialed professors professionals clergy etc He does this with a variety of sources with various backgrounds He also makes a point in his film regarding freedom of thought and education Maher could easily have pointed out wrongs committed by theocratic rules throughout centuries or persecutions from this Instead he idiotically refers to the 20th centurys secular totalitarian regimes as evidence of why secularism needs more sociopolitical power its in the bonus features where hes standing in front of the Anne Frank house I think This is a true Orwellian headtrip He blames Christianity in particular on many pointless deathswhich has had its share though far smaller than mostwithout even including a basic view of the evidence Perhaps this is because that argument is dwarfed by secular humanisms miserable record of the 20th Century ALONEbr br Another glaring weakness is his unwillingness to talk to anyone that would be considered a moderate or average practitioner He picks out the weakest gazelles of the herd How difficult is that How does proving the existence of exceptions move toward disproving the general rule It does not Wow so people in cults think outside of the norm How enlightening to know this Great work Maher Again it would be fairly easy to interview someone like Laurence Vance and include his work on refuting the idea of patriotic duty that demands a person fight in any war his country is involved inbr br Beyond all that hes just not that funny here Some of the clips that are overlaid in clever out of contextirreverent ways might garner a laugh but mostly work to illustrate how a real contextual argument from Maher will NOT be forthcoming much less convincing He spends most of his time bashing Christians spouting inaccuracies and interviewing fringe groups that he doesnt allow to really answer his questionsbr br For the record there are good questions to honestly ask of religious folks and many they should ask of themselves He touches on almost none of these I get the feeling that I couldve responded much better to most of his questioning than the people he interviewed but the whole thing reeks of deckstacking in terms of what is included and what was edited out,negative
20 out of 10 This is a truly wonderful story about a wartime evacuee and a curmudgeonly carpenter Tom Oakley The boy William Beech is billeted with Tom and it is immediately apparent that he has serious issues when he wets his bed on the first night William is illiterate and frightened but somehow the two find solace in each others loneliness It transpires that William has a talent as an artist and we see Toms talent as a choirmaster in an amusing rendition of Jerusalem William is befriended by Zacharias Wrench a young Jewish lad also from London and along with both Tom and Zacharias he finally learns to read and write and to feel a part of this small close knit community Just as he is settling down William is recalled back to London by his mother and it is here we see why he is so screwed up His mother is clearly mentally sick and when Tom doesnt hear from William he travels to London to look for him He finally finds him holding his dead baby sister where he has been tied up in a cellar After a period in hospital Tom realises he must kidnap him and take him home with him The climax is a bittersweet ending when William is told he is to be adopted by Tom while at the same time learning his best friend Zacharias has been killed in an air raid in London For me one of the most moving scenes was when Tom was talking to a official from the Home Officebr br I love im an for what its worth I think he loves me toobr br It just doesnt get better that that does it,positive

Quite frankly it seemed like seven hours of boredom as well What is it What is it about Will Smith that I just cant stand any longer I guess he just seems too hellbent on being taken seriously and obtaining an Oscar I understand how bias this is but unless he undergoes some new acting lessons I cant ever see him winning one Hes a huge name and is therefore generally confused with being a talented and diverse actor Hes just not I give him credit for trying so hard and being able to cry at the drop of a hat Thats about itbr br Seven pounds was kind of an eyeroller for me right from the start The suicide 911 call didnt intrigue me in any way I wasnt curious to know why he was calling in his own suicide There were absolutely no surprises The best I can say is that Will Smith and Rosario Dawson had some decent on screen chemistry Also I dont know her name but the hispanic woman did an excellent job with her role as a scared and beaten wife Woody Harrelson had very limited screen time but Id say he stole the show whenever he was onbr br All in all just an extremely run of the mill unoriginal plot I couldnt help asking myself the whole way through why I cared about any of these people Never once felt sorry for TimBen He killed himself with a jellyfish Was the only survivor in an 8 person accident Geewizdidnt see any of that comingbr br 510 is pretty generous,negative

Rita Hayworth plays a Brooklyn nightclub dancer named Rusty who specializes in cheesecake chorus revues she manages to get herself on the cover of a national fashion magazine but her impending success as a solo with romantic offers all around has smitten boss Gene Kelly chomping at the bit Terribly tired piece of Technicolor cotton candy with unmemorable musical sketches the two worst of which are irrelevant flashbacks to the 1890s with Hayworth portraying her own grandmother Kelly as always dances well but acts with false sincerity when hes serious hes insufferable and the rest of the time hes flying on adrenaline The script is a lead weight not even giving supporting players Phil Silvers and Eve Arden any good lines 12 from ,negative
Honestly at first I watched this movie because of the gratuitous sex scenes I heard it possesses but by actually watching the film it just made me realize that there are still good and sensible movies out there Truly it is one of the most wellcrafted and touching movies Ive ever watched Im a teenage bisexual and the film spoke to me about my predicaments  sex religion love acceptance etc It gave me an idea on how to deal with these issues with the help of my self and others around me who love me for who I am Cox really handled the movie well by sprinkling dozes of heartwarming lines and a bit of sexuality in it It made the movie more interesting Some people compare it to Brokeback Mountain but I dont agree myself Brokeback Mountain has more drama while Latter Days is wellbalanced,positive
The only redeeming quality of this film is that it shows bands and their music when it was changing in NY during 81 As for the film itself it has at least three major flaws First of all there is narration throughout the film which is not required at all In the few places where there is some explanation necessary just adding a little dialogue would have gone a long way Secondly there was no obvious attempt to synchronize any of the audio in fact it is quite apparent that most of the dialogue was recorded later with no attempt to match the film The third flaw was in the ending I will not give the ending away for those brave souls that would endure the torture of sitting through the film but it commits a cardinal sin in screenwriting Not worth the money or time it takes to see this unless you are a fan of one of the represented bands,negative
So tell me  what serious boozer drinks Budweiser How many suicidallyobsessed drinkers house a fully stocked and barely touched range of drinks in their lonely motel room that a millionaire playboys bachelorpad bar would be proud to boast And what kind of an alcoholic tends to drink with the bottle held about 8 inches from his hungry mouth so that the contents generally spill all over his face Not to mention wasting good whisky by dousing your girlfriends tits with it just so the cinema audience can get a good eyeful of Elisabeth Shues assetsbr br Cage seems to be portraying the most attentionseeking lookatme alcoholic ever to have graced the screen while Shue looks more like a Berkely preppy slumming it for a summer than some seasoned streetwalker She is humiliated and subjugated as often as possible in this revolting movie with beatings skin lacerations anal rape and graphic verbal abuse  all of it completely implausible and included apparently only to convey a sense of her horribly demeaned state and offer the male viewers an astonishingly clichéd sentimental sexual fantasy of the tartwithaheartbr br Still  I did watch it to the end by which time I was actually laughing out loud as Shues tough street hooker chopped carrots in the kitchen wanly pathetically smiling while Cage  all eyes popping and shaking like like a man operating a road drill in an earthquake  grimaced and mugged his way through the final halfhour,negative
I was a little worried about actors and acting in Italy then Le conseguenze dellamore and Toni Servillo came It was a long time that i didnt see a so charismatic actor on screen Paolo Sorrentino has written a wonderful story about loneliness and Tony has built one of the most unforgettable characters seen in movies in recent years The movie is not completely perfect but Titta Di Girolamo will stay with you for a long time after the vision of the movie Toni please keep on acting in movies youre for sure the coolest actor around today and not just in Italy his performance deserves international acclamation I rate this movie 910,positive

Ive seen better production quality on YouTube I pity the actors as the writing was terrible and the direction shocking not sure how they could get the lines out  I really doubt any actor would have been able to salvage this movie no matter how good they were The characters were not developed at all and there was no real cohesion in the plot which just seemed to go nowhere much Its a shame really as the premise for the movie was good and with better production quality direction and script it could have been a decent movie It certainly was not a comedy unless you laugh out loud at the dubbing  which was amateurish even the English actors sounded weird,negative
I wanted to like this movie but many elements ruined it for me The use of a fisheye lens throughout and choppy editing did not give me a sense of being in the world of the meth head but it did make me think I was watching MTV for a few short moments The movie never did seem to go anywhere and the acting was truly an excellent example of over acting I love movies that give us a glimpse into the seedy underworld but this film couldnt decide if it was a bad horror film or an even worse serious commentary on the horrors of addiction,negative
I find myself wondering what the people who gave this a 10 saw in it that I didnt This movie has a VERY hard time following andor staying to a plot If someone tells you its a comedy dont be fooled its about 98 percent odddrama and 2 comedy All actors turn in a great performance that cannot be denied however it seems like it really lost something somewhere Dont know if the original script was good and it had to be edited down or what This had potential and instead it was really a flop I would really like the hour and a half I invested in this movie back but the video rental place doesnt do returns on time Save your money and see something else,negative
The box at my video store is why I rented this one It looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course I had to give it a try I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched it being an Evil Dead fan The Swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece A criminal tries to break into the house Evil Ed was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says groovy as he looks at his weapon quite like Bruce Campbell does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2 There is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in the movie They dont just spoof Evil Dead as there is a Gremlin style puppet monster that cusses at Ed in his refrigerator My personal favorite is when he chases his wife around the house and says Im coming to get you Barbra which in case you didnt know is Barbras brothers main line in Night of the Living Dead This movie pretty much has it all good plot cool characters funny stuff Gremlin puppetscary stuff demon doctor excellent effects exploding head and a fair amount of female nudity I only gave it a 9 because its kind of slow before Ed goes insane but its well worth the wait So if you liked Evil Dead 2 or any of the other movies I mentioned above you gotta rent and watch it with a freind and when your done try Brain Dead because I hear it is similiar to this masterpiece br br ,positive
This movie causes more unintentional laughter than anything else Ive ever seen Really if you are a Tolkien fan rent it just to laugh at it with your friends I wont be the millionth person to rip apart its flaws all I will say is that the movie for me anyway lost major points for turning my favorite character Sam into a bumbling idiot Shame shame 310,negative

Copy cats have copied this movie from a 1974 Hindi movie called Call Girl Call Girl had an identical story line The way in which the protagonists fall in love then rebel and the climax all same in both these films Call Girl is better than Water at least from the story telling point of view It was not as agonizingly slow as Water Water on the contrary does not progresses at all The aim is perhaps to make the audience sympathize with Kalyani for ever Are Indian film makers any better than just being great copiers these days Well they call it being inspired In their language it is getting inspired without any citation that is ,negative
Heres the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching And mostly its for two reasons One it concentrates of young people VERY young people People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced The second reason is that is a love triangle And I do believe that as teens its the most dramatic And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or are just so new to love that they just strongly believe they are and after a tragedy or so occurs will believe it for the rest of their livesbr br The cast of The Man in the Moon is full of great talented names It stars Sam Waterston who is truly a versatile actor well capable of playing tough district attorneys as well as strict yet caring and wise fathers as in this film Also there is Tess Harper Jason London and a young young Reese Witherspoon You look at the young talented actress as she is at age fourteen and you think that about ten years down the road shes going to win the Academy Award All members of the cast pull off great performances and with the dialogue of the compelling screenplay they are enhanced into looking like real people in real situations As if it all really happened This the kind of movie that I would like to see come out more often Love story or not I would love to see films that make everything look real and is not phony or disbelievable in any way,positive
Set in Hungary in November 1956 this is the story of a group of foreign nationals who were trying to leave the country at the time of the Uprisingbr br Once the airport is closed the titular journey begins on a bus taking them to Austria As would be obvious they are stopped on their way which is where they come up against the almost faultless Yul Brynner whose military power as a Red Army Major was marked with loneliness his internal struggle between right and wrong his search for the truth and his need to feel emotions for other human beings He was saddened by the fact that his job had alienated him from his friends and enemies alike and he yearned for social contactbr br Robert Morley plays the quintessential stiff upperlipped Englishman who no matter how serious the role manages to maintain an almost lighthearted logical outlook on life while Jason Robards has a stunning movie debut which enforces the reason why he had so many roles throughout his career Deborah Kerr as the leading lady exhibits the grace and femininity we have come to associate with her yet manages to bring over the strength and resolve required for her characterbr br The film deals with a very tempestuous time in European history but it never ceases to remind us that there is good in all of us and you can never completely judge a book by the cover Fabulous scriptwriting ensures that for all the seriousness of the subject there can still be great oneliners and comedic instances that add to rather than detract from the movie The chemistry in the cat and mouse game between Kerr and Brynner makes you understand why they appeared in more than the one film togetherbr br All in all a thoroughly engrossing movie which I would definitely watch again 810,positive
I rented this one by accident I lifted the video up and looked at the back and thought shameless Blair Witch ripoff Then in a moment of carelessness I grabbed The Francisville Experiment thinking it was something else My horror upon arriving home and realizing my mistake was far more terrifying than anything this film had to offer Boring Characters bad acting and a feeling of we saw the Blair Witch Project and could do the same permeate the action to the point where watching on fast forward will lead you straight to the credits Im not one to fault film makers for being lazy or desperate but after this yawnfest I felt the need to warn everyone dont waste your time you have a life,negative
What a wonderful fanciful movie Stardust isbr br I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see itbr br At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats Stardust makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place  to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives other times or other planets Ironically Stardust takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long forbr br Stardust is full of all the characters we remember as children princes witches pirates ghosts and scoundrels It has the damsel in distress the hero the rogues the obstacles spells antidotes charms and even a touch of lightspeed to make it quasi modernbr br Stardust is about a man from the town of Wall which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger played wonderfully by David Kelly One day a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained and very sexy young lady named Una She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain While the witch is away Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life But nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect  a baby boybr br The boy named Tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man Charlie Cox who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another Nevertheless the young lady named Victoria and played Sienna Miller goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to her After they espy a falling star she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her He agrees and sets out on his quest which will take him to the other side of the wallbr br Meanwhile in the kingdom of Stormhold the old king perfectly played by Peter OToole is dying He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne His sons names are Primus Secondus Sextmus and Septimus The other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the thronebr br Anyway he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and Voila that what brings the star to earthbr br The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine Clare Danes and she of course is wearing the charm But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain the Princes and also an aging witch named Lamia Michelle Pfeiffer who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youthbr br Complicated Yes But it all comes together as the adventure unfoldsbr br Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria he doesnt recognize the growing bond between he and Yvaine His initial interest lie only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love But he must get past the princes and Lamia first The princes arent that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other  and just as in Pirates of the Caribbean  never has death been so funny br br But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother though he doesnt know its his mother and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNirobr br His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to a tee He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter Though his role is small in length DeNiro is extraordinarybr br Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia  a sexy evil witch Claire Danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed Yvaine She makes a perfect damsel Jason Flemyng Adam Buston Rupert Everett and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom as they die return as ghosts ala Blithe Spirit and High Spiritsbr br Moreover director Matthew Vaughn whose only other directing experience was Layer Cake weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoybr br Stardust may be too complex for young children but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times Its that good Stardust is what movies are supposed to be Perfectly written perfectly cast perfectly directed and perfectly acted In other wordsperfect,positive
This is a new Barbie movie The graphics were really good They made the movie seem partially realistic I used to do ballet and this movie made me want to continue it This movie was kind of like a Cinderella movie but a little bit different A father of 12 princesses gets very sick His cousin poisons him and wants the throne The girls find a secret magical land thanks to their dead mothers stories Its up to them to save their father and society With the help of their handsome prince It was a funny movie and me and my friend had fun watching it We enjoyed it a lot and also enjoyed the Indian talking parrot The music was very nice and made the movie even greater It had a great classical orchestra The voices were great and the characters were adorably sweet and cute I liked it so enjoy the movie its great for the family All in all Id watch it again,positive
This film is amazing and I would recommend to child and adult alike The animation is beautiful the characters are rich and interesting and the story is captivating far better than anything the American studios were producing at the time However there is a couple of caveats to this statement Its a shame that Disney bought the Studio Ghibli backcatalogue and then proceeded to butcher it My main point being Disney redubbed the film despite the original English version being very impressive The new cast with Van Der Beek et al ruined it and took away much of the attractiveness of the characters eg Pazu and Sheeta went from adventurous companions to whiny teenagers The Original music score is also far better than the Disney remix It begs the question why did Disney make such changes It seems to me is that by having Van Der Beek et al being cast then Disney can draw in more money which is fair enough but in the process they tainted they film It is still a beautiful film and I would still recommend it to anyone My main beef is that Disney ruined a film from childhood which I loved and still love I am lucky enough to have an original Japanese import with the original English dub which I am now going to guard with my life,positive
If it wasnt for the very attractive Jennifer Jostyn in the lead role I would have turned Milo off after the first 30 minutes However as easy on the eyes as she is shes not enough to save this film not by a long shotbr br Milo starts off with a group of young girls accompanying an assumed young boy in a yellow slicker to a house in the woods where he shows them embryos in jars Apparently the deal was that if he showed them the jars ol Milo gets to conduct a gynecologist exam on each in return One of the group volunteers to be Milos first patient and he leads her behind closed doors Moments later blood flows from under the door and we are whisked into present day Enter the lovely Jostyn who plays one of the girls all grown up in present day A substitute teacher with shallow confidence whose closest friend appears to be a goldfish she receives an invitation to return home for a friends wedding Yep You guessed it Return to Miloville Milo who allegedly drowned years ago seems to be having a dilemma staying dead and begins terrorizing and murdering the girls he failed to examine all those years agobr br Milo the character reminded me of one of the mutants from Cronenbergs The Brood He could have been scary but just how scary can a villain be who wears a yellow raincoat The plot confuses even itself and the conclusion left me wanting my 90 minutes back Im sending Milo an inept slasher film to stand in the corner,negative

A lot people get hung up on this films tag as a childrens film and that it certainly is though it is one made for adults Takashi Miike uses the fantasy genre particularly the childrens fantasy genre as a springboard into the wild territory that is the Great Yokai Warbr br The setup is simple a boy is selected to play the hero in this years annual festival only to discover his role is much more real than he could have imagined What follows is a hallucinatory grotesque whimsical and often funny journey through the world of Japanese folklore but wait theres also an evil Villain on the lose who wants to destroy the world However the villain here is not a mere demon it is the demonspirit of the accumulated resentment of those things which humans use and discard Usuing a chamber made out of pure liquid hateresentment the villain transforms the vibrant colorful Yokai spirits into soulless ten foot tall makeshift robots which chainsaw for arms and eyes like burning coalsthose whove played the video game Sonic The Hedghog might remember a certain Dr Robotnik performing similar procedures to the cute and cuddlys who Sonic had to then liberatebr br The hero in this film is actually the least interesting character essentially playing the straight man in a world gone suddenly mad Though he does go through the typical heroes trials he more often than not cowers as do many of the Yokia themselves who seem truly defenseless against the murderous robots some spirits being umbrellas with eyes talking walls or creatures whose soul purpose in life is to count beansof course in this magical world of Miikes Yokai war even beans take a magical power when one believes in thembr br In several ways this film subverts the normal conventions of childrens fantasy as few if any of the characters are heroic their victory being a combination of happenstance almost arbitrary faith and a desire to party The Yokai spirits only rally together and lay siege the villains hideout after they mistake the end of the world invasion of Earth for a great Yokai festival and even then only to dance and party Also the film ends not with the usual celebratory alls well that ends well fantasy ending but with a final scene showing our hero years older with an adult job now unable to see the Yokai spirits of his youth who then despondently turn to the villain who being a spirit can never really die This ending with its Yokai spirit who is the spitting image of Pokemons Pikachu warns us not just of leaving behind our childhood selves but of the horrors of overconsumption The villain is resentment caused when humans no longer have reverence for the world and the objects around themin Japanese folklore nearly every object has some kind of spirit and so when they are used and discarded as we in consumer societies do without reverence they become soulless vengeful machines not unlike those seen in modern video games suggesting that though our imaginations and myths do not ever really die but can become deformedbr br This is one of the first scripts Miike has contributed to and I believe it shows as theres a tightness conceptually that sometimes gets swept under the rug by his exuberance for visual playfulness Though Ive focused mostly on the story since lots of users here seem to write it off I do want to say that visually its a kaleidescope of CGI stop animation costume and live puppetry that works remarkably well Theres a dreamlike quality to a lot of the film and the Miyazaki comparisons are warranted as are the NeverEnding Story and Labrynth comparisons though this film is sharper and more adult than either The Yokai are beaten brutalized and turned into machines of living hate who I believe even kill a few humans a deformed aborted calf with a mans face is born and dies in the films grotesque opening while a sexual undercurrent the women with the long neck licking the face of our boy hero or another characters persistent memory of touching the thigh of a young scantily clad water spirit as a boy seem to linger a bit too long for most western tastes especially when considering this is a childrens film However these are slight enough to catch adult attentions while minor enough not to traumatize any children to bad Grims fairy tales before revisions did much worse far more oftenbr br All and all this is one of Miikes most accessible and engaging ventures yet with enough visual drama and great performancesthe Yokai spirits have a humanism and an absurd humor to them thats laugh out loud funny at times to appeal to audiences of all ages and a steady conceptual undercurrent strong enough to draw in an adult audience who have presumably brought their children or else come out of a sense of nostalgia for the long lost fantasy films of their youth The latter group the film seems to address the most fervently asking that they not just continue passive consumption of the world around them but show reverence to those spirits within them which seemed so much closer to reality in childhood Another beautiful funny and truly original film from a thrilling director who hasnt come close to his apex Instant classic,positive
The original Road House is by no means an award winning film But it is one of the great guilty pleasures of all time It shouldnt have been that hard to make a sequel Theres no need for a big budget big name stars and spectacular visual effects Even the story didnt have to be original All it needed was a good time vibe and some great fist fights I dont mean Matrixstyle wirefu just some well choreographed barroom brawls Lots of them There are a couple of decent fights in the movie but none of them are memorable and the focus is more on gun play Plus the way it ties in to the original film is laughable bordering on insulting Johnathon Schaech plays Shane Tanner an undercover DEA agent who is good with his hands and feet But heres the kickerhes the son of Patrick Swayzes character Dalton Say what Lets see the original Road House was made in 1989 So for Dalton to have a son in his late 20s maybe even 30 in 2006well you get the idea They give it a cheesy explanation that he lived with his uncle Nate Will Patton while his father travelled around a lot Oh please That itself almost warranted shutting this movie off But I digress Schaech is completely out of his element Sure he can throw a couple of kicks but hes got nothing going on as an actor Plus hes referred to in the movie by the bad guys as pretty boy Ive never scrutinized men that closely but I dont think this guy is too good looking He looks sick His face is way too thin and his sunken eyes make it look like hes going to pass out at any moment Id never heard of him before but I think he should give up acting and go back to his day job Jake Busey plays the local drug runner Wild Bill Busey is not a terrible actor He was good in Starship Troopers and even made a menacing villain in Hitcher 2 But here he just chews the scenery in standard bad guy mode Even his threating dialog is yawn worthy Were supposed to buy him as the man that has the whole town in his pocket But why What does he do Because he wants to buy a bar from Patton by any means necessary Ellen Hollman has the token girlfriend role A woman with a secret Too bad that secret is about as difficult to figure out as 22 Shes the local elementary school teacher who happens to be a former Army soldier Guess what that means It means that while she may quiver with fear for the majority of the movie shell be ready to smash heads when the fur starts to fly Oh well at least shes hot Actually the fight between her and Wild Bills girl is the best one in the movie Its fast brutal and entertaining Which leads me to my next problem with the moviethe fights As I said Schaech knows how to throw a punch The same cant be said for anyone he faces in the movie Obviously the movie will all come down to Schaech versus Busey Busey is an actor not a fighter He doesnt possess the skills to pull of a movie fight Swayze may have been a trained dancer but his athletic ability gave him the means to pull off well choreographed fights He also faced a couple of worthy opponents and had one killer literally move None of that here With a couple of exceptions the fights are forced poorly staged and routine The punches sound like someone smacking a 2X4 on the concrete and theres even a couple of parts where the sound doesnt even match up to the punch Its embarrassing There isnt even the good southernredneck music of the original Road House had the Jeff Healy Band who were a somewhat popular band at the time This movie features a singer called John Otto whose music is tepid and his acting even worse Hes given one line in the movie which was probably inserted to appease whatever fans he may have out there Either that or someone owed him a favor My final complaint about the movie is one that comes out of just being pickythe continuity Movies are shot out of sequence and then its the editors job to piece it all together Well someone should give the editor of this movie a little shove The problems range from little things like people not looking the same direction when a shot changes to REUSED footage at the end of the movie In the beginning we are introduced to the bar The Black Pellican As the camera moves through the bar you see the band the bouncers and the people dancing At the end of the movie when the bad guys have been defeated we get another shot of the same bar with insert shots of our hero sitting at the bar with his girl The problem is the footage of the people in the bar is the SAME footage from the beginning of the movie I kid you not Its the same people standing or dancing in the same places wearing the same clothes Want to know the funniest part You see bouncers in the shot that were KILLED earlier in the movie Do yourself a favor dont watch this movie unless YOU feel the need to go out and punch someone This movie will make you angry enough to do it,negative
If the screenwriter and director intended to open hearts with the movie as the musician wanted to do with his music they succeeded with me Commonplace human situations became original personal and immediate so that I personally felt touched by each situation I believe I would credit the power of music combined with the point of view of the person writing the movie Without spoiling I can say that I was very moved by the movies approach to living Havent actually cried out ofwhat joy empathy just deep emotion in a very long time I would love to find a way to show it to others Saw it at Seattle International Film Festival,positive
This is one of those films that you watch with a group of people You will have the best time Its really really bad like Showgirls bad but without the quality of Showgirlsbr br Youve got the best mix of bad actors bad director and bad script here Everything that can possible be wrong that can make for an entertaining evening you have here The first being the tag line is a bunch of teenagers These people are as much teenagers as my grandmotherbr br The director has zero sense of suspense or tension The 30 year old teenagers are standing around and the monster comes out and attacks and this pretty much happens throughout the movie when the monsters are revealed There is no suspense building up to this or surprise or anything Its more like when you were kids pretending to be chased by monsters and just kind of made up stuff as you went And when I use the word monsters I exaggerate More like a couple guys in Halloween masks bought at the 99 cent storebr br There is no doubt this script was spun off in a couple days no rewrites and I can only imagine how bad and poorly formatted it looked on the page because it was clearly written by an amateur with no clue Its another example of one of the bad things about this day and age anyone can make a moviebr br But of course the best bad thing about this film is the acting Its as bad as you can get There isnt one person in this who has the slightest skill at acting and the lead is the absolute worst He delivers every line in this monotone manner without any expression and you have to wonder how someone this bad could possible get a part in any movie no matter who he knows When he had to cry when his girlfriend was killed it was one of the funniest scenes Ive ever seen in a movie Watching these people reciting some of the awful dialog is very very funny But when the black guy said tell hertell herI love her before his death scene there was a huge laugh among our group Funny funny stuffbr br My only hope is this movie gets bad enough ratings to take its place where it belongs in the IMDb lowest rating 100 movies We can do it folksbr br PS Is it any surprise that the one great comment this movie got in here was from someone in Virginia who has one comment only on this movie and nothing else And guess where the movie was made Virginia Ive said it before and Ill say it again people who work on the movie should NOT be allowed to comment on it,negative
I watched this one mostly to see Charlie Ruggles and Una Merkel two of my favoritesbr br The plot has many a twist and turn  its not bad as a straight mystery aboard a trainbr br But why throw in a circus train wreck and an escaped gorilla I can mention this without it being a spoiler because the circus train wreck and the gorilla have nothing to do with the intricate mystery plotbr br The bad person trying to kill the good people has many tricks up his sleeve but the circus train wreck was purely coincidental It allows for a single scene with a menacing gorilla but then its back to the murder mystery,negative
I watched this film few times and all i can say that this is low budget rubbish and that it does not have anything to do with a real history facts Actors performances is very poor but it is result of limited acting possibilities Anyone who watched this film now probably think of Hitler as some crazy skinny lunatic who running with a gun like some Chicago gangster I can only to say that there is much better films about Hitler and Germany in those years and that Rise of evil is very much under average I can recommend German film Downfall in which you can see brilliant performance of Switzerland actor Bruno Ganz in a roll of Adolf Hitler,negative
I was sitting at home and flipping channels when I ran across what potentially sounded like an interesting film I like Destruction type movies and decided to watch it I dont know why but I ended up watching it the whole 2 hours We have seen this type of movie I dont know how many timesbr br Back in 1998  2000 there were dozen of films that dealt with global destruction of some sort The best one on my list so far is Deep Impact which was more believable than this one Here are my problems with this film 1 cheap special effects like something out of the old computer 2 no background information or explanation on weather patterns If you are going to make a movie about weather at least have some decency to entertain the viewer with technical details 3 How come only 2 or 3 people figure out that the storm is converging on Chicago no more experts left in the field 4 where are some interesting characters I truly dont care for anyone except maybe the pregnant woman I felt that there was no character development 5 no thought provoking moment what so ever and factually incorrect theme And this is only the first part of the film I bet the conclusion will show us few destruction scenes and a search and rescue operation just like it has been done many times before And judging by the special effects in the first part of the movie I can only imagine what we are to expect Of course at the end the main characters will survive and life will go on how original,negative
If youre looking to be either offended or amused or both youll probably have to look elsewhere LMOTP really isnt even very thought provoking beyond rehashing the usual silly clichés At the end of the second episode I felt a little embarrassed that I actually sat through the contrived messbr br Beyond the thinly veiled gimmicky premise thats attracted all the initial attention to it in the first place its just another lame innocuous and antiseptic attempt at commentary and entertainment that the CBC typically excels at producing And once the ZOMG MUSLIMS IN RURAL CANADA ROFLMAO hype wears out its welcome the show is likely to follow into the ether of cancellation because its so shallow when judged on its merits alonebr br Unless youre obsessed with Muslim culture in the west andor are easily amused by the most minute idiosyncrasies on the subject I really dont see how LMOTP is enjoyable beyond satisfying the curiosity that stemmed from the hype Other shows have better addressed the issue of culturalethnic dichotomy in western multiethnic societies LMOTP will never rank among them in entertainment or insight,negative
This is the worst waste of time Ive ever experienced not even close to the first one The story line difficult to follow  plot was weak  at best The whole thing looked like three stories trying some way to tie them together and make a movie It had a few good lines here and there  and the attempt at the message was admirable but they went from Houston through New York to get to Dallas It was really hard to tell over what period of time the present time took up The movie was just over an hour and it felt like we had sat there watching the movie all afternoon Mayve points for being honest  but a son should not have to do all that Kronk felt he had to do Do your self a favor  Watch Kuzco again,negative
As someone who used to spend hours driving around the backstreets of North London in an attempt to avoid the horrific congestion this film immediately appealed Throw in my interest in what London was like back in the late 70s and you have the basic premise for my version of TV heaven On paper the film ticked all the right boxes and having just watched The Knowledge the actual movie itself certainly lived up to if not exceeded my high expectationsbr br Visually I was surprised how different London looked back then I lived in Islington in the 90s long after gentrification had transformed the area It truly came across as grimy tatty and downatheel London may still have bad housing estates but the general feel of the place is much cleaner brighter and pleasant nowadays based on what this movie shows rather than my own memoriesbr br As for the story and the acting well top marks obviously go to Nigel Hawthorne as The Vampire Absolutely brilliant He acts deliberately unpredictably alternating between total straightfaced severity and surreal mindgames in order to unnerve the Knowledge Boys as he puts them through test after testbr br All in all this was an excellent thoroughly enjoyable trip back into a very specific time and place that I find endlessly fascinating But even if youre not especially interested in London circa 1979 youll still enjoy following the witty dialogue and likable characters of The Knowledge,positive
Youd think youre in for some serious sightseeing when the premise of the movie takes place primarily between two characters as they travel 3000 miles or so from France to Saudi Arabia going through most of Europe  Italy Bulgaria Croatia Slovenia Turkey before arriving in the Middle East But this is not a tour and there are no stopovers for soaking in the sightsbr br Redas father is in his twilight years and wishes to do the Haj However since walking and taking the mule is out of the question he chooses to travel to Mecca by car He cant drive and therefore enlists the help of Reda to his sons protest to get him there in their broken down vehiclebr br But Reda doesnt see the point of having him go along when his dad could opt for the plane He resents the idea of having put his personal life on hold for this pilgrimage he couldnt understand And hence we set off in this arduous journey with father and son being not the best of palsbr br The beauty of this movie is to witness the development of the father and son pair the challenges they face the weird people they meet having to duke it out in varied weather conditions and alternating rest stops between motels and sleeping in the car We see an obvious generation gap in them trying to communicate to each other the father trying to impose on his son and the son trying to assert himself as an adult but circumstances we see reveal that Reda is quite a fish out of water Through the many encounters they actually team up quite well despite their differencesbr br Its perhaps quite apt to have this film released here last week to coincide with Hari Raya Haji and having the opportunity to watch our protagonists join the other pilgrims in their Haj The final scene in Mecca is truly a sight to behold and you too would feel the claustrophobia and fear as Reda tries to hunt down his dad amongst the thousands of people congregating The sights of Europe were perhaps deliberately not dwelled upon so as to build up the anticipation of and focus on the final destinationbr br It certainly rang home the thought of telling and showing loved ones how much you appreciate them for who they are Dont miss this and yes book early  I was pleasantly surprised that this evenings session was still a full house,positive
Tesis Open your eyes and The Others were proof of Amenabars talent and skill as a filmmaker but in my humble opinion were also flawed films in their attempt to outsmart the audience always offering one turn of the screw too many favoring cheap thrills twists and turns over depth and resonance Lucky for everyone Amenabar chose a subject for his new film that would not allow a surprise ending focusing on characters and the emotional ties that bind them br br The result is a little miracle of a film beautifully written photographed scored acted and directed Everyone involved in this film delivers a carrerhigh performancebehind and in front of the cameras from the wonderful cast Bardem shines but Mabel Rivera Celso Bugallo Clara Segura and Lola Dueñas give the film an amazing authenticity to Aguirresarobes exquisite lensing br br The film taps on many relevant issues and emotions effectively  it addresses heart and mind with equal power and delivers a final punch that stays with you long after the credits roll This is a brilliantly executed film that not only will stand as a landmark in Spanish cinema but will surely become a pleasant surprise when it opens in the abroad Sony Classics has paid a record 6 million dollars to distribute it Dont be surprised it it manages to get in the Oscar race Theres no stopping Amenabarbr br Buen trabajo Alejandro,positive
This low budget crocodile movie really delivers the goods The fact that it was inspired by true events would mean little if you wound up with a fake looking crocodile bad CGI or an obvious studio setting Fortunately none of the above are involved with this terrific very realistic film The crocodile is real there is no CGI and the on location filming takes place in an actual Australian swamp The actors were obviously inspired to create as much realism as possible in their performances and they succeed You can place yourself in their predicament which is testament to how realistically Black Water translates as entertainment Highly recommended  MERK,positive
Since this movie was based on a true story of a woman who had two children and was not very welloff it was just scary as to how real it really was The acting is what gave the movie that push to greatnessbr br Diane Keaton portrayed the main character Patsy McCartle who had two sons whom she adored Her performance is what made the real life story come to life on a television screen It was very hard to watch some of the scenes since they were so real as to what happens when one becomes addicted to drugsbr br Just watching this very loving mother go from sweet to not caring at all was hard but so true I have known people who have gone through withdrawl and it was very much like what happened in this movie from what I rememberbr br I also thought that it was very risky for the director to want to make a movie out of what happened to this woman Yet it was done so well I applaud the director for making this moviebr br I highly recommend this to anyone who has known someone who has ever been addicted to drugs or to just learn what can happen to you if you do become addicted to them,positive
I remember watching Police Squad when it first came on ABC in 1982 and I thought it was a very funny show thanks to the many sight gags non sequitors and scripts filled with word play In one episode there was a line where a man named Once was shot twice br br But unfortunately ABC canceled the show after only six episodes I felt it deserved a much longer run but a network executive thought the show demanded too much attention of the viewer because of all the sight gags in each episode One that I remember was in the opening where the episodes title was different from the one shown on the screen br br Leslie Nielsens portrayal of Frank Drebin was deadpan yet very funny and his role was in the narrative style of Jack Webb of Dragnet Alan North did well and Peter Lupus in one of his few roles since Mission Impossible wasnt bad as Norberg But the one character that stood out was Johnny the Shoeshine Boy played by William Duell After giving advice to Drebin there were cameos from Dick Clark Dr Joyce Brothers and then Dodger manager Tommy LaSorda br br Even though Police Squad had a short life on ABC the Zucker Brothers didnt give up on the concept which turned out even more successful in the Naked Gun movie franchise Ill close with a regular closing gag Freeze the ending right here,positive
If you take the movie for what it is worth you wont be disappointed If you think Murray is supposed to win an Oscar for his performance and that is the type of movie you are expecting dont bother It was funny when I saw it in 1979 and hasnt lost its charm Good clean fun for the kids and mindless entertainment for the older folks The story line is simple and easy to follow Murray has done better but this is his first film The movie reminds me of a time when we didnt need blood and guts to be entertained Morty is the head dunce and plays the part perfect The other counselors are typical revved up teens looking to have fun during the summer One nice thing about this movie it has a message,positive

Anyone giving this movie a good review obviously must have had something to do with its creation This movie is a painful suckfest The acting is stiff the stock generic soundtrack is laughable the direction is bland and strangest of all the teacher really isnt all that attractive making the students blatant advances all the more awkward The creative minds behind this trash should disband and spread out to prevent further displays of such concentrated craptitude Im certain that some starving kids in Africa could have used the money squandered on this project Hell the funds would have also seen a more enlightened purpose fueling a crackaddict at least someone would be getting some entertainment out of it For the sole reason that it didnt give me a terminal illness Ill give this film a two,negative
Brainless film about a good looking but brainless couple who decide to live their dream and take people on diving tours The pair almost instantly make the wrong choice of customers and get mixed up with some people seeking to recover the items that we see falling to the ocean floor during the opening credits sequence Great looking direct to video movie could have been so much better if it wasnt so interested in primarily looking good Performances are serviceable and the plot is actually not bad or would have been had the director and producers not redirected the plot into making sure we see lots of shapely people in bathing suits or in what Im guessing the reason for the unrated moniker a few fleeting bare breasts The film never generates any tension nor rises above the level of a forgettable TV movie If you get roped in to seeing this you wont pluck your eyes out since the eye candy is pleasant but we really need to stop producers from making films that are excuses to have a paid vacation,negative

however I am not one of them Caro Diario at least was watchable for two thirds of the time but the boring and selfcentred third section of that movie gave us a taste of what was to come in this extraordinarily selfindulgent mess Moretti says he feels a need to make this movie but doesnt want to whereas the viewer feels that he should stick with it but really doesnt want to either A film about Italian politics and elections could be fascinating but this is not that film At one point Moretti and his friends are standing outside the Communist Party headquarters discussing the interviews they are preparing to conduct with Party leaders inside but its characteristic of this film that we never get to see anything of them Interposed with Morettis political ravings are the events leading up to the birth of his son and subsequent home movie shots of him with the baby and later the infant Pietro the film drags us through several years and more than one election period We keep expecting to see some definitive sequence or cogent argument but they never come I for one doubt that I could have the patience to ever sit through a Nanni Moretti movie again He succeeds in making an hour and twenty minutes seem like an eternity,negative
I know that the real story of Little Richard is a lot more thrilling than this maudlin and thoroughly average biopic But then producer Little Richard was probably too reluctant to bring to light any sordid details of his life and just gave us a forgettable facsimile of his career highlights from the 50s and 60s,negative
I was quite excited when I saw this film in competition at the Montreal Film Festival Along with Elephant and a few others I thought the issue of American gun violenceculture would be treated intelligently and in a fashion compelling for filmgoers The pressrelease promised in not so many words a Red Violin for the gunviolence crowd something to make us ponder our NRAshootemup mindset in this countrybr br After waiting until after 915 to be seated for a 9AM screening what technical difficulties they would have encountered is beyond me we were finally let into the venue to see the film on DV where did the advertised 35MM print go I think I just answered my first questionbr br The result is an abhorrent mess We get the gun in a vignette with the most unrealistic biker I have ever seen and I do know more than a few The film then lapses into irrelevant character development only because the characters are either a stereotyped b losers c stereotyped losers andor d racial caricatures It takes another 30 minutes to get to the plot movement and once we are there we wish for the inane conversations between the couples andor the bikers and pawn brokersbr br The film finds its conclusion but not without leaving any cliché untried I didnt care for the whitetrash characters who came in contact with the gun and the depiction of the minority characters should have the NAACP crying foul immediately All these people WOULD chase after a gun because they are at the bottom of the societal trashheap and would look for an opportunity wherever it was found Placing the action a level up would have at least provided some soulsearching on the part of the charactersbr br The biggest problem is the promise unfulfilled The plot outline was great In the hands of a PT Anderson or Gus Van Zandt it could have been a powerful piece But due either to bad screenplay direction or both the thing is an unmitigated mess that needs to be ignored at all costsbr br My bigger question is who at the MFF thought this was competition material Better bury this on Showtime at 3AMbr br Art Blose,negative
This movie sat in a dusty stack of videos in my house for ages before we watched it We knew it was there every time someone wanted to watch a movie it was suggested It almost became a joke I know lets watch Throw Momma from the Train I dont know why it was always turned down it just was Little did we know what we were missing out on It still befalls me why it took us so longI mean it stars Danny DeVito Billy Crystal and Ann Ramsy who we referred to as The Lady from the Goonies an all star cast that should have appealed to everyone in my household But there it sat for nearly ten years Until one day it was suggested and we could turn it down no longerbr br It was like finding King Tuts tombbr br No movie has ever made me laugh so hard and I doubt any movie ever will I had to rewind for almost every line because I was still laughing at the line that came before it and lost ability to hear or pay attention Not just simple laughing either the kind of laughing that expends more energy than running ten miles in the cold The kind of laughing that you cannot control that causes rolling around and spasms and tears and snot running down your face because its just that freakin funny Once I learned the movie by heart I will say this effect has lessened but I dont think I will get tired of watching it and finding new quirks in it to appreciate I think thats all I can say I would recommend this movie to anyone but if you dont enjoy it please dont let me know I will probably be offended,positive
Yes this is one of the better done television movies and I wouldnt expect less from Joe Sargent One thing for this reviewer is that I was also a great fan of The Carpenters I got to sing all of their material in elementary school and middle school choir and I got to do much of the solo material of which Karen sang lead I thought she was one of the most wonderful pop singers of the 70s  and being a childteen singing these songs and learning music  the one thing I was looking forward to was meeting this woman I never got to she died three weeks before that was to happen And yes that did effect me for I knew nothing of anorexia  and could not understand completely what happenedbr br When this TV movie got produced I got quite an understanding Maybe not everything in Karen and Richards life is open to the television audience but in opening the parts that were shown I got to understand much from the music industry of that time What upsets me is that I am writing of that time and seeing now No one has learned a darned thing even though this was a very informative and heartfelt look into a familys problems in the music industrybr br These films arent done for fun theyre done to open a door and show us something Here was a wonderful woman who got caught up in the whole idea that her talent was based on weight She was fine Didnt know it She got mixed messages about her weight from the brother she loved the parents she loved and the music industry that cared more about her looksweight than the talent within With the onset of MTV it got worse With American Idol its like a puss festering in an English accentbr br A wonderful TV film I am sure later someone may give it an HBO treatment but either way many lessons to be learned and the absence of another wonderful talent,positive
Never viewed this film and enjoyed the singing and dancing by Cagney and the other cast members namely Dick Powell Scott Blair who had a great tenor voice and Ruby Keeler Bea Thorn James Cagney plays the role as Chester Kent who writes musicals and eventually goes into producing Prologues which are shown in between the feature films shown in movie theaters during the 1930s Chester has trouble with people trying to steal his ideas for his shows This is a very entertaining film with lots of comedy and plenty of laughs Joan Blondell Nan Prescott gave a great supporting role who was also very young and pretty Dick Powell was great as a singer and dancer and just starting out with his long and successful screen career Enjoy,positive
Unbelievablebr br this film gets a 7 out 0f 10 This has to be one of the worst films i have seen in years not only was the acting incredibly bad the storyline if you can call it that was just as bad Offcourse everyone knows whats going to happen within the first 5 minutes Which is not a bad thing if you can captivate the audience during leading up to that moment That however is not the case There is no action no suspense not even a spark between the 2 leading actors It was unfortunately a waste of my time and certainly a waste of my money br br and the 2 of merely for trying,negative
I was just looking at the 100 bottom movies according to IMDb users seeing if there was anything to review that I havent yet and I found this little screen gem One of those occasions when you see a movie ranked as one of the worst and you just have to be one of the few that actually likes it Darn well I guess I will get ridiculed and spat upon here but for me this was a pretty good flick when I saw it It has been awhile however I remember it used to come on HBO late at night and I watched it two or three times and I havent seen it really since and I would love to watch it again now knowing Jolie was in it The story follows a cyborg and a guy trying to escape the clutches of this corporation and some bounty hunters after them I think that is basically all there is to it throw in a few scenes with Jack Palance and we have our movie Some good action here and there and some blood and violence as well There is also a love story at play as well as the female cyborg and the guy who trained her to fight kind of fall in love with each other The dialog sometimes becomes rather bad at times and it is by far not a top notch film but for a bmovie it is really good I dont know if it was a theatrical release though because it does not seem high quality enough for that but it does make for one of the better direct to videos if it was one of those,positive
I really am shocked to see the number of reviews that lambaste this movie This movie was not intended to be a deep thought movie which is what the vast majority of the reviewers seem to think it should be In fact it would appear that if ANY movie doesnt produce a life altering insight and a deep twisted mind boggling plot they would rate it a 1 or 2 Dont trash a movie because you dont like the genre peoplebr br This movie was an ActionComedy flick and thats all it was intended to be And for an ActionComedy it was very well done I was actually rather surprised that I enjoyed it as much as I did having never really been a Jamie Foxx fan and having the overused plot that it hasbr br The plot was nothing spectacular using the typical criminal gets out of prison and is thrown into badguy plot while trying to clean up his act See Blue Streak Hudson Hawk 48 Hours etc etc etc but it was warmed over with a bit of a technological twist Now the bad guys are actually the good guys and the REAL bad guy is an ubergeekbr br Jamie Foxx actually plays a convincingly humorous while at the same time rather intelligent and serious main character and didnt try to overdo the humor side of the filmbr br If youre looking for a deep underlying plot such as in The Matrix or a drama such as Of Mice and Men then this movie isnt for you But if you enjoy the raw action excellent fastpaced filming and an occasional twist of humor tossed in this movie wont disappoint you I would normally have rated it about an 8 on the same level as the Die Hard Trilogy but instead gave it a 10 to try and bring the score up to what it SHOULD bebr br ,positive

This weeks surprise screening at GV turned out to be the horror movie The Nun La Monja Seriously I think that horror movies should try and come up with more imaginative titles even though the storys about the character as described in the title Who knows soon well have spinoffs like The Monk The Priest and others belonging to various religious sectsbr br The basic premise goes very simply that a ghoul dressed up in a Nun garb so that it can lay claim to the title goes around killing exconvent girls There seemed to be some sort of conspiracy involved as the daughter of one of the victims Eva played by an eye candy Icelandic Anita Briem goes on to discover with the help of a few good friends like a rip off of I Know What You Did Last Summer mentioned also by the waybr br So as the body count increases its a race against time for our emotionally scarred arent they always heroine to uncover the truth and save the day Delving into the sins of the mothers the movie did the unthinkable that with a dream sequence as the introduction I hate dream sequences as its a pretty cheap technique if not done correctly and there are a couple of them in the moviebr br In part the movie played at times like JuOn gone wrong with the plenty of Dark Water references and they could have retitled this Unholy Water for the circumstances and plot points in the movie However there are plot holes abound so dont be looking into the storyline too deeply Youd come to expect the standard textbook twists towards the end about the sadistic nun and sets which look like they can rival recent Thai horror movie Dormbr br The actings pretty forgettable with the cast speaking in perfect heavily accented English And since most of them are pleasing to the eye the story must weave in a love scene in the middle of a witchhunt What gives Hello got hantu still got mood ah Then again the ghoul is a pretty cheap animatedSFX which has a built in AI of popping up every now and then in various fashion just to elicit screams from timid audiences The characters also break every unwritten rule in the DoNots in horror lore so you know and expect their just dessertsbr br Can you possibly enjoy this movie Sure you can Just ensure that youre watching it in a full house should be easy since local folks are suckers for anything remotely horrific and laugh at those who are so jumpy they scream at every frightening scene Its pretty fun and adds to the atmosphere besides whats going on the screen Surround sound doesnt even come closebr br Think of it as watching an episode of Scooby Doo without the wisecracks and its a pity that the gory moments in the movie had to be censored for a PG rating Those could possibly have been the best bits now left rotting on the censors floor board,negative
Typically kids films have some annoying quality to it that makes it way too sappy and unbearable for someone over 13 But then again thats before Holes hit the scene Sure it has the very same moments that often times give a kids movie its aforementioned quality but this film does a good job of staying away from such conventions The acting was decent and the uneasy dynamics that Stanley had with some of the other campers was more realistic than what most movies seek to portray What I especially liked about this movie was the fact that this film didnt try to break your heart or make you cry The emotional power was a little more natural than most would imagine kind of like The Shawshank Redemption in many ways which Holes also has a similar redemptive ending to it The only down side The hokey looking lizards Overall however an 810,positive
First of all Id like to say that I love the Ladies Man sketch on SNL I always laugh out loud at Tim Meadows portrayal of Leon Phelps However there is a difference between an 8minute sketch and a featurelength movie Watching Leon doing his show and making obscene comments to his listeners and coming up with all sorts of segments for his show like The Ladies Man Presents which is reminiscent of Alfred Hitchcock Presents is absolutely hilarious Theres a great episode where Cameron Diaz roleplays Monica Lewinski and Leon plays Bill and they call it The Oral Office See thats funny br br In the movie we dont see Leon on the show too often In fact he gets kicked out of almost every radio station in the country And the plot revolves around his quest for true love involving a mystery letter that got dropped off at his houseboat signed by Sweet Thing Karyn Parsons who is famous for playing Hillary on Fresh Prince of Bel Air works with him on the show and has a secret crush on Leon The movie just piles on one boring subplot after another And the gags are boring as well The first time we see Leon mention the word wang its pretty funny When he uses it over and over again supposedly trying to get a laugh the joke has run dry Most of the jokes he uses in the film are jokes we heard before and done better on the SNL sketch and played out tediously for a whole hour and twentyfive minutes They even try to insert a musical number by Will Ferrell and his gang of Ladies Man haters who all want to destroy him because their wives had an affair with him to bring some life into this witless comedy Ferrell has some funny moments and tries to make the best out of an otherwise unfunny role Ferrell just has that unique comic talent and hes funny at almost anything he does Even Julianne Moore gets a cameo Watching her you cant but wonder What the hell is an Oscarwinning actress doing in this movie Her name wasnt mentioned in the opening creditsprobably by her consent And of course a movie of this theme has to include the Master of Love himself Billy Dee Williams Billy Dee is charismatic as always but even he cant breathe enough life into this film I also have to add that the soundtrack is full of soft R  B hits which impairs the film even more giving it a horribly downbeat toneas if the script isnt boring enough I mean this is supposed to be a comedy The soundtrack wouldve been appropriate for something like Love Jones br br The Ladies Man only has sporadic laughs There are exceptions in which SNL can produce a great movie out of a short sketch Watch both of the Waynes World movies and youll see how its done But this movie just like adapting Mary Catherine Gallaghers character to screen in Superstar shows the flip side Some sketches are meant to be remembered on SNL and not on the silver screenbr br My score 3 out of 10,negative

I rarely give ratings less than 5 but in this instance I must weigh in Elmore Leonard is a great writer with many wonderful complex books original characters crisp dialogue invigorating plot twists Films based on his books go way back to Hombre Paul Newman Mr Majestyk Bronson and Out of Sight Clooney  Lopez among others Even when done soso the films at least have some measure of story essence coming through This one  it is simply not a worthy addition to the catalogbr br The acting is bad I do not know why because these are very capable people here and the story is handled with stupidity The characters are rearranged the chemistry is missing the actors and actresses are miscastbr br Since Elmore Leonard is a really great story teller I would hope that anyone who does not know his work would be dissuaded from reading his books because they saw this disappointing rendition of one of his storiesbr br The story is a sequel to Get Shorty If you have not seen that film do not watch this If you have seen Get Shorty do not proceed to thisbr br I saw Be Cool a few years back and tonight have been revisiting the vid The first time must not have made such a negative impression because I had forgotten how dismal this sequel wasbr br Fortunately I think no less of those who appeared in this film for having done so They probably expected something more Get Shorty was original and great fun Travolta I nearly always like but he is so much better in Tarantinos Pulp Fiction and in the preceding Get Shorty He was clearly unable to enjoy whatever was going on herebr br And I hear Freaky Deakyanother Elmore Leonard book is in preproduction for 2008 release Hopefully they can pull it offbr br Read the books They are almost all great,negative
This is what happens when a franchise gets lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add Remember what happened to the Childs Play series The first three were played as horror films with genuine scares albeit predictable that held true to the theme of the movie Then they ran out of folks for the doll to stalk and decided to play it for laughs with the next two being black comediesbr br Well thats what happened here but I think it was not meant to be like that Kind of like saying I WANTED to make pancakes for dessert I did this on purpose when your soufflé accidentally fizzles flat But the milk was spilled and it had some value in the theaters as a goofbr br When the floor ripped out from under the passenger seats I sort of expected the passengers to extend their legs through the hole start running FlintstonesStyle to safely land the plane in the Alps I did It would have fit into the silly campy theme of the rest of the showbr br Instead of pointing out the obvious physical impossibilities of the film what about the social implausibilities Like having George Kennedys character react calmly to the news that his date was a whore Even back in 1979 a man would not easily accept the notion that he has just poured his heart out to a paid companion He supposedly felt he made a connection with a kindred spirit who is subsequently shown to be a mercenary sexworker with a comeon line Who WOULDNT feel cheated by the experience And yet he giggles and wraps his arms around his buddys waist as they merrily stroll off What a cheap wrap up of a sleazy scene Ouchbr br I had an appetite for soufflé and got served insipid cliché pancakes And no you did NOT do it on purpose,negative

With the exception of the main character the acting didnt convince me but the story was quite good Its about a love affair between a gay party boy and a young Mormon missionary As you can imagine such a relationship is quite problematic The movie is very American and as such has some metaphysical undertones to counterbalance its criticism of religious intolerance But some story lines are hilarious one of the main characters asks his gay colleague Do you believe in God And he answers you mean other than Madonna All in all the film is not one of my alltime favorites but the script is really good and I really liked it its entertaining and stands up against religious prejudice and intolerance I think this is an important message in our times Since I rated films that I liked less with 9 this is clearly a 10 for me Some people may find this exaggerated but I think this film deserves it,positive
When I first watched Zoey101 with my sister we thought it was a piece of garbage No one is that rich and lives at a dorm off the pacific coast In the show Zoey is a mega popular rich girl that everyone always go to her for advice Zoey is always the one with the good idea and everyone agrees with her no matter how stupid her idea is She is always perfect at everything including her perfect figure And she is such a dietetic freak she talks about carbs like she knows what they are When she sees that her friends are eating chocolate she confiscates it And another thing that ticks me off is that she is always chewing a piece of spearmint every time you look at her And everyone wants something do with her for example in one episode that Logan guy bid 4000 to have her and her friends cheer for everything he does in his pathetic life And her friend Nicole is an overly perky freak that screams a lotAnd Lola dresses like a hoochie Houdini lady 80s called they want there bushy hair backMight as well shave off the hair chase This show sends a bad message to kids everywhere to make them think that if they dont have the latest IPods and designer clothes they will hate themselves br br This show is a big thumbs down br br We hate you Jamie Lynn br br Best wishes Ryan and Kara L,negative
Okay so Ive read most of the reviews on this movie as well as comments left by visitors to this site and the feeling I get is that most people who wrote reviews really didnt like this movie Thats why Im writing nowI represent the minority because I did I admit I went to see the movie because I am very impressed with Ryan Goslings compelling abilities and the projects he has been a part of lately have been nothing less than incredible He is an amazing actor That aside I wanted to see this movie because it seemed intriguing to me why Because its a whodunit where you know whodunit from the start and thats kind of unusualbr br As the plot goes two teenage boys endeavour to commit the perfect crime because they believe in a twisted philosophy that only through committing acts of crime are human beings truly freethe uninhibited and lets remember guiltless acting out of ones will The relationship between Richard and Justin was complex hinted at homosexuality and was brilliantly acted by Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt Gosling was the manipulating controlling smoothtalker and Pitt was the extremely booksmart socially awkward outcast Enter Sandra Bullocks character who it seems most people didnt particularly appreciate I think when people see she was the executive producer they automatically assume any role the actor has in it is a selfglorification thing I didnt see that as the case here Without Cassies personal history about the exhusband that nearly killed her who not surprisingly shared similar traits with Richard Hayward she never would have pursued her instincts about Justin and Richard The case was seemingly airtight against Ray the unsuspecting school janitor and friend of the boys Even when the boys are questioned near the end of the movie neither Bullock nor her partner have much solid evidence about them other than the fact that they lied about knowing each other and the vomit Justin left at the sight Therein lay the genius of the movie because the philosophy the boys were trying to prove through the act of killing the guiltless acting out of will as true freedom ended up working against Justin who ended up having a conscience after all and ended up leaving part of his conscience at the body dump site Without that crucial piece of evidence they almost had a murder by numbers And to readers out there who have puzzled over the title as much as I have I looked in to it and found that something done by numbers such as a painting suggests careful and critical planning and exacting Theres also a song by Sting called Murder By Numbers but thats beside the point br br Many readers questioned the necessity of the relationship between Cassie and her partner but I think it really meant to show how cynical and manipulative she had become because of her history Like it or not her history does play an important role in this movie because without it she would likely have never followed her instincts about Justin and Richard Yes it was a bit of the cliche women scorned woman acting out vendetta in every facet of her life plot but I think without the depth of Cassies character you have just another movie about teenage killers and they just may have gotten away with it Theres no movie therebr br And to the reader who commented that the teenagers obviously didnt commit the perfect crime because the police were on to them from the beginning can I remind you that the reason was because of the purposely placed and totally traceable shoe prints The boys wanted to be involvedit was a game They were so confident that they had committed the perfect crime that they wanted to see first hand the difficulty the investigators would have in uncovering what they think is the truth What they didnt expect was that Cassie Mayweather had an overactive case of instinct working on her side A little unbelievable Maybe But many crimes have been solved by police officers who have followed their instincts However this is a MOVIEbr br I saw this movie in theatres about three times and each time it revealed a little more to me and I liked it a little more The more I watched it the more I was captivated and frightened by the psychological depth Richard Haywardthere are people really like this My main complaint about the movie would be that they should have had Justin and Richards interactions a little more central because lets face it there lays the intrigue in the entire film and my main props go to characterizationeach character was very distinct and interesting in hisher own way It was very well acted although I would have given Ben Chaplins character a little more depth to work with hes a good actor and maybe pared down Bullocks character a smidgenbr br I think everyone should keep in mind that for a Hitchcock type thriller like this to basically tell you the whodunit at the beginning it poses a very big challenge for the writers to keep the attention of the audience until the very end I think they did so quite well by utilizing a few small plot twists throughout slow revelation of the different character dynamics and by lighting up the screen with some really emotionally charged performances by the young actors Ryan Gosling and Michael Pitt I think if we remove our innate cynicism and attempt to see how psychologically complex the characters and their interactions are we may be able to look beyond any apparent plot holes and see the real texture and quality of this movie if only in the characters who were brilliantly portrayed Especially Richard Hayward Not that Im biassed ,positive
This movie is not only about feelings and human emotions it is also about everything that could be but its not Poetry in movies can be awfully boring and annoying but this movie is delightful to be watched Not to mention the amazing Irène Jacob a great actress in France  one of the best actually When the movie ends you can only feel sorry After all when something is truly great we want more Well for another great movie by K Kieslowsky with Irène Jacob we can always watch La double vie de Veronique,positive

This is another one of those films that I remember staying up late to watch on TV scaring the crap out of myself at the impressionable age of 12 or so and dooming myself thereafter to a life of horror movie obsession This is a GREAT movie and stands as living proof that there were indeed realistic effects before CGIbr br Set on an isolated base in Antarctica this version seems almost to pick up where the original version The Thing From Another World left off The American scientists discover a decimated Norwegian base some miles distant Everyone is dead and only the half charred remains of some unidentifiable thing left to smolder outside the compound might offer any answers to what may have happened The Thing is brought back to the American base and too late the scientists realize that it is alive and lethal The Thing thaws out and is off not only killing anyone and anything that crosses Its path but also absorbing them making Itself into whoever and whatever it wants The film then turns into a brilliant paranoia piece Everyone is suspect anyone can be The Thing and no one trusts anyone anymore Gone is the strength and security found when human beings band together in spite of their differences to battle a monster The group splinters and fear rules supreme Who is the Thingbr br The gore effects here are absolutely amazing and messily realistic I could have done without the dogs head splitting open like a banana peel but thats just the animal lover in me being picky kill all the humans you want but leave the kitties and puppies alone Sanity and reason disintegrate rapidly as one by one the humans are taken over by the shapeshifting alien The power of this film lies in its paranoia and although I liked the original version I prefer this one the real threat lies within and is scarier for the fact that it cannot be seen or easily detected When it is forced out of hiding its wrath is huge and the results are horrificbr br This is one of Carpenters best films right up there with The Fog and Halloween All of the actors give strong realistic performances and the special effects are so powerful that they stand as their own main character This film has something for any lover of the horror genre Dont miss it,positive
I have seen nearly all the films of Kurosawa and dozens of other Japanese films as well Compared to these other films this is a rather average to poor film The plot features two warring brothersneither one of which I cared much forand it is very confusing keeping up with who is allied with who The music and cinematography is pretty good but the special effects at times are terriblerubber heads flying off with about the same realism as the average high school play On top of these complaints the ending of the movie completely DESTROYS and UNDERMINES the entire picture It turns out that the end isnt true but was completely fudged Whats the point of this then If you HAVE seen this film understand that there are MANY better films out there so dont give up,negative
The movie is okay it has its moments the music scenes are the best of all The soundtrack is a true classic Its a perfect album it starts out with Lets Go Crazyappropriate for the beginning as its a great party song and very uptempo Take Me With Ua fun pop song The Beautiful Onesa cheerful ballad probably the closest thing to RB on this whole album Computer Bluea somewhat angry anthem towards Appolonia Darling Nikkione of the funniest songs ever it very vaguely makes fun of Appolonia When Doves Crythe climax to this masterpiece I Would Die 4 U Baby Im A Star and of course Purple Raina true classic a very appropriate ending for this classic album The movie and the album are both very good I highly recommend them,positive
Special sneak previews are always a good time No matter what movie it is you are seeing the theatre will always be packed by people who have been awaiting the film like free stuff thought itd be something to do or just got lost Either way no matter how good or bad the film the audience alone will make it enjoyable Now when said movie is a PG13 pseudo horror film can you really delve into horror when the MPAA is on your back censoring everything you know there will be chatter laughing and breath holding With The Messengers the crowd did not disappoint giving numerous outbursts and warnings to the characters on screen As for the actual movie I feel sorry for those involved because it really could have been much better had it been paced right and allowed to stretch its legs beyond the scarefadetoblackshow aftermath progression these films have In the end we are shown a boring plodding story with no surprises and few moments of actual suspensebr br The story is a common one A family moves from the big city to the country after a traumatic event to try and rebuild their relationship with each other Once settled in the spirits of the house come out to the reformed troublemaker child whose past makes it even easier for the parents to disbelieve everything told to them Of course the child is not crying wolf and those around only find out when it is too late I will credit the Pang Brothers directors of the acclaimed The Eye that I would like to watch more than before to see what they can do without Hollywood interferencesupposedly reshoots on The Messengers were done by someone else but the brothers retained credit its a shame what our studio system does to foreigners especially when it was creative independence which made the films that brings them in and not bottomline interference for really having a fitting style and for keeping the tired plot line somewhat fresh Unfortunately though I also must give them credit for the almost unbearable slowness Similar to why I disliked What Lies Beneath I couldnt stand the drawn out suspense which goes so far as to make it laughable When our heroine and her brother stand in a hallway with a ghost behind them the scene lasts about eight minutes with just static oddly composed closeups and depth of field focus changes to end up culminating to absolutely nothing For being only 84 minutes I almost think it would have worked better even shorterbr br Besides a very effective opening sequence featuring the fantastic Jodelle Ferland strangely playing a boy and a great atmospheric credit sequence the only thing that saves the film from utter garbage is the acting Except for Penelope Ann Miller who first made me wonder what ever happened to her and then after a few scenes made me understand why I never asked that question in the years she was absent and Dustin Milligan completely lacking in credibility the acting is very strong Dyan McDermott does a nice job as the father trying to keep his family together through all the tough times He has many little moments of light comedy to counteract his serious dramatic role William B Davis everyones favorite Cancerman is used effectively as an almost foreboding character sadly not utilized more Our true stars are Kristen Stewart and John Corbett Stewart plays the emotion very well and shows some promise as an actress with this and Panic Room on her resume As for Corbett if he didnt pull off his role the entire movie would have unraveled completely I do wish he would be given more work as Ive enjoyed him since the underappreciated series The VisitorI still need to check out his first role in Northern Exposure a show I havent yet been able to catch up on Its a shame he will probably be most recognizable for the overrated My Big Fat Greek Weddingbr br If anything The Messengers gave me a nice introduction to the Pang Brothers work and reinvigorated my desire to check out their Chinese horror catalog The mood and performances were there it was just the simple and vacant story that needed way too much padding to make a feature film If they delved more into other characters rather than just Stewarts it could have been more effective while also having something more to show then ten minute scenes of nothing If our protagonist is the only one being attacked there is no suspense as to how far the creatures will go to harm her The moments of danger had no gravity to them and until the ending really just stood in as filler I am excited however for the free comic book given away after the special screening as hopefully the medium will allow for a faster paced story that engrosses before it tries to surprise,negative

Significant Spoilers br br This is a sick disturbing movie just like the sick twisted director Jennifer Chambers Lynch who also wrote it I dont even know why I gave this movie a rating of 2 It is not the fault of the actors for sure The cast certainly portrayed their roles well It is the way this movie was written and the way the characters were written which was the benchmark of a truly sick mindbr br I do know that I will never ever watch another movie which has been written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch She is a sick twisted foulmouthed foulthinking deviant She looks speaks and sounds like some biker chick with her brain fried on drugs who spent 20 years doing hard time You can clearly see what kind of person she is by watching her on the DVD special features section of Surveillance The Watched are Watching You can see and hear her for yourself She was every bit as bad as I had envisioned from the writing of this moviebr br Im not shocked by bad language although this director certainly talks like a sailor This goes far beyond simple bad language worse than any p0rn film The level of implied sadoviolence and perversion she incorporates into every character she writes are of the genre which is even illegal by p0rn standards This perverse disturbing thinking is clearly apparent in her own personality and things she says Another reviewer found the description I was seeking This is a snuff filmbr br Be sure to listen to her narration on the deleted scenes and alternate ending This directorwriter is truly a sick person I cant believe anyone would put her in charge of a movie much less pay her for it You can be assured that I will never ever watch another movie she has been affiliated with In the thousands of movies I have watched and collected there are only a couple directors and writers which have merited this kind of boycott She is offensive beyond anyone I have ever seen connected with filming a movie before There have been some bad directors and writers but none could compare to her sick twisted mindbr br When I saw this movie which was just one murder rampage after another Once it got past the hotel murder then the sick cops shooting at and brutalizing drivers for kicks the vacation family with the bad parents who had no business being in the presence of children followed by the drug addicts the movie then proceeded to the even more twisted deviant serial killersbr br As I saw the serial killers reveal themselves I began to wonder what kind of truly sick mind wrote this movie Those were my actual thoughts as I watched this movie I fully intended to find out what writer had such a sick mind because that writer seriously needs to be committed for longterm psychiatric treatment To my surprise it turned out to be the director When I saw and heard what she had to say on the DVD I realized my assessment of the writer was right on the nose On the DVD she was indeed the sick twisted person I had envisioned writing such a disturbing filmbr br While the little girl Stephanie Ryan Simpkins truly stole the show I cant believe that her reallife parents would have tolerated this sick foulmouthed director to be anywhere near their daughterbr br This movie is disturbing sick offensive twisted and the directorwriter needs some serious treatment in a mental facilitybr br As far as the ending of the movie goes the alternate ending should have been the outcome of this horrific ordeal There was no point and no benefit to the film or the story or the flow of the film by the death of the other character Im stunned that any studio actually distributed the movie The trailer was completely misleading The only reason the movie got the audience it did was due to the clever wordsmithing and creative depiction on the trailer That trailer is not representative of the movie you will seebr br Other than the child every character in this movie was a sick murderous twisted perverse violent sex freak and their characters are mirrored the mind of the writerdirector who created them But if you watch it carefully even the parents of the vacationing family the sick cops taking pot shots the serial killers posing in alternate roles cops in the station and even the station dispatcher every single one of these character roles incorporated a sexually twisted violent pervert Im not too sure about some of the actors after watching them talk about the filming of the movie and the Canadian town in the Special Features section of the DVDbr br This writerdirector has such a personal mental deviation that no matter what she writes every character role contains those same carbon copy stamps The only character which did not have these deviant tendencies was the child Watch closely and you will see this in every character Then listen to the directorwriter talk on the DVD Special Features section and you will understand what Im telling you about her mental state and psychological issues She wouldnt be tolerated in too many decent homes if she were not from a Hollywood film making familybr br Fortunately Jennifer Chambers Lynch does not have much of a filmography less than a handful of things Since she carbon copies those disturbing traits in all of her character roles I dont think well have to see many movies written or directed by her unless her dad director David Lynch helps her out Id recommend staying away from any movie she is involved with and Im not too sure her dads films would be any betterbr br Do yourself a favor Avoid anything written or directed by Jennifer Chambers Lynch,negative

If my memory is correct when this movie was released it came across as something of a comedy  a funny look at the adult entertainment industry If thats what its supposed to be it doesnt really work It just isnt that funny Setting that rather significant since this is called a comedy failure aside since I have no personal knowledge of the subject matter Ill avoid comment about the authenticity of the story  which deals with the goings on behind the scenes in a Toronto massage parlour except to say that  if this is true  the life is pretty dull br br For over an hour this movie really doesnt give us much of anything except some background knowledge of the main characters Conrad is the newly hired manager of the massage parlour whose basic job apparently is to make sure the girls arent giving full service  a euphemism for actual sex As for the girls themselves Bettys goal is to buy a parlour of her own so that she can run her own business Cindy is an illegal immigrant to Canada working to support her family back home and Leah is  well Leah is a somewhat strange undefined character with a nipple fetish  true  who seems to be in the business because  well because shes in it I have no idea what her character was about Those three may well fairly reasonable composite characters who accurately represent the motivations of the women who get involved in this businessbr br The movie meanders about and doesnt offer much until the twist reveals Conrad to be the bad guy We should have gotten to that point sooner The only thing truly interesting here was that part of the story  Conrads secret plan and the revenge plotted against him by the girls That plan for revenge was pretty good and youre grateful when it comes out because basically up to that point youre wondering why you wasted your time with this Had the story been more focused on the revenge this might have actually been a fairly funny moviebr br The performances from the 4 leads were all OK although I didnt think anyone came across as outstanding All four characters were a bit shallow Cindy was a sympathetic character and so was Conrad for a while although he turns out to be the bad guy of the movie Given the subject matter theres surprisingly little nudity and what there is is restricted to one scene In fact there even a certain air of innocence around a lot of this As for the overall quality of the movie its a lowbudget effort which shows although you expect a certain griminess I suppose of a movie set in the context of a body rub parlour so thats forgivable It certainly says something though that this was released 8 years ago now and is still the only credit on writerdirector Soo Lyus resume and  given the normal lack of depth in the Canadian film industry  that it wasnt even deemed worthy of being nominated for any Genie Awards  the Canadian version of the Oscars 410  and Im being a bit generous with that,negative

Watching the commercials for this movie I was fairly convinced that I was going to loathe it For one thing it was one of those loosely based on the novel movies which usually means that the book author saw the script hated it and refused to be associated with the film Worse the trailer showed only the most mundane slapstick imaginable ex kid gets squirted in the face with a garden hoseand falls over So when my little brother got it into his mind that this was the must see film of the season of course he thought the same thing about Cars Over the Hedge The Ant Bully Monster House etc etc I was admittedly less than thrilledbr br But once at the theater the film won me over for a variety of reasons First and foremost the writers capture kid dialogue better than just about any other childrens film Ive ever seen A prime example of this comes directly after the boys principal accidentally eats a worm stuck in an egg omelet The boys do a lame overexaggerated impression of the principal lecturing them which makes it realistic since all little kids think mistakenly that they do great mocking expressions of their adult tormentors Then one of the boys asks Why did he say alley oop Another boy responds Maybe hes crazy and the entire group laughs uproariously Not an overly witty rejoinder but exactly the kind of thing a young kid would come up with on the spot and exactly the type of remark other kids his age would find hilarious As if to confirm it my kid brother laughed right on cue when they were spoken onscreen I could practically hear his voice spouting the same exact lines if he was placed in a similar situationbr br Another reason the movie works is that the writers manage to work in issues like bullying sibling relationships the new kid in school and peer pressureconformity without making any of them seem as though they were subplots for some after school special For example the bully Joe isnt stereotypical hes definitely bad but not pure evil and just enough of his homelife is revealed that the audience feels sympathy for him and understands his bullying origins Theres also no cue the dramatic music moment where Billy Worm Boy realizes what a complete tool hes being to his younger brother Woody and yet by the end of the movie some type of minor transformation has been made Theres some realism here in the way the characters resolve situations and in the way they relate to each other and very little of it comes across as cornybr br The only drawback to the movie comes in the form of an absolutely laughable dance scene that even the creators of the infamous McDonalds dance party in Mac and Me would scoff at Why oh why was it put into the movie Did Austin Rogers Adam pull a Macaulay Culkin and refuse to take the role unless he was given a vehicle to showcase his oh so impressive dancing skills The entire sequence definitely did not need to be there and had slightly less comedic value than any given show on The History Channelbr br Overall though this movie was excellent and the length about an hour and twenty minutes was just about perfect One of the best most realistic live action kid films youll ever see if youre ever around children or just remember what being a kid was actually like,positive

this movie has been done when Hitler  and Mussolini who is as well in the movie was at the top and many politics and even the Roman Church used to close eyes about brutality and evil of Nazism Especially in USA there were many people who had not understood what was really going on in Germany and Europe  Charles Lindenbergh for example It would be as today a big actor would made a parody of Berlusconi or Chirac Chaplin maybe made a lot of mistakes in his life but this is really a masterpiece of humanity and IMHO a great demonstration he was a courageous man The movie is funny and deep the final speech has a terrible strength and is still updated I think this movie is one of the best ever done,positive

This is one of the best of the early Star Trek episodes with Kirk and his crew venturing into the unknown to do battle with an enemy known only by name Imagine their surprise when they find out that the dreaded Romulans are racial offshoots of the Vulcans Young Mr Stiles wellplayed by Paul Comi is one of the few truly unlikable characters in the Star Trek universe His barely disguised hatred of Mr Spock is eerily similar to the post911 hatred and suspicion many Americans have of people of Arab or Middle Eastern origin The atmosphere of wartime paranoia is all too real Then theres the Romulans theyre the ultimate Federation nemesis The Klingons are nasty but basically harmless more of a nuisance than a serious threat The Romulans however mean business theyre the ancient Romans reborn in the space age in spite of their Vulcanoid features theyre clearly meant to remind us of imperial Rome with names like Decius and titles like centurion and praetor The chainmail armor is really cool Familiar guest star Mark Lenard who went on to play Spocks dad Sorek as well as the Klingon commander in Star Trek the Motion Picture is an appropriately grizzled warweary commander a character who bears a striking resemblance to Laurence Oliviers Crassus in Spartacus Also his questioning of the Empires unquenchable thirst for conquest reminds me of the similar misgivings Marcus Aurelius Richard Harris expressed at the beginning of Gladiator A must both for Trekkies and swordandsandal epic fans,positive
OK If youre looking for another Bastketball Diaries this is completely the wrong filmbr br I revolves around two brothers Max the younger has a major cocaine addiction Adam the eldest is a doctor This movie is suppose to show the plunge from reality to the extreme lows that drugs make possible It however does not It shows that cocaine can be fun no matter what the situation happens to be present Most of the movie focus is on Max and his parting ways Eventually Adam can no longer take the stress from his job and begins to use as well perscription drugsbr br This movie has almost no climax Doesnt descend into what cocaine really does to you has boring and lowbudget scenes and the acting of the eldest brother Adam is horrificbr br I have no idea how this movie has managed to pass and receive awards it is not a heartwencher If you want a clear and true story movie on the extreme world of drugs rent if not buy The Basketball Diaries And notice the differencebr br Try to avoid this movie but if you think you will enjoy Try and see for yourself,negative
I come to Pinjar from a completely different background than most of the other reviewers who have posted here Im relatively new to Bollywood films and was born and raised in the US So I dont have a broad basis for comparing Pinjar to other Indian films Luckily no comparison is neededbr br Pinjar stands on its own as nothing less than a masterpiecebr br In one line I can tell you that Pinjar is one of the most important films to come out of any studio anywhere at any time On a massappeal scale it could have been the Indian equivalent of Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon had it been adequately promoted in the US This could very well have been the film that put Bollywood on the American map The American moviegoing public has a longstanding love affair with Gone With the Wind and while Pinjar doesnt borrow from that plot there are some passing similarities Not the least of which is the whopping by US standards 183minute run timebr br Set against the gritty backdrop of the IndiaPakistan partition in 194748 is a compelling human drama of a young woman imprisoned by circumstances and thrust into troubles she had no hand in creating Put into an untenable position she somehow manages to not only survive but to grow  and even flourishbr br If the story is lacking in any way its in the exposition Puros the protagonist growth as a person would be better illustrated  at least for western audiences unfamiliar with Indian culture  if her characters back story were more fully developed in the early part of the film But that would have stretched a 3hour movie to 3 12 hours or perhaps even more Because not one minute of the film is wasted and none of what made it out of editing could really be cut for the sake of time Better that the audience has to fill in some of what came before than to leave out any of what remainsbr br I could use many words to describe Pinjar poignant disturbing compelling heartwrenching come to mind immediately But uplifting is perhaps as apropos as any of those Any story that points up the indomitability of the human spirit against the worst of odds has to be considered such And Puros triumph  while possibly not immediately evident to those around her  is no less than inspirational For strength of story alone I cannot recommend this film highly enoughbr br Equally inspiring is Urmila Matondkars portrayal of Puro All too often overlooked amid the bevy of younger newer actresses Urmila has the unique capability to deliver a completely credible character in any role she plays She doesnt merely act Puros part she breathes life into the character Manoj Bajpais selection as Rashid was inspired He manages something far too few Indian film heroes can subtlety His command of expression and nuance is essential to the role He brings more menace to the early part of the film with his piercing stare than all of the swordwielding rioters combinedbr br If you only see one Bollywood film in your life make it Pinjar,positive
While it comes no closer to the Tarzan of Edgar Rice Burroughs than say the Johnny Wiesmuller flicks did it does have its own peculiar and entertaining slant on the story Its a well done Tarzan movie Nice scenery good photography workable continuity and a Tarzan yell that echos the one described by Burroughs The players all perform well The only bad points I found were I think related It moves slow in places That slow movement Makes this picture to long It could easily have been 15 to 20 minutes shorter which I think would have helped with the natural flow of the plot line and the character development But the rest of the film works well enough to carry it over these two rough spots and still leave the viewer satisfied with the flick Short version of all the above  Its a very GOOD Tarzan movie,positive
Colleges High Schools Fraternities and Sororities have been the most popular stalking grounds for maniacal madmen since the slasher cycle first became a popular cinema culture throughout the late seventies Even backwoods cabins and campsites have rode shotgun to the amount of massacres that have taken place on campuses since Halloween categorised the genre as a cult horror category From early entries like To all a Good Night right up until the big budgeted schlock of titles like Urban Legend or Schools Out theres usually always been a campus slasher lurking somewhere in the pipeline Despite being picked up by Troma  the titans of B movie badness  Splatter University was heavily panned upon release and never really found an audience Even notorious hack and slash websites like HYSTERIALIVES have written off Richard Haines splatter yarn as one of the worst of the early eighties boom I always approach criticised movies optimistically because theres often the chance than a few bad reviews can be unfairly contagious like a dose of the flu which crowds the judgement of certain authorsbr br It begins in traditional fashion at the place where any maniac worth his salts emerges Yep you guessed it  an insane asylum It seems that one of the inmates has decided that hes unhappy with the level of service at the institution and therefore hes looking to take his business elsewhere The unseen nutjob makes his break after stabbing an unfortunate orderly where the sun certainly doesnt shine He obviously favours the dress sense of the murdered worker so he takes the liberty of borrowing his uniform blood stained trousers and allbr br Three years later we transfer to St Trinians College an educational establishment that is controlled by catholic priests A teacher is busy after hours marking her students work when all of a sudden theres a knock at the door Before she has a chance to find out what the unseen visitor wants he stabs her in the chest with a kitchen knife and she falls to the floor in a bloody heap This of course means that theres a vacancy at the university and so were introduced to Julie Parker Francine Forbes the lovable replacement for the recently departed lecturer It seems that her arrival has inadvertently given the resident maniac all the motivation that he needs to go on a no holds barred slaughterthon Before long students and teachers alike are dropping like flies to the camera shy menace as he stalks the corridors and local areas armed with an exceptionally large blade Suspicious suspects abound but can professor Parker solve the mystery of the campus murderer before she becomes just another statistic br br Im not precisely sure how many versions of this movie are available The UK altered video was released under the alias of Campus Killings but the US copy that I own states that its the complete unedited edition which could mean that there is a censored print floating about somewhere Id be fairly surprised if that was the case as Splatter University certainly isnt as goredelicious as the hyperbole packaging would lead you to believe One or two litres of corn syrup certainly dont stand up to gore hounds scrutiny when compared to the likes of Blood Rage or Pieces so in this instance the movie is somewhat over hyped One thing that many critics have failed to mention is the charming lead performance from Francine Forbes who ends up carrying the entire picture on her shoulders throughout the 79minute running time Despite amateurish direction from Richard Haines she still unveils some magnificent potential that should have lead to the chance of another stab at serious acting under a more accomplished helmer Unfortunately that possibility never came and bottom of the barrel bombs like Death Ring and Splitz certainly didnt help to nurture a talent that could have improved dramatically under the right scholarshipbr br The rest of the cast members were par for the course of movie obscurity especially the wooden plank teenagers who for some strange reason acted like they were auditioning for a remake of Grease or The Wanderers The bog standard point and shoot direction couldnt have helped to build much confidence in the project and the fact that the few signs of potential were undermined by the clumsy handling of the script writer left the feature effectively unredeemable Perhaps the only claim of originality to be found in Haines slasher is the brave attempt for the contrasting conclusion Lets just say that its not a final that I was expecting to witness in a movie that was so typical of the cyclebr br At one point in the runtime one of the teens says Man that Parker bores me to tears Well the same can be said for Splatter University which never lifts the pace above slow motion With that said though Francine Forbes made for a delectable scream queen and undoubtedly one that I would have paid to watch again in a similar role So that pretty much sums up this untromatising ride Slow paced shoddy but still strangely alluring youd have to be especially forgiving to give it a chance,negative
This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen For me thats what makes it so awesome Fred Gwynne and Al Lewis are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series While there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together comedically I wish Yvonne De Carlo as Lily would have had more plot involvement She showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie This movie also stars the great Sid Caesar but sadly he doesnt have any interaction with Gwynne and Lewis I think some better work could have come out of that,positive
Imagine pulling back the mask of a lethal assassin and finding Barbara Cartland there thats what happens with this filmbr br The opening showed promise but soon it drops all pretenses of being a thriller or even an imaginative love story and the only reason they made this story becomes abundantly clear to fill a gap in their female viewing market by creating yet another rehash of misunderstood brooding badboy Andrei meets innocent whimsical beauty Paula br br Rather than waste any time in creating an original premise the filmmakers went straight for the moneyshot the bad boy being tamed by said whimsical beauty Thence follows a string of insincere and heavilyclichéd love scenes sprinkled with pseudo philosophicalpoetic fluff Andreis admission of being eponymously a poet is levered in to round out the perceived qualities a Byronic hero should have  but even when were told in heavy underlined writing who and what he is its still difficult to believe it  or carebr br For a Byronic heroantihero to work the story needs subtlety style and innovation  all of which are utterly absent here This is not a modern day Phantom of the Opera its just what happens when a weak and rather silly woman with loose knicker elastic dates a bad man who after meeting her seems as dangerous as bunny slippersbr br The performances might have saved this film had they been any good the female lead is preoccupied with looking sexy and otherworldly no matter how forced or ridiculous and poor Dougray Scott appears to have been drugged as he shambles through his part This is not his best work The glimmers of interest were brought by Jürgen Prochnow as Vashon and Andrew Lee Potts as the young photographerbrother A better movie would have offed the sister and kept the brother instead,negative
Hmm is it right to compare Tiffani Thiessen and MarkPaul Gosselaars post Saved By The Bell acting Of course its not right its ridiculous And is right to give this movie a 10 rating Hahahahahaha thats funny This movie wasnt so horrible though better than I expected it to be MadeforTV movies are often so so so similar So many of them have the same feel to them This one had that same feel but it worked even though it was yet another tortured wife whos gotta get the bstard in the end story Before it started I had envisioned Ms Thiessen as a vixen type 90210 seductress but here she was as innocent as Kelly Kapowski which was refreshing Eric Close surprised me by playing his part really well With some decent writing the director got a pretty good convincing performance out of him without being at all cheesy All in all it was somewhat interesting definitely better than most TV movies My grade B,positive
His significant charisma and commanding presence are about all that keep this afloat but Fred Williamson has done far better urban action films including many of his later vidreleased fare The big studios Williamson films of the earlytomid 70s rarely had the punch of their midlevel counterparts and this is a prime example Clumsy action little violence and the PG rating is nowhere near questionable Worth a look for Hammer completists in any case,negative
A great performance by Clint Eastwood and particularly John Malkovich in my opinion his finest one to date Malkovich had this one nailed right down to the floor its incredible Eastwood is Agent Mike Horrigan an aged and cynical Secret Service Agent who is finishing out his career busting counterfeiters and chasing down routine assignments But one assignment which appears to be run of the mill at first turns complicated and deadly serious Horrigan and his new partner Al are sent to investigate a threat on the President by a wacko As fate would have it Horrigan has stumbled not upon a delusional nut but a professional lone wolf who has a big bone to pick with the White House As Horrigan dives deeper into Booths world he attracts the bad guys unwanted attention and unbridled admiration for him Horrigan was JFKs top agent and present in Dallas Texas when he was assassinated and blames himself for what happened Now he feels its up to him to stop the current Head of State from joining the list of dead Presidents But this killer has turned the tables on Horrigan and now hes the hunted one in a life or death cat and mouse game Who will win Who will die Its a race against time to save the Pres from a chameleonlike enemy who can get to anyone My favorite Secret Service movie and as good a nail biter as any,positive
I saw this film while I was in France and I must say that it confused me It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in Morocco at the same time run into one another and form a connection Simple enough Well the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology the film is not played entirely in order and in reality did what i just saw really happen or was it only a dream Given those parameters as well as the film being bilingual it was really hard to follow and I was not sure as to what happened at the end I imagine some deep artsy types could understand this film better than I could and it may require more than one viewing to understand,negative
This movie took me by surprise The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation After that were plunged into a semicheesy production betraying its low budget The characters typical American teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this By the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities Its a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster Thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school HORROR Steve Johnsons makeup effects are awesome Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films And the scares are jolting Kevin Tenney delivers his best movie ever with heartstopping surprises and creepy suspenseful setups The tongueincheek sometimes cheesy humor marks this film as pure 80s horror as opposed to the sullen tone of earlier genre fare like Night of the Living Dead or Hills Have Eyes But for true horror fans this one is worth checking out Play it as the first entry on a double bill with the 1999 remake of House on the Haunted Hill The setup and character dynamics are so similar that you really have to wonder what film they were actually remaking,positive
It may not have had the big budgets celebrities or endorsements of Scream Urban Legend or I Know What You Did Last Summer but Campfire Tales had one thing these three movies lacked true horrorbr br This film tackled the subject of urban legends a year before the aptly titled and less than enthralling Urban Legend did It was intriguing masterfully scripted and logical in a way I Know What You Did Last Summer could only dream of Finally it held its focus and finished with a flurry while Scream fizzled and diedbr br Whats most exciting about the film is the variety of horror that the writers and directors achieved The overarching story of teenagers around a campfire was classic dread at the unknown but certainly expected doom that awaited them in the forest but the tales themselves are where the movie really shinedbr br The opening sequence is pure fastpaced urban myth Its based on a popular legend and the director plays on this with the style and pace of the action making it more enthralling because we know whats going to happenbr br The first campfire tale is a straightforward thriller Based on another popular myth we dont actually realize this until the end both because it blends so well into the story and because the action keeps our attention Being the thriller of the trilogy this one plays off our fear of the unknown and includes several welldone jump sequences that dont feel nearly as cheap or contrite as those in movies like Scream or Urban Legendbr br The second tale is more suspense This time though the characters still dont know whats going on we do and this provides the horror No need for cheap thrills herebr br The final tale contains elements of the supernatural and uses a creepytrippy atmosphere to scare the viewer Because we can relate so easily to the characters and their situation our fear comes from their intensity and what they cant explain This is the true ghost story of the triobr br I didnt expect to enjoy Campfire Tales when I rented it I figured that if I didnt like its more acclaimed biggerbudget counterparts how could I like itbr br The truth is though this film succeeds where the others fell far short of the mark,positive

I LOVE this movie Director Michael Powell once stated that this was his favorite movie and it is mine as well Powell and Pressburger created a seemingly simple superbly crafted story  the power of love against the powers that be However its deception lies in the complexity of its is it real or is it imaginary premise Basically one could argue that it is simply a depiction of the effects of war on a young poetically inclined airman during WWII Or is it The question is never answered one way or the other Actually it is never even asked This continuous understatement is part of the films appealbr br The innovative photography and cinematography even includes some nice touches portraying the interests of the filmmakers For instance Pressburger always wanted to do a cinematic version of Richard Strauss opera Der Rosenkavalier about a young 18th century Viennese aristocrat This is evident in the brief interlude in which Conductor 71 dressed in all his finery holds the rose which appears silver in heaven The music even has a dreamy qualitybr br All of the acting is first rate  David Niven is at his most charming and he has excellent support from veteran Roger Livesey and relative newcomer Kim Hunter But in my opinion the films charm comes from Marius Goring as Conductor 71 He by far has the most interesting role filling each of his scenes with his innocent lightheartedness brightening the film Its a pity that some of Conductor 71s scenes were left on the cutting room floor It is also a pity that Gorings comedic talents are rarely seen again on film except in the wonderful videos of The Scarlet Pimpernel television series from the 1950s This is by far and away the most memorable role of his film career He is a perfect foil for relaxed style of Niven and his virtual overstatement contrasts so nicely with the seriousness of the rest of the characters Ironically also in the mid 1940s Niven also starred against another heavenly messenger played by Cary Grant in The Bishops Wife Their acting styles were so similar that I found the result boring unenergetic and disappointing As a note according to Powell Goring desperately wanted the role of Peter Carter initially refusing Conductor 71 Its a good thing he gave in and gave us such a delightful portrayalbr br The movie commissioned to smooth over the strained relations between Britain and the US overdrives its point towards the end But it is disarming in its gentle reminders of the horrors of war  the numerous casualties both military and civilian the need to go on when faced with death There is a conspicuous lack of WWII enemies in heaven but the civilians shown are of indeterminate origin Powell and Pressburger could have been more explicit in their depiction but it wasnt necessary The movie may not have served its diplomatic purpose as was hoped for but its originality continues to inspire moviemakers and viewers alike on both sides of the Atlantic,positive

Chupacabra Dark Waters has to rank as one of the most insipidly moronic movies ever made I had expected at least some passable entertainment because John Rhys Davies was involved and after seeing this movie I can honestly say I lowered my opinion of Mr Davies substantiallybr br Why The acting is incredibly poor An excellent actor like Davies should have demanded more from the cast and the director It was painfully obvious that Mr Davies was just clockwatching and hoping the check would not bounce To say that he just showed up would be an understatement But at least he did show up The rest of the cast looks like they mailed it in from their respective jobs at the various Los Angeles restaurants where they work as waiters Talk about a cast of unknowns This is the kind of cast that never appears in movies again They act as if they were auditioned while waiting at the unemployment officebr br What about the special effects Store bought firecrackers Styrofoam a cheap rubber suit and CGI effects that look like they came from my 1980 Atari Game I have seen some horrible special effects used on SciFi Channel movies but this stuff looked like cutandpaste done at the kindergarten by someones child I expected Mr Crabs and SpongeBob would show up at the end to battle the Chupacabra Not to mention that all the accounts of the creature describe it as a small gremlinlike critter It would have been a good film for a Leprechaunlike character Instead we get a gigantic hulking creature that is shown walking with stopaction speededup effects that are laughable The chupacabra is in one place and then it shuffles at superspeed down the hall and it is worth a few laughs just to see this,negative

Im not sure why Spike Lee made this train wreck of a movie and conned poor Stevie Wonder into eternally pairing his beautiful music with this theatrical mess I also resent the way he uses profanity as a part of the normal prose of professional Blacks The abuse of his hold on ethnic movie goers is a shame Scenes which seem to be contrived out the blue and have nothing to do with the theme or sub themes play as if some college kid wrote this I especially detest the ludicrous scene where the two leads are playfully sparring for no reason at all and the cops come and rough up Snipes The overacting of the leads makes one feel as if Spike has no respect for his viewers or he has no clue what a movie is all about The final scene appears to be thrown in to justify the use of a sledge hammer to tack a point in This movie also supports the myth that all people of culture use the Fword in casual conversation I am hoping he will realize that the rest of his movies are in the same pool as this one where he is not growing as a film maker I think his union with Scorcesee in Clockers was a wise move He should stick to making documentaries like the Four Little Colored Girls Shock movies do not an Oscar make,negative
How To Lose Friends  Alienate People is not based on Tiger Woods infidelities It is a mediocre romantic comedy based on Toby Youngs book on his experiences working as a journalist covering celebrities The film stars Simon Pegg as Sidney Young a zany British journalist who takes a job in an illustrious celebrity magazine in New York Young is restless in getting caught up all type of shenanigans to alienate all around him hence movie title He is uproarious daring and moronic But nevertheless for some very bizarre reason he is a somewhat likable character Sidney befriends a fellow journalist the composed Alison Olsen played quite admirably by Kirsten Dunst However Sidney is primarily longing for the sexpot actress Sophie Maes played by the Fantastic Ms Megan Fox This foxtrot is short on acting proficiency but high on eye candy material Sidney gets in all kinds of tomfoolery in order to move up the journalist ladder in the magazine co Those are the peak comedic moments of the film However I think that Director Robert Weide and Screenwriter Peter Straughan might lose some viewers and alienated authentic romcom material by developing an implausible romantic plot line between Sidney  Alison even though Team Weidstraughan did formulate an entertaining narrative otherwise Pegg did peg his character down to the wire with his hilarious performance as Sidney Young Jeff Bridges was again building The Dude bridges with his enigmatic supporting work as Clayton Harding the magazines suave prez But the rest of the films acting was not worthy enough to feature here How To Lose Friends  Alienate People should not be alienated entirely but you might lose some movie friends if you publicize it as a superlative romantic comedy  Average,positive
In The Line of Fire gives us a great game of cat and mouse Clint Eastwood is plagued by John Malkovich in this riveting film Malkovich says hes going to kill the president and he purposely calls Eastwood and pushes his buttons He questions Eastwoods ability to protect someone Malkovich brings a cold but very intelligent mindset to his character Everything he does he does for a reason and hes not shy about killing Eastwood has to overcome the suspicions of his superiors in order to catch Malkovich but no one wants to listen to him The result is a film that crackles with suspense that escalates to a tense scene in a ballroom at the Bonneventure Hotel Wolfgang Peterson ratchets up the tension and we feel every turn,positive
Is it a poorly acted clicheridden pile of trash Of course Anyone who doesnt realize that when they pick up the box in the video store probably doesnt have any right judging movies in the first place Thus I will now rate the aspects of the film that we actually care about on a scale of 1 to 10br br Violence and gore 4  For this genre there are very few deaths and the gore is almost nonexistent Anyone looking for a little blood should probably look elsewhere The only redeeming quality is the fact that kids are doing these awful things which raises the bar a littlebr br Suspense 1  Okay I feel bad for anyone who gets scared by this trio of dorky looking kidsbr br Nuditysex 7  Lots of boobage from three different women one of whom is the MTV vj Julie Brown There are two sex scenes but little is shown in thembr br Unintentional humor  4  There are a few good laughs with the kids trying to act scary but all in all its just bad not funny badbr br Overall  4  Its not unwatchable There are a few fun moments and enough nudity to keep your attention for the entire movie However only watch this movie if youre a big fan of the 80s slasher flicks This definitely falls on the lower end of the scale but its not all the way at the bottom The real downside is the disappointing ending It almost ruined the movie for me,negative
THE ASCENT is a very worthwhile addition to recent rereleases from the Soviet Union Director Larisa Shepitkos 1977 film examines the moral ramifications of allegiance and honor in German occupied Russia during The Second World War On foot and in a blizzard two members of a partisan Soviet group leave to locate supplies and are captured by Nazi soldiers The focus of the movie is on how each man handles or internalizes his moral alternatives One chooses dignity and integrity while the other opts for collaboration with the enemy However in the end he cannot abide by his selfish decision The film makes much use of slow wideangle pans which shift to extreme closeups and highlight the spiritual quandary within the souls of each man This is not a great film but it does effectively portray an intense moral dilemma against the backdrop of a harsh and frigid Soviet wilderness,positive

Godard once said a way to criticize a movie is to just make one and probably the strongest kind that could be made about Ralph Bakshis take on Tolkiens magnum opus the Lord of the Rings has actually been made by Peter Jackson The recent trilogy to me arent even total masterpieces but they are given enough room with each book to breath in all the postmodern techniques crossed with classical storytelling to make them very good sweeping entertainments br br But as one who has not read the books I end up now looking upon the two versions liveaction albeit partly animated in its big visual effects way and animated albeit partly done with actual live action as the framework in relation to just the basic story not even complete faithfulness to the books And with Bakshis version its almost not fair in a way as what we do see is really not the complete vision not what Jackson really had probably final cut Robbed of Return of the Kings big climactic rush of the story and with the other two parts becoming rushed I ended up liking it more for what it did within its limitations though as such those same limitations make it disappointingbr br Whats interesting too after seeing the Jackson films first which I also slightly regret being that I mightve reacted to this differently when I was younger and prior to five years ago is that the basic elements of the story never get messed up with Everything that is really needed to tell the Fellowship of the Ring story is actually pretty much intact and if anything what was probably even more gigantic and epic in Tolkiens book is given some clarity in this section The actors playing the parts of the hobbits and the other heroes are more or less adequate for the parts with a few parts standing out John Hurt as Aragorn and William Squire as Gandalf br br The lack of extra characterization does end up making things seem a little facevalue for those whove not even seen the other films or read the books and cant put them into context But there is some level of interest always with the characters and here theres a more oldfashioned sensibility amid the large aura of it being more This is not a garden variety Disney adaptation warts and all this is a Bakshi film with his underground animation roots colliding with the mythical world of Middle Earthbr br And what Bakshi and his animation team bring to the film is one that ends up giving what is on screen in all its abbreviated form its hit or miss appeal Along with being not totally complete as a film or as stories the form of the film is an experiment to see if something can be entirely rotoscoped The results end up bringing what seems now to be retro but at the time of course was something that was a rough crazy inspiration on the part of the filmmakers Might it have been better with more traditional drawn animation In some parts yeah it does become a little noticeable as was also the case in Bakshis American Pop that the main characters move in such ways that are a little shaky like some kind of comicbook form done in a different way Still theres much I admired in what was done br br The orcs for example I found to be really amazing in theyre surreal surroundings Theyre maybe the best part of the combination of the animation on top of the liveaction especially during parts where there isnt battle footage thats really the real hitormiss section as there isnt continuity from the good and bad rotoscoping and the chiaroscuro comes through with big shapes on top of horseback Its creepy in a good way And the backgrounds while also very rough and sometimes too sketchy are beautiful with the mixtures and blasts of colors together Its almost something for artfilm buffs as much as for the ringnutsbr br So how would I recommend this animated take on the Lord of the Rings I dont know to tell the truth Its certainly a good notch above the other Tolkien animated film Ive seen the Hobbit and Ive yet to see the animated ROTK and there is some real artistry going on Theres also some stilted dialog an alltoorushed Two Towers segment with the most intriguing character Gollum being reduced to maybe two scenes in all And seeing something as fragmented like this ends up only reinforcing the completeness of the more recent films br br If youre a fan of the books contemplating checking this out I would say its worth a chance even if its one of those chances where you watch for forty minutes and then decide whether to stop it or not As for it fitting into Bakshis other films Ive seen its an impressive ambitious and spotty achievement where as with Lynchs Dune its bound to draw a dark mordorlike line in the sand between those who hate it passionately and those who dont I dont,positive
In the first one it was mainly giant rats but there were some wasps and a giant chicken too This one however is just giant rats period well giant rats and one really growing little boy This one is about this growing boy and a scientist that is trying to help him so he accidentally creates giant killer ratsyou know how it is This movie has some kills and its moments but I find it to be on par with the original I just prefer some variety in my giant creature movies Well that is not trueI actually like Empire of the Ants maybe I just do not care for giant rodents All in all a rather drab movie though it does have one rather odd turn of events in this one dream sequence that is truly bizarre I just cant recommend this one,negative
Feature of early 21 century cinema of lets pit different evil creatures and bad guys against each other We havent seen stuff like this since Godzilla v King Kong and the like Always sounds great on paper when youre splicing up and in a haze of the good stuff you have an inspired idea and see the whole playing out before you like Beethovens symphonies Then you come to writing it Great ideas like all vampires are female Ergo hot seductive deadly but in a way I want to perish sort of way And all zombies are men well thats what men are like to a woman just after shes been dumped or cheated on right So it all looks good up to actually making it Then the rot starts to set in Mosters have fight Nothing much happens Another fight Philosophical noodling and cods wallop Eureka weve found how to win Big fight again and the End Sounds great doesnt it If it was made an indie company it would be great But this is Hollywood with the eye on the bucks gloss instead of what the fans want It all could have been gore soaked beautiful,negative
Lets get things straight I was raised Catholic and in a very religious family and spent as much time at church and talking to priests as at home That was useful for two things to make a convinced Atheist out of me and to give me deep insightful knowledge about the Church and its dogmas And I say if a Catholic priest witnesses a murder and clearly sees the face of the killer he CAN report it to the police even if the murderer has confessed to him afterwards He can not reveal what hes told in confession but he CAN talk about anything he sees outside that and confession is useless to keep his mouth shut So here we have a movie entirely sustained on a lie And another lie is theres no absolution for murder According to the Catholic Church theres absolution for any sin as long as theres sincere repentance So far the biggest plot holes in this weak thrillerbr br As people frequently say this movie would have improved if Bob Hoskins and Alan Bates had switched roles Hoskins is naturally suitable to play gangsters I will never lament enough that he lost Al Capone in favor of one of De Niros weakest performances in The Untouchables and Bates features would have been perfect as the priest with a gray past But above that I think the film would have been much better had reallife Ulster native Liam Neeson back then mostly unknown to big audiences played Mickey Rourkes part Not only his face is perfect to play tormented characters but hed make us believe the character as real something Rourke just cant Back in the 80s Rourke was not a bad actor afterwards he seemed to lose his talent along with his looks but he was one of those performers like Brad Dourif whos as good as the director he works with And as a former IRA terrorist Rourkes acting comes across more like a pimp Sad to think that had this movie been made just some three to six years later when Neeson achieved moderate celebrity status in 1990 with Sam Raimis enjoyable Darkman and superstardom in 1993 with Schindlers List while Rourke became pretty much of a forgotten hasbeen Liam and Mickey could have switched parts to greater benefit Rourke would have been effective in the supporting role of Docherty but just cant carry this movie along as the lead Yet another missed opportunity and yet another film with the potential of being a classic that became instantly forgettable farebr br Ironically enough the often criticized score by underrated composer Bill Conti worked for me I didnt find it overlymelodramatic but suitably gritty and beautiful It reminded me of Howard Shores score for The Silence of the Lambs Heres to Mike Hodges talent who made Get Carter yes but dont forget hes the mastermind behind Flash Gordon as wellbr br It seems the film was massacred in the cutting room it shows as some parts are really choppy and confusing and others just dont glue and a Directors Cut is waiting to see the light OK but I seriously doubt that will make it a great movie as well still have the bad casting and the false premise there 410,negative
Since the 70s writerproducerdirector Charles Band has been responsible for literally hundreds of sciencefiction fantasy and horror Bmovies Some of them are wonderful examples of how to use a tiny budget to maximum effect many of them are pretty bad Trancers 1985 was one of those rare gemsbr br A Terminator style tale of timetravel and action Trancers saw Tim Thomerson playing Jack Deth a future cop given the task of tracking down badguy Whistler who travels into the past by inhabiting the body of an ancestor Whistler is capable of controlling other humans with his psychic powers converting them into obedient zombies the trancers of the title and attempts to alter the course of history by killing off the ancestors of the leaders of the future Jack follows him to 1985 determined to stop himbr br In this 1991 sequel Jack is still living in 1985 Having destroyed Whistler he has settled down and married Leena Helen Hunt the young woman who helped him succeed in the first movie But for Jack things dont stay calm for long and trouble appears in the form of Whistlers brother ED Wardo who is trying to build a trancer armybr br Trancers II lacks the charm and simplicity of the original and is a huge disappointment considering how good the original was The story is difficult to pick up if you havent seen the first film or at least not for a long while and there is loads of unimpressive action and a few poor special effects Gone is the inventiveness and wit that made Trancers so much fun instead we get some cheesy oneliners and a script that feels like it was written ontheflybr br About the only reason I can give for recommending this film to fans of the genre is the cast which boasts many names that will be familiar to followers of scifi and horror movies Jeffrey Combs Barbara Crampton Richard Lynch Martine Beswicke Unfortunately most of them seemed to be having an off day whilst filming Trancers II and performances are mediocre at bestbr br The Trancers series obviously has its fans four further sequels have since been churned out Unless the quality has taken up massive upward swing I cant imagine them being any good,negative

In my life I have seen many great and awful movies I am not an expert in professional reviews but I have definitely something to say about this one Firstly these actors are the worst I have seen Their acting is so unreal that you even want to throw away the DVD in the first 2 minutes I think that these actors were not interested in the quality br br Another awful thing is about these dialogs  they are so lame You sometimes feel uncomfortable when you hear them It seems that your 14 year old son could act better I feel that this movie had a budget similar to the cost of my 14 year old European carbr br Please if my message reaches you  save your time and money,negative
Pola X is a beautiful adaption of Herman Melvilles Pierre or the Ambiguities The comments on here surprise me it makes me wonder what has led to the overwhelmingly negative reaction br br The shock value is the least appealing thing about this film  a minor detail that has been blown out of proportion The story is of Pierres downfall  and the subsequent destruction of those around him  which is overtly demonstrated in his features demeanour and idiolect The dialogue and soundtrack set this film apart from any other I have seen and turn a fundamentally traditional storyline with controversial twists into an unforgettably emotional epicbr br I cant stress enough the importance of disregarding everything you have heard about this film and watching as I did with an open mind You will I hope be rewarded in the same way that I was I felt on edge and nervous from around the halfhour mark however the film is far from scary in any traditional sense It will leave you with 1000 thoughts each of them at once troublesome and thrilling I know Im gushing here but I feel the need to make up for the negative perception of this film Its the best Ive seen all year,positive
This little short absolutely fascinates mebr br The only thing Ive seen thus far like it is some of the work by Sam Brakhage the creator of Dog Star Man However where Brakhage is trying to unnerve by making us learn how to see again and provide us with an affront of headache inducing bright colors and flashes which I still totally dig and embrace as high art this film I would characterize as very relaxing and hypnotizing Man Rays general use of spinning objectscamera does not create so much of a dizzy feeling but a warm flow of senses intermingling and going along with the gravity of the moving world around usbr br An interesting conceit of this very short work is that as it goes along objects become more and more recognizable until we end on a nude torso of which I feel is the least feminine wellrounded breasts Ive ever seen The circles and spirals of shadow and light over the torso make it an object of surrealistic beauty something that you could hang on your wall and delve over forever Its because of this and other images in this film that I had to watch it again and again eventually a total seven times just because it utterly fascinates mebr br PolarisDiB,positive
Thin story concerns two small town brothers and their struggles over family honor David Morse is the responsible straightlaced cop and good brother Viggo Mortensen the bad boy is a former soldier and exconvict As an actor particularly in his earliest years Sean Penn seems to have modulated his performances under the Method Turning firsttime writer and director for this arty obtuse drama he works his script and characters out through the same methodical process slowing the pacing down to a crawl ostensibly so we can catch every nuance and inflection This approach might be fascinating if there were threedimensional characters to care about but photogenic Morse and Mortensen arent really convincing as siblings Worse we expect more from prominentlybilled veterans Charles Bronson and Sandy Dennis who hardly get a chance to come through with anything interesting The picture is balky with turgid sequences a wobbly narrative and confusing editing always slanted to point up the artistic excesses Penns tricks with the camera show off a talented eye yet they are mostly an irritation 12 from ,negative
I was a huge fan of Asterix comics when I was a kid and watched every one I never heard about this movie when it was released but I watched it with my kids last night I remembered the comic well enough to know that a lot was added to the story for the film Some of the changes I thought were a bit corny like the nephews modern dancing and the viking chiefs daughter  almost everything about her but I found most it amusing enough Most importantly seeing the reactions as my kids watched it confirmed that the film pleased its target audience As a family film it works better than other Asterix titles Ive seen Many of the names that werent in the book I found had the same appeal as ones that were Overall an enjoyable family film regardless of whether youre an asterix fan or not,positive
To say I was disappointed is an understatement An amateur film made by professionals I was about to leave the theater in two or three occasions something Ive never doneI was stopped by Cloris Leachman really She rings true the only one I should say This new women are less modern than the George Cukor women of the 30s This ones are acting for us trying to be with it but their conflict is exactly the same as it has always been in movies anyway The fun of the original was based on a crisp vitriolic and very funny script A masterful direction and an unrepeatable cast All the elements that are missing here TV actresses mingling with models and Oscar nomineeswinners There wasnt anything organic about it The whole thing felt like a put on improvised in the moment without a clear objective 210,negative

First there are some plot holes in this movie We see in the very beginning a kid dies from playing the game But who was tied up in the mail truck delivering the package which contains the game How did the driver place the package into the mailbox when he was lashed to the steering wheel It is not like he was Mr Fantastic Wow that in just the first 15 minutes The actors are second rate take the Bad Guy played by Patrick Kilpatrick who exactly he has appeared in one episode of everything on TV and some secondary roles in poor movies like this one So most of the acting is like TV dramas I can live with that but the graphics or special effects are horrible The disembodied Game voice sounds like a poor clone of Hal from Space Oddessy 2000 What they called Zombies looked more like shadows jumping around like monkeys from Planet of the Apes The Aliens had transparent bodies like the shadow zombies In most cases the movie was just predictable as it had no hook or hidden agenda going The story was a good idea but like most good ideas discussed over lunch was never developed beyond that good idea stage,negative
I first saw this movie on cable about 5 years ago and I could not stop laughing Everything about this movie seemed to click the storyline the characters the setting As far as film is concerned I wouldnt call this a great movie but for what it is supposed to be it is fantastic It gets its meaning across The cast is maybe as good as any ever put together in a comedy movie Corben Berbson Fred Gwynne Ruben Blades and Ed ONeil are hilarious For this who havent seen it I will give you a brief synopsis Four Criminals meet up in a small town in Montana after receiving a letter from their friend about a bank heist However when their friend is arrested by two cops who chased him from New Jersey they try to figure out whats going on and all hell breaks loose The film is truly a great bank caper comedy and is sort of like a poor mans version of Oceans Eleven only with four criminals who cant stand each other and in Montana rather than Las Vegas All in all if like to laugh I would strongly encourage you to see this movie,positive

Infamous for being brought to you by the digital effects team behind Independence Day Coronado is even more of a spectacular failure just from being juxtaposed with ID4 This ridiculous mess of a film starts off with a brainless premise and goes completely downhill from there A wealthy soon to be married couple in Beverly Hills are the subjects of this idiotic story Claires fiancée has taken off on a business trip right around Christmas so she decides to spontaneously fly to Switzerland so they can spend the holiday together I especially love that her initial reason for wanting to go was because he had left some documents at home that she thought he might need She grabbed them up and yelled after him while he drove away concluding that her best bet would be to fly to the other side of the planet rather than call his cell phone I refuse to believe that a couple living in such a cavernous mansion as theirs were unaware of the existence of mobile phonesbr br So up until this point the movie is unbelievably bad but check this out THIS is where it starts to get bad She gets to Switzerland and when she cant find her husband she gets some cake and calls her friend to whine about how unfair it all is This woman is not an action hero and she is DEFINITELY not a German Indiana Jones for crying out loud She is an overgrown cheerleader a pampered sorority girl whose outdoor experience is probably limited to digging her spike heels out of the ground when she gets tipsy enough to wander onto the lawn during a wine and cheese party out on the bluffsbr br She gets a tip that her fiancée is in South America so she like totally flies there to get him Once there this moron thinks shes going to go into the jungle by herself sniff out the enemy base and rescue her poor helpless boyfriend She laughs off a comment about the danger of going in there then freaks out later because she finds out that there are battles going on You never said anything about battlebr br There is one point where Claire and some journalist that she met up with drive this huge truck across a bridge that is hundreds of feet high and hundreds of feet across and suspended by two by fours Literally There are thousands of thin pieces of wood tied together with twine and these morons decide to drive over it Not only does it crumble under the weight of the truck but Claire manages to fall off of it falling hundreds of feet and landing on her back in the shallow river below Later she recalls the event laughing it off like oh maybe it was only a hundred At least she wasnt twirling gum on her fingersbr br What is truly sad about this catastrophically bad movie is that they even managed to coax a terribly performance out of the tremendously talented John RhysDavies a REAL Indiana Jones veteran There is a lot of nonsense about an uprising at the end of the film where we meet an extremist rebel leader who when we first meet him has such a thick accent that he rolls his rs like he thinks hes in a Ruffles commercial then later he talks like some guy they pulled off the streets of Venice Beach Unbelievablebr br The special effects are negligible The team that brought you Independence Day by the very fact that they were involved with ID4 was simply going through the motions throwing together some matted and blue screen shots I have to believe because they just had nothing better to do The story is astonishingly bad and Kristin Dattilo who many other IMDb users cite as the only reason to see the film doesnt put the slightest effort into her performance Maybe she thought the digital effects team behind Independence Day could superimpose some meaning into this messbr br And given how far theyve fallen maybe they thought they could toobr br They could at least have tried,negative

This poor remake of the 1963 classic starts reasonably well then replaces suspense with muddled and pointless special effects For example in the original one of the most chilling moments occurs when Nell and Theo are lying side by side in twin beds listening in terror to the noises outside their room Nell tells Theo to let go of her hand because she is hurting her Nell then looks across at Theo who is several feet away and realises that it was not Theo holding her hand In the latest version Nell is lying alone in bed when suddenly she dives out and slides across the floor It is only when she tells the unseen force to stop pulling her that we realise what has happened And can anybody explain what Nells final words mean  Its about family Its always been about familybr br The one redeeming feature is Lili Taylors performance but even this cannot save the film Catherine ZetaJones demonstrates once again that beneath her pretty exterior there is little depth In the original Claire Bloom subtly suggested her lesbian persuasion ZetaJones however has to spell it out for example by asking Nell if she has a boyfriend  or girlfriendbr br Definitely one which should be consigned to the pointless remakes graveyard,negative

If you enjoy suspense this movie has it The fact that Marina Zudina portrays a mute adds to her haplessness and increases the suspense Alec Guinesss appearance was nice but didnt really add to the movie Im not sure if Evan Richards part as Andy Clarke was an attempt to add a little humor or if he was supposed to just be a bumbling idiot I thought the cinematography was excellent This added not just to the quality of the production but to the suspense as well The bathtub seen with the water droplets in slow motion was wonderful Also the scene where the knife comes down and then it switches to Andy Clarke cutting an extremely rare piece of meat was very well done I would call it overall good entertainment,positive

I found this movie to be charming I thought the characters were developed since as I watched I found myself caring about these people This is a period piece that I believe took place during the depression A single mother who is known as the town recluse she has reason to be puts an ad in the paper for a Husband Christopher Reeve plays a excon who happens into town looking for work He sees the ad and he goes out to see her She hires him I really had some chuckles as their relationship progresses because I found it easy to put myself in their shoes Everything went on so matter of fact He needs the work so he doesnt want to upset her And she needing his help but doesnt want him to get the upper hand They dance around the fact that they begin to really need each other Things start warming up until the big blowup I wont spoil it by telling you what happens But the point of resolution is perfectly wonderful I found the story to be very believable for the time its taking place I think this is one of the better relationship stories out there Maybe the younger generation wont get it but if you are over 40 I think youll like it And if you liked Christopher Reeve in Somewhere in Time youll like him in this one also,positive
I caught this movie late one night and never knew what hit me This was one of the most disturbing movies I have ever seen yet had me on the edge of my seat waiting to see what would happen next Alan Rickman is an excellent bad guy but this character beats all others Ive never been so affected by a movie Its been 6 years and I still cant forget Closet Land,positive
Since I first saw Anchors Aweigh in 1945 viewing it on videotape holds a lot of nostalgia for me At age 15 it was easy for me to be drawn into the first of the great MGM Technicolor musicals Now I am perhaps most interested in thinking about the future careers of the leading players Though Sinatra had done a couple of negligible films soon after his emergence after his Dorsey days as a solo singer this was his first major film appearance As another viewer noted this seems almost to be a warmup for On the Town Sinatra may have had to work hard at it but his dance with Kelly is credible and he would do better in their next pairings However observing his physique its easy to see why he was caricatured as a string bean Who would have imagined that within a decade he would win an academy award for acting and go on to play many roles as a tough detective or leader in combat Though Gene Kellys personality and dancing dominated this film his winsome performance did not suggest that he would become a major creative force almost the iconic figure for MGM musicals where he developed a style of dance complementary to that of Fred Astaire Finally it was strange to see the freshfaced Dean Stockwell and remember that he would later play a thrill killer in Compulsion based on the LeopoldLoeb murder from the 1920s An additional note One reviewer praised the performance of Betty Garrett as Sinatras love interest She later played opposite him in On the Town but Pamela Britton was featured in this film,positive

I saw this movie by accident yesterday at a cinema I had some hopes for the movie because I really like Spoorloos The Vanishing and the book its based on The movie starts out okay as it at first seems to be a nice thriller Quickly though the movie becomes a mess with uninteresting plotlines characters that are never fleshed out and nobody in the audience cared for like Marjoke and terrible editing The movie has fade to black bits that are just way too long a messed up chronology that jumps back and forth and lots of scenes that just dont add anything to the story and could easily have been dropped After suffering through the story youll get treated to one of the worst endings Ive seen in a very long It should also be mentioned that the movie has lots of explicit sex scenes which youre probably used to if you watch a lot of dutch movies Its hard to mention any good things about this movie About a third of the audience had already walked out of the theater halfway into the movie and I didnt hear a kind word after the movie was over Avoid this movie at all costs it really destroyed any faith I had left in the dutch movie industry,negative

I dont know what this movie is about really Its like a students art school project They never say why the world is dark but it is always darkness except for seconds a day There are long interrupting shots of insects of all sorts for no reason What little dialogue there is in the movie is as inane and nonsensical as the images A black woman enters the main characters apartment Somehow she becomes pregnant overnight then gets shot in the head The main character takes care of the body until it becomes a cocoon after which a white naked woman emerges I have never been so blown away by how bad and pointless a movie can be Honestly I would like someone to watch it so they can tell me what they think its about But I wouldnt wish this level of hell on anybody else,negative
Wow I was really disappointed I wasnt really planning on seeing this movie in the theater and I wish I stuck to that plan It really should be a madefortv movie I was kind of excited to see it as Im a big fan of Fairuza Balk but this movie didnt do her justice Infact Im a little disappointed with the acting all around What a horrible cover up of Fairuza Balks tattoos it bothered me every time I saw her shoulder br br There was no flow to the movie it was very hard to get into it One scene we get angry hyped up we want blood the anticipation rises just then the director takes us to another scene to show the love between Annie and Bobby It would have been more enjoyable to follow if it was broken up into three sectional sunday paper comic stripbr br There was also little logic behind the characters chosen to play some parts The gangster leaders were scrawny guys not very believable Matt Dillon head of a mobster organization Come on give me a break There was just no intimidation there br br The soundtrack wow I think this is one of the worst musical scores Ive ever heard What awful guitar solos my god The sound of my teeth grinding was more pleasing to my friends Im sure br br Anyhow there is one positive comment Id like to make about the movie The settings were nicely done I liked the colours a good job conveying that time period,negative
Born raised and educated in Scotland I was appalled at this disgusting portrayal of a man who was no more nor less than a cattle rustler Worse yet the thread of the entire movie was sex in one form or another by implication or verbally To view it one would think that 18th century Scotland was populated by a bunch of sex perverts and homosexuals Lange was a joke acting as the young mother at age 49 but Liam Neeson was even worse Taking a bath in a Scottish loch is NOT commonplace as they portrayed him  but it did give them yet another opportunity to demonstrate how sexually driven we were Save your money and watch Pinnochio,negative

This film is remarkable in how unremarkable it is This is the true story of one woman and one man and their quest for happiness amid the dull rote life of a housewife and man of the house It could be any couple any family in any town but thats what makes the story so moving It touches each of us in some way and reminds us of someone we know and love or of ourselves I laughed I cried I couldnt stop thinking about it and what more could you ask for from a film really Especially a documentary This is an excellent film and one that I highly recommended to anyone who enjoys documentaries stories about families like yours stories about love life parenting loss expectations soul searching yearning wandering through life and finding your way or not,positive

Worst show Ive ever seen The story is about a group of teenagers who for some inexplicable reason have super powers and when they use some special device they morph into strange poorly designed suits The acting when theyre not in the retardedlooking suits is decent Definitely not good but not the worst acting Ive ever seen However when wearing their suits the actors acting goes from bad to worse much much worse The hyperanimated idiots have a myriad of unnecessary motions they do Even when they talk they look like theyre having seizures The villains are stupider than the Rangers Every episode some weak idiotic villain comes up with some plan to destroy the Rangers Heshe then sends a force of hyperanimated aliens to attack the Rangers The Rangers then initialize their 10hour transforming animation then they annihilate the aliens Then the poorly designed villain which can either be an armored villain that actually looks and acts evil to a humanoid ladybuglike creature with trumpets attached to its back that shows obvious signs of mental retardation The Power Rangers fight the villain off then the villain turns into Godzilla whether it be by a rain cloud or a nuclear missile yes they fire nukes at the creatures and the creatures turn into giants The Power Rangers spend 5 minutes acting hyperanimated and summon their Zords which are obviously toys that the producers of the show used special effects on to make them look real The Power Rangers win the villain gets mad they all teach a valuable lesson and the show ends Thats it Twentyfive minutes of brainwashing fake kung fu fighting,negative

i never made any comment here on IMDb but as i saw this movie i cant be quiet i just set up my account here only because this horrible movie in two words this movie is PURE CRAP the movie has no sense at all Nothing makes sense in this movie Watching this movie was pain all the way I dont understand why Val Kilmer agreed to do this movie He plays a minor role as a gang leader says few words and he is there like 5 minutes totalbr br I bought this DVD based only because of Val Kilmer name on the box and the interesting pictures on the coverbr br As was stated in other review Moscow Zero stole my money and I want it back The title of the movie itself brought the clue about the rating everyone should give it ZERO,negative
This is yet another gritty and compelling film directed by Sam Fuller in the early 1950s This minimalist and fastworking director has something unusual for his earlier filmsa cast with some stars Richard Widmark Jean Peters and Richard Kiley star in this film about a group of Communist agents who are trying to sneak secrets out of Americaand theyll stop at nothing to succeedbr br The film starts with Peters on a subway car being watched by federal agents They know she is a link in a long espionage chain Unknown to everyone is the wild card in the equationa smalltime pickpocket Widmark is also on the train and he manages to steal the secrets that Peters is carrying Widmark thinks its just another purse hes ransackedonly later does he realize the seriousness of what hes stolen Now its Widmark on his ownwith Commies and the FBI hot on his trailbr br Widmark and the rest are exceptional and the film is gripping from start to finish Although she didnt get top billing a special mention should be made of Thelma Ritter This supporting actress had perhaps the performance of her lifetime as a stool pigeon Seldom was she given this much of a chance to act and I was impressed by her ability to play a broken down and sad old ladybr br As far as the script and directing go they are very goodbut with one small exception At first I loved the way Widmark and Peters interacted Its one of the few times on film youll see a woman punched square in the mouth Now THATS tough Later inexplicably they become amazingly closetoo close to be believable Still with so much great drama and such an effective Noirlike film this can be overlooked See this film,positive
Joe was first released in the US in the summer of 1970 Despite respectable notices reasonable box office and an Oscar nom it vanished shortly afterwards and remained forgotten about throughout the 1980s before being enthusiastically reappraised somewhat unjustly in the US in the late 90s Thanks to this lengthy unavailability its reputation has gone on to see it placed inexplicably alongside the likes of Michael Winners original Death Wish Although revenge is a theme a film about vigilantism this most definitely is notbr br The plot isnt worth synopsizing Its a flabby hammy and bizarrely stagey ramble about an accidental murder and the unlikely relationship that blossoms out of it That relationship and the largely classbased quirks of its two leads are exaggerated into ridiculous caricature these two and their situation bear absolutely no relation to realitybr br Almost everything about the film is cantankerous and begrudgingly antiquated which makes the whole thing completely fascinating Hippies are depicted as snide and exclusive misanthropes hard drugs either make you sleep or dance around maniacally with lipstick on your face and most young women are prepared to have sex with strangers in exchange for marijuana at the drop of a fly Its very much a film of the 60s rather than the 70s so why some industry luminaries have begun to include it in retrospective conversations about the beginnings of the Hollywood New Wave is a complete mystery Martin Scorcese of all people even got involved though probably only to give a nod to the dank lavatorial hues of the grim urban cinematography which almost certainly influenced Taxi Driver four years later But Joe seems very much like a furious tirade against the likes of Easy Rider and Bonnie And Clyde rather than a continuation of that same insurgent cinematic ethosbr br It isnt a film of any real artistic significance  despite Joes incontinent fury at everything in his world it remains a story about absolutely nothing  but its value as a cultural museum piece is unprecedented Shot on and around the streets of New York City during the darkest hours of the Vietnam war and at a time when America and significantly its cinema was being revolutionized to the horror of the old guard the film ends up in its own completely oblivious and accidental way saying more about that period of history than numerous infinitely superior movies that directly endeavored to capture itbr br But as a film Despite a really surprising and effective shock ending this is basically a Michael Winner film but not as well made How does that tickle your fancy  Incidentally if you are like me a fan of spotting arbitrary background lookalikes then check out Harold Steptoe at 12211 in the hippy art gallery,negative

So when I first saw commercials for Greek I did have a few questions to how they were going to approach Greek life if they were going to give away sacred frat and sorority secrets if they were going to focus on the brother and sisterhood a fraternity or sorority brings or what most college kids think of Greek life as a huge partybr br Luckily it covered everything The story plot was great it gave you a character to love hate someone you want to be like someone you dont want to be like and of course a crazy roommatebr br It was one of my first looks at what writers believed Greek life to be like and I can honestly say they hit the nail pretty dead onbr br I love how one of the biggest things they covered throughout the season was the relationship between Rusty and his crazy roommate Its hard enough moving away from home and being forced to live in a small room with someone you dont even know then come to find out you have nothing in common Probably every college bound freshmens worst nightmarebr br Rustys sister Casey was pretty much the typical girl on campus EVERYONE is jealous of What didnt she have Oh thats right Evan all to herself Rebecca and Evan had an affair early into the season which made you feel fairly sympathetic for Casey Her character evolved and her relationship with Rusty became more and more loving and outgoing br br Cappie is one of the most fun loving characters and absolutely insane One of my favorite episodes included him getting completely trashed at a strip club and Rusty having to call Casey to bail them out I like how they addressed the issue of gay people in Greek houses Calvin was a very real feeling character and I really respected him because he stuck to his standards So Jen K was fairly crazy but she actually liked Rusty It was surprising and I continued to question her from the start but of course I did want it to work out between her and Rustybr br I am definitely looking forward to the return of Greek It takes you into the truth of Greek life something that a lot of people look past One of the biggest things that frats and sororities are known for is parties and drinking Greek is a great show and the characters are easy to relate to,positive
Looking for Quo Vadis at my local video store I found this 1985 version that looked interesting Wow It was amazing Very much a Ken Russell kind of film quirky stylized very artistic and of course different Nero was presented not so much as evil incarnate but as a wacky unfulfilled emperor who would rather have had a circus career He probably wondered why on earth he was put in the position of leading an empire it wasnt much fun and fun is what he longed for Klause Maria Bandaur had a tremendous time with this role and played it for all it was worth Yes Nero persecuted the Christians with a vengeance one of many who did so At one point one of his henchmen murmurs No one will ever understand we were simply protecting ourselves He got that right,positive

but itll make you wonder if we had any in the first place This movie is just as bad as any of todays horrible horror A man goes around ogling semiclad ladies trying to decide which one to kill so he can give his girlfriend a new body One scene involves a man staggering around and spurting all over the set for a full three minutes coating everything what what must be well over ten gallons of blood The movie also attempts to create a sense that what the man is doing to his girlfriend is wrong and against nature but the movie is so badly done its impossible for the audience to dredge up any feeling of shock or outrage Aimlessly dark and unimpressively sinister this movie cant even get its own title straight the beginning credits say The Brain That Wouldnt Die but the end credits list it as The Head That Wouldnt Die,negative

Miyazaki has been doing his mojo since the 70s and its only been recently that his movies have made it American shores via Disney and fans fawning over his great talent Ponyo is no exception Although some of his other movies have been a bit more accessible to US audiences some may find this one a bit on the fence being sortof Japanese in its presentation For the same reason Pom Poko is VERY Japanese and doesnt make much sense to US audiences so too are some elements of Ponyo This should not detract you from watching this fun film of growth hope and friendshipbr br What does come across well is Miyazakis very elaborate and magical animation and story that has elements of wonder and fantasy That coupled with his characteristic use of character development and often using girls and women as main characters He steps out of his zone a bit with Ponyo as the main character is a little boy who lives in a small village by the sea with his mom while his dad is away at work on the high seas Although not lonely Sosuke is just like any other curious boy who likes adventure and allure of the sea Similar to Spirited Away we see the different worlds of the humans and the sea creatures and I feel that Miyazaki may be trying to draw the viewers attention to the vast and undiscovered nature of things that live beneath the sea and our acceptance of them and thing that are differentbr br I managed to watch the subtitled version of this last year and was pleased by the story and plot Miyazaki has claimed that this is my last movie for many years but shortly after Spirited Away he gave us Howls Moving Castle Ponyo is certainly proof that Miyazaki has not hung up his spurs and continues to delight innovate and pioneer the most creative animated movies of all time Watch Ponyo with an open mind and a tip of the hat to childhood fantasy and imagination and youll be transported back to when catching Fireflies and secret hiding places were more important than boring grownup stuff and eating your vegetables,positive

Im not a follower of a certain movie genre I classify movies only as industrial or nonindustrial Valentine is the second industrial movie of the director Jamie Blanks after his Urban Legends Unlike Urban Legends the screenplay and the story line is very weak Yet again unlike Urban Legends the basic elements of the movie is so dashing and iconic and that is what makes Valentine the best br br As the first basic and iconic element the growing hatred of the serial killer is so downtoearth Since his secondary school years he has grown up with his wounds he had accumulated in his soul against his classmate girlfriends who have made fun of him When you concentrate enough on this first element while watching the movie you will come to see this point of view of Humanism Noone is entirely good or evil In fact somebody known as evil can be secretly kind hearted Just because the story line and the direction is very weak we are not as satisfied as we deserved br br The second iconic element is of course the magnificent togetherness of the late 90s super starlets My favourite is Jessica Cauffiel who is killed within the coolest way to be killed An arrow shot from a bow broaches her tummy and stays stuck in while she was playing hideandseek with her blind date never able to met with Katherine Heigl is the first starlet getting killed in a biology laboratory while trying to hide under human body models lying on the surgical operation tables Denise Richards is killed third while she just found a Valentines Day gift for her at a whirlpool bath Jessica Capshaw is killed last in a confidential and unseen way then she is calumniated to be as the serial killer Marley Shelton is the unluckiest one with a vicissitude of fortune that she is going to be killed within the most confidential way that we will never know cause the movie is coming to an end before she is getting killed Finally Benita Ha is the luckiest one since she was not a classmate of the serial killer David Boreanazbr br The third and the last iconic element is the soundtrack from the blind date labyrinth scene the Valentines Day celebration at Dorothys house scenes and ultimately the killing themes Everybody has loved the soundtrack as far as I know Hard Rock never suits better within a serial killermystery movie,positive

Jakes Closet has the emotional power of Kramer vs Kramer combined with the imagination of Pans Labyrinth Even the beginning special effect seems to give a nod to Pans Labyrinth But this is a story that takes place in modern times not in a war sixty years ago and in that way it has even more resonance today Jakes Closet is about a boy an only child practically alone on summer vacation dealing with his family falling apart Its a horror movie like The Others and The Sixth Sense a horror movie for the thinking person If youre looking for a slasher movie this wont be your cup of tea but if youre looking for a story that is both touching and suspenseful with good acting this is the movie for you At the screening I saw I swear there was one moment where the entire audience screamed I highly recommend catching this film,positive

For all of you that dont speak swedish The swedish original title of this film Rånarna translates into something in the line of The Robbers This fact is the main problem I have with the film cause its not really about the robbers at all Its about a young woman working for the swedish police researching robberies A regular desk job one would think but this girl is soon out on the field taking matters into her own hands as the story goes even shooting one of the robbers Exactly Weve seen this before The fact that theres a rather interesting twist to the plot halfway through doesnt really help as the ending is just as cliché as the first two thirds of the filmbr br What saves it from being just another mainstream film is the fact that its masterfully executed in all ways that the actors are as great as they are and dont overact and that the director really manages to keep it as thrillingly exciting as it is for the most of the storybr br One thing that I really loved about this film is the fact that its music sets the right mood when its needed but is absent for the rest of the time which gives a nice sense of reality to the shootouts and carchases spread throughout the film A nice touch The fact that Michael Persbrandt is one of the few swedish actors that often tend to get typecasted sadly hurts the film as you know that hes not going to just play the boyfriend of the heroine and be a supporting character in the background but thats something you have to neglectbr br All in all its an entertaining film that steals more money in its plot than time from you 710,positive

This film is absolutely horrific One of the worst movies Ive ever seen The story does nearly not exist the characters are full of stereotypes and the SpecialFX only make you laugh The only remarkable thing about this movie is the guest appearance of the Rapper Coolio as some kind of police officerbr br If this film was supposed to be a comedy I didnt quite get the point If you want to watch this movie please get yourself drunk first and then prepare for some good laughsespecially when the first SpecialFX appear on the screenbr br But if you like trash movies made on the cheap this film is a mustsee for you,negative
because if I was I may have wished it was me being crucified on a wooden cross Im still trying to determine the plot of this movie  and Im being generous that there was even a plot to begin with As previously mentioned its a misnomer on the cover of the DVD that Richard Dreyfuss is actually the star He was barely in the movie And if he was indeed frustrated as the back cover indicated he was well thats probably because he said YES to be in this disaster of a movie and couldnt get out of it The movie really seemed to focus on Jared Martin and what his role in the movie was supposed to be other than the extreme close ups was not as big of a mystery as to what Gene Barrys role actually was  or wasnt And speaking of bigwhomever had the bright idea to fit Gene Barry in the Humpty Dumpty attire which showcased his trousers literally pulled up to his chin should be sentenced to hard time by watching this movie stoned sober I could go on and on about how horrendous this movie was from the dialogue not matching the actors mouths think Clutch Cargo to the erratic jumping from scene to scene again being generous even calling the frames of pictures scenes to the lack of a plot However if youre into bad early 70s genre and if youre in a cottage in Michigan with nothing but this movie and a box of kid  cat pictures I recommend having a good bottle of wine before you embark on this weird ride of a movie because youll be thankful that you may not remember it the next day,negative

I attended the premier last night The movie started out with a bang perhaps due to prepremier excitement The audience laughed for about 15 minutes then most of us spent the rest of the time fighting off sleep This movie can not be compared to _Spinal Tap_ or any of Guests work unless you want to say _Sons of Provo_ is a wannabe gone awfully wrong It just fell flat it died it was painful The story went nowhere the jokes were bland even if you were a Mormon and could get all of the inside jokes it felt like a waste of time There were two redeeming qualities Kirbys acting was spot on And the songs were very clever for an LDS audience only So my recommendations Avoid the movie And if you are Mormon buy the music CD,negative
I think this film version of NORTHANGER ABBEY is actually quite good It certainly is amusing Well its not a masterpiece as PRIDE AND PREJUDICE 95 but theres very good stuff in it especially the City of Bath setting The Royal Crescent the Roman Baths the fascinating Georgian atmosphere That is excellent If you are a Bath fan like myself youll love watching this film The performances may sound a bit too melodramatic but Ive got the impression that this film like the novel itself is deliberately making fun of the popular tales of romance and terror and of the society of the period The only drawback is probably the female lead as I personally have another idea of Catherine Morlands physical appearance The music is also a bit unusual but I strangely find it acceptable despite its got nothing to do with the historical period portrayed Im wondering what would dear old Jane think,positive
OK when I saw the previews for this movie I thought it looked really scary and was quite excited to see it as were the group I was with Now living in America especially during this election I see some very deceiving things but I have to say these previews were towards the top of list I dont see how so many people could be scared by this movie I only really noticed two real jump scenes and only jumped at one The whole movie was extremely predictable and perhaps that messed up some of the jump scenes for me As for the sound effects so many to be so frightened of I thought they were comical at best Oh and the uhh catboy where did that come from and why The worst noise in the whole movie had to be the weird groaning How does that scare someone I can make that noise easily Now dont get me wrong I have always loved all those really bad scary movies that your just laughing the whole way through but I didnt even think this one had that going for it it was just plain out bad,negative
The untold origin of the Lone Ranger It shows who he was and how and why he became the Rangerbr br Legendary bomb The idea was not a bad onereinvent and introduce the Lone Ranger for 1980s audiences Right off the bat though there were problems The studio ordered Clayton Moore the original Ranger to stop appearing anywhere as the Lone Ranger It led to a nasty little battle that made headlines I know of people who refused to see the film because of how Moore was treated Also they hired the awesomely untalented Klinton Spilsbury to play the Ranger Spilsbury was very handsome and muscular but had absolutely no charisma and just couldnt act In fact his whole vocal performance was redubbed by another actor Also his off screen antics public drunkenness and beating people up didnt help matters Acting aside the script is dull and slow Also the Ranger himself doesnt show up until an HOUR in There were some complaints at the time that the movie was too violent for a PG However I dont think it was that badbr br There are a few very few things done right herethe photography was truly beautiful Michael Horse was excellent as Tonto Christopher Lloyd is lots of fun as the villain and when the Lone Ranger finally shows up with the William Tell Overture booming from the soundtrack its really rousing But all in all this is a boring and terrible attempt to bring back the Lone Ranger Its easy to see why this bombed A 4mostly for the photography,negative
Based on the book Space Vampires by Colin Wilson This is in my humble opinion one of the best pieces of SciFi Horror to come out of the eighties The effects done by ILM still hold up by todays standards The actors are mostly British and being british seem to give this film a greater depth of realismbr br  The film was panned by the critics and sadly failed to do well at the box office on both sides of the atlantic Tobe Hooper blamed the promotional work that was done before its release as the main cause for its low takings But for whatever reason it still does not detract from the fact that this is an excellent film with a great cast and wellpaced plotbr br  Not to be overlooked,positive

When Samantha Eggar as Phyllis Dietrickson answers the door of her house swathed in a towel you realize that as competent an actress as Eggar may be she doesnt have the hypnotic allure of Barbara Stanwyck And it is not entirely Eggars fault In the original film Wilder had Stanwyck not only appear in a towel but she enters the scene on the second floor balcony of the house And she doesnt come out she appears almost as if by magic Walter Neff is staring up at her from below on the first floor There is a reason for this Stanwyck is much higher than Neff Fred MacMurray when they are first introduced It is not just the towel The towel adds to the seductive allure Her pose is like a Greek Goddess overlooking her domain and in a strange way you feel as if from the start she is actually controlling the entire situation She has sexual even magic power This person is no ordinary housewife This person is a mystery with secrets hidden withinbr br Back to 1973 The remake has Crenna knock on the front door Stanwycks standin Eggar answers the door with a towel around her There is no appearance She simply opens the door The alluring superiority that grabs the audience at the first appearance of Stanwyck in 1944 is entirely absent in 1973 She opens the door with a towel around her It may be sexy in a Charlies Angels sort of way but its not nearly as mysterious The filmmakers of the remake seem to misunderstand Wilders point The script may have said Phyllis appears in towel so the filmmakers of the remake simply follow the instructions and include the required towel The point is not the towel The point is the enigmatic quality of Phyllis and the potential power she wields Wilder gave her a towel to add to her mystique The filmmakers of the remake gave her a towel because thats what Wilder did And in the choice of shot lost all of Phyllis mystiquebr br Richard Crenna also seems miscast He seems like hes acting and not really in the midst of the dilemma Part of the problem is Crenna appears so much like a 70s actor He cant get into the 1940s When MacMurray first speaks into the microphone sweat begins to drip from his face No sweat on Crenna And they also changed one of the crucial lines at the beginning In the original Neff says I didnt get the money and I didnt get the woman In the 1973 version Crenna says I didnt get the money and I didnt want the woman Did the filmmakers completely misunderstand the entire point of the story Or were they dumbing it down for a television audiencebr br This madeforTV movie is a bythenumbers rendition All the sharp edge of the original is lost The only standout maybe is Lee J Cobb in the role made famous by Edward G Robinson But he cannot save the loss of intensity of the original This 1973 boring remake is a forgettable TVmovie made probably by the same people who did Gilligans Island They might as well have tried to remake Citizen Kane or Gone with the Wind If mediocrity is the best one can hope for whats the point The 1944 classic is a Film with a capital F This madeforTV remake deserves an F grade or maybe a D for dumb,negative
There are good ways to make a movie and bad ways and this very much the former This short caper exacts nothing more than what it gives to the audience It presents a simple story told very plainly with enough wisecracks to keep you going then just gets better and better Clooneys cameo is funny and very welcome but the leads including Sam Rockwell and Luiz Guzman can easily make it on their own Likeable and funny hilariously so towards the end Welcome to Collinwood is a welcome addition to the heist genre,positive
I dont know what Margaret Atwood was thinking to allow this movie to have the same name as her book Ive always been a big fan of The Robber Bride and was so excited to learn there was a movie in the works I am aware that the translation of book to movie isnt perfect but this movie was the worst ever The names of the women are correct and some of the back story is correct but that is about it I feel like I lost a good portion of my time trying to make it through this movie This really should have been a miniseries to tell the story the way it was writtenbr br The actors for Roz Tony Charis and Zenia were wellchosen even though I was skeptical at first about MaryLouise Parker I only wish theyd had a better script to work with because this really had nothing to do with the book at all,negative
George P Cosmatos Rambo First Blood Part II is pure wishfulfillment The United States clearly didnt win the war in Vietnam They caused damage to this country beyond the imaginable and this movie continues the fairy story of the ohso innocent soldiers The only bad guys were the leaders of the nation who made this war happen The character of Rambo is perfect to notice this He is extremely patriotic bemoans that USAmericans didnt appreciate and celebrate the achievements of the single soldier but has nothing but distrust for leading officers and politicians Like every film that defends the war eg We Were Soldiers also this one avoids the need to give a comprehensible reason for the engagement in South Asia And for that matter also the reason for every single USAmerican soldier that was there Instead Rambo gets to take revenge for the wounds of a whole nation It would have been better to work on how to deal with the memories rather than suppressing them Do we get to win this time Yes you do,negative

This movie was absolute torture First of all its a whopping 4 hours long True the Kargil war may have had several points that were captured and fought for but every single one of those battles need not have been shown So maybe this is a documentary not a commercial film as advertised Sure didnt seem like it as enough background information was not given and there were some flaws The battle sequences were so poorly executed I am terribly disappointed from the man who gave well done sequences in Border Each battle was the exact same as the previous It was so predictable This might be a spoiler The whole army marches uphill five or so soldiers curse five thousand times each they also use the same cussword every time one of the lead actors is shot someone yells for a stretcher the actor says No dont get a stretcher That will take 6 men from the battalion and then an actor dies That exact same thing happens over and over and over again Oh and the songs are so bad and so long The cast of the movie is too big for its own good Despite such a long movie none of the characters were well developed The actresses had the most miniscule roles They all are dressed and portrayed to be the same Two of them were weeping synchronized It was so comical They moved their hands and heads at the exact same time and then bit their dupatta togetherbr br The list just goes on and on I know Im still forgetting something  Anyways I think I have bashed the film enough that you get the picture,negative

Sean Connery is very good as the Great Raisuli Lord of the Rif and Defender of the Faithful This is an adventure movie with Arabs Germans and the USMC all coming to grips at one point or another There is also a lot of humor in the interplay among the main and supporting characters The story is based on the true incident in which a wealthy GreekAmerican businessman was kidnapped by the Raisuli in the early 1900s Milius has substituted Candace Bergen and her two children as the victims of the kidnapping and this opens the story to a lot of literary licensebr br On the other hand the movie gives Milius the opportunity to remind the viewer of two of the most famous though mostly forgotten political quotations of the TR era Brian Keith very good as TR says Pedecaris alive or the Raisuli dead and John Huston also good as Sec of State John Hayasks the Japanese Ambassador at a White House dinner You likee knifee you likee forkee,positive

Unfortunately this film 54 was a pathetic attempt of the true story of Studio 54 The only thing that was good about the picture was Mike Myers who was a joy to watch Neve Cambpell although her role was little was unfortunately bad The bottom line is that this film lacked a good performance from the actors except one and that the conversion of the true story was a desperate attempt for a good screenplay,negative
Fay Grim is a true example of what I call a completed puzzle film It has all the pieces of acting direction storyline and entertainment value They all fit together and when done so create a masterpiece Fay Grimbr br This film follows a single mother Fay Grim trying to raise her son to not grow up to be her father who ran away from the law and went missing Soon the CIA contacts Fay in desperate pursuit to find 8 journals of her husband Henrys These journals were filled with confessions of his long past in the CIA and his involvement with countries and their government doings Fay is sent to find these journals in return to release her brother from prison and is sent on a catandmouse chase all over Europe to recover these journals and learn of the hidden secrets of her husbands past she never knew aboutbr br Parker Posey had already been an actress I liked after I watched her in The OH in Ohio and Best in Show She brought liveliness to these two comedic roles of hers but Fay Grim was a far different role than the other two movies Posey made me believe what was happening on screen I felt for her I rooted for her and I wanted to know more She grabs you while she is on screen and when she is off you cant stop thinking about what is happening to herbr br I havent seen any other previous works by writerdirector Hal Hartley but I believe I will look into viewing some of his earlier films if they are half as good as Fay Grim wasbr br If you decide to make a smart movie choice next time you decide to rent a movie or purchase a DVD Id highly urge you to choose Fay Grim If you have any common sense on how a film should be you will enjoy this movie immensely,positive
This groundbreaking film is truly a work of art I went into the screening at the convention in Indiana with very low expectations having already viewed 2 other film with gamer in the title both of which were so bad that by the end of the second one I had plucked out one of my own eyes with my drinking straw and a twisted paper clip I found between the seat cushions But from the opening credits Dorkness had me The temperate Northwest setting made a beautiful backdrop for the drama surrounding the frustrated game master Lodgepowerfully portrayed by Nathan Rice and his misfit band of friends who set aside the reallife dramas they face everyday to face fantastical dramas in the setting Lodge provides for them After the first sceneset in the fantasy world they inhabit They are violently thrust back into the world they so desperately try to escape This drew so many comparisons to my own life that I was moved to tears Rices acting is of such amazing caliber that I truly believed within the first 20 minutes of the film that he really was a twentysomething male suffering from frustration male pattern baldness and an annoying group of friends that cant seem to grasp concepts like right and wrong Lodges friends are of some note here Leo the oldest and heaviest of the trio seems to be the only other character with a job aside from lodge Yet he seems to gravitate socially towards Gary the youngest of the group This seems only slightly odd at first until you realize that Gary is in fact a sexually confused sociopath with very few prospects outside his fantasy world This dichotomy serves not to confuse but to inform and uplift the audience about the importance of diversity in our society My only complaint about this is that the actors who portray Leo Scott C Brown and Gary christian Doyle seem to play the characters for laughs at times as though they were informed they were acting in a comedy instead of a hardhitting actiondrama Speaking of action Brian Lewis makes his film debut as Cass the third and most influential member of Lodges motley crew the tension is always high when he is on screen both when he is arguing passionately about his beliefs to Lodge or when displaying his fantastic Martial Arts skills as Silence his fantasy character Or even when he turns around suddenly to face the audience and you reflexively duck in the audience so as not to get smacked by his fantastic chin Lewis Lights up the screen no matter what hes doing and I hope to see more of him in the future Once the action begins in this movie it just doesnt quit the drama and the action blend so seamlessly at times that you cans tell whether your in the middle of a frenetic action sequence or a touching dramatic moment Truly a thrill ride of Epic proportions I would recommend The Gamers Dorkness Rising as required viewing for anyone who loves film It was almost worth losing an eye overbr br Chip Deedlenick,positive
Walking With Dinoasaurs is a new and exciting programme that uses amazing visual graphics to display the living dinosaurs The information presented here is stunning The moods in the series alter to get your attention things such as dramatic music when fights break out There is clear evidence here for one cracking documentary My greatest thanx to the writers directors and producers and not forgetting the other people involved If you stumble accross this video in shops I suggest you buy it not just for the graphics but for the extreme efforts and productive work the series has to offer 1010,positive
As other reviewers have noted this movie is a cross between ie stolen from stories we have seen before Specifically this looks like Clint Eastwood in High Plains Drifter inserted into Mad Max Remove Clints cigar and replace with a cigarette remove his horse and give him a hightech motorcycle and voilà an updated drifter In this movie the hero is even more blatantly a Savior than High Plains Drifter Now our hero has long brown hair suffers a wound to his left side and his entry into town is preceded by a plea for salvation by the surviving townspeoplea pretty transparent reference to a Second Coming I watched the movie on a hot humid morning Sleep was impossible and upon arising at 430 am there was nothing else on TV So the movie served its purpose While unoriginal with characters that are almost comic caricatures the movie is still somewhat entertainingat least at 430 in the morning,negative
This was one of the best movies I have seen The movie relates to real life and how drugs CAN play a major part Although this movie appears to be produced from a low budget I found it to be exhilarating to watchbr br Some may not like the story and say the script is lacking direction However when a person gets as deep into drugs as these characters there is no direction is life I feel this movie is an accurate representation of what might happen to a person if they are faced with extreme temptationsbr br Most of the cast are newcomers to the industry However they all pulled it off very well Everyone seemed to do their job well and get into character appropriatelybr br I think this movie might be a good tool to use when dealing with a person or loved one that is involved in drugs and appears to be spiraling out of control This movie might just scare them enough to change their ways,positive
I agree wholeheartedly with the comments so far I remember this documentary as being one of the most amazing and informative Ive ever seen As stated before I recall that I began watching thinking it was just another nature study  interesting not necessarily special but I was so wrong Not only was the story of the colony incredible but I remember the music as being so much a part of its appeal If I remember correctly it was Native Americn pipes akin to the music at the end of One Flew Over the Cookoos Nest I too have been looking for a copy This should be required watching for anybody but especially the schools It should be rereleased,positive
I dont leave IMDb comments about films but this this film was bad very bad I fast forwarded through most of it stopping where I hoped the acting had improved since the last scene only to continue with the fast forwards Formula plot  once the obvious murderers were discounted there was only the one left And that was in the first five minutes Scene by scene it felt as though Id already read the script before because there were no surprises no mystery The Tori character bad bad acting A true waste of time on DVD and a definite lets go to bed early option if its the only thing on television If you watch this film you will find yourself realising youll never be able to get back the time youve just wasted,negative
It might be a stretch saying this as a diehard Carlin fan but the material both written and as performed in Its Bad for Ya is some of the best lateera material yet At 70 Carlin bounces back from the level of despair and some of the stumbles in the act itself from Life is Worth Losing to a special that is firmly structured but loose and playful or as much as the old f can get and is continuously ceaselessly funny And funny as in reminiscent of what some of us had going on when watching Back in Town or Diseased the first time The material even if sounding at times a tinge of the previously done ie the whole bit on children in school and camp like the Children segment in Diseased is always fresh and with such a sting of truth to everything that it scalds the mind while here goes tickling the funny bonebr br Going from the topic of death how long to wait to scratch off a name from the book six weeks unless if on the computer scheduler the facets of communication looking down from Heaven spots of God naturally kids and just troublesome gestures involving hats in religion and if people really have Rights make up the bulk of the special centered around the premise that whats bad for you plain and simple is BS Total complete BS which as we also learn or if youve really learned it youre like the kid waiting at the street corner for a week following dropped off notquite randomly by the parent holds the country together Carlin isnt necessarily angry though even if disdain seems to spout out at most turns even just to observe how horrifying childrens teeth coming in look Its skepticism tinged with the feeling that everything is NOT going to be finebr br What it comes down to is this Carlin is to dirty witty cautionary standup comedy what Yoda is to Jedis everywhere which is a small spark of hope via crystal clear wisdom in a world where its pretty damn hard to get any At the least we get classic GC  outrageous lines and bits from the mans 13th or is it 14th comedy special including as far as an eyebrowraising observation on people who play Mozart music during a birth,positive
The movie was very moving It was tender and funny at the same time The scenery was absolutely beautiful Peter Faulk and Paul Reiser gave award winning performances Olympia Dukakis was great I understand due to the story line her part had to be brief but I did wish I could have seen more of hershe is a true proYou will be able to recall experiences from your own life  hopefully in a positive way after seeing this movie We were fortunate to see Paul Reiser at a Q and A after the viewing He is a wonderful man clever eloquent and a real Person It was truly an enjoyable night outThis is a must see movie You will be so grateful you went,positive
Pedantic overlong fabrication which attempts to chronicle the birth of the Federal Bureau of Investigations Begins quite promisingly with a stillrelevant probe into an airplane explosion however the melodrama involving James Stewart and wife Vera Miles just gets in the way Miles had a habit of playing tepid wives under duress and her frayed nerves arrive here right on schedule Esteemed director Mervyn LeRoy helmed this adaptation of Don Whiteheads book but despite the talent involved the picture fails to make much of an impression Best performance is turned in by Murray Hamilton as Stewarts partner however most of the dialogue is ludicrous and the dogged pacing causes the movie to seem twice as long as it is 12 from ,negative
The director is sweet as is his codirecting wife Shira Geffen but their movie sucks It has its moments and some pretty girls but there is too much of everything Amélie meets Breaking the waves meets Pauline at the beach You walk away wanting to know more about the wedding photographer and about the girl who likes it best when nothing happens be it in movies or in real life Instead you get a suicidal writer a neurotic actress and an illegalimmigrantcomesocialworker with a heart of gold It feels like theres more than one truly touching story hidden in the script but at face value its a truckload of wasted story lines and sentimental bullshit Hard to sit out as it is,negative
As it is generally knownanthology films dont fare very well with American audiences I guess they prefer one standard plot line New YorkI Love You is the second phase of a series of anthology films dealing with cities  the people who live  love in them The first was ParisJTaime which I really enjoyed The film was made up of several segmentseach written andor directed by a different director most of which were Frenchbut there is a very funny segment directed by Joel  Ethan Coen Like Paris this one is also an anthology directed by several different directors Fatih AkinMira NairNatalie PortmanShakher Kapuretcand also like Parisdeals with New Yorkersand why they love the city they live in It features a top notch castfeaturing the likes of Natalie PortmanShia LaBeoufChristina RicciOrlando BloomEthan Hawkiand also features such seasoned veterans as James CaanCloris LeachmanEli Wallach and Julie Christie Some of the stories really flyand others dont although I suppose it will depend on individual tastesI wont ruin it for anybody else by revealing which ones worked for me  which ones didnt Word is that the next entry in the series will be Shanghai China is RomeItalyBerlinGermany or AthensGreece out of the question Spoken mainly in Englishbut does have bits of Yiddish  Russian with English subtitles Rated Rby the MPAA for strong language  sexual content,positive
Halloween is a film I have to get out and watch every time its THAT day of the yearI even watch it sometimes when its not the holidayThis film is SO greatJamie Lee Curtis is an actress I can never stop lovingThis movie might be oldbut the story line still gets me right there every timeand the acting was absolutely fantasticAlthough I have not seen the remakeI feel already that it was TOTALLY unnecessaryI think Rob Zombie should have NEVER remade such a classicWhat kills me thoughis to know that there are some people out there who have seen the remake without even hearing of the originalI am getting furious just thinking about itThis movie was greatand it will always be remembered in history as a classic,positive
I really wanted to like this movie It has a nice prison setting conspiracy theories bloodthirsty zombies a perfectly hideous 80stouch and it is a directorial effort by actor John Saxon who also plays a bad you guessed it a bad guy It reminds me of some beloved Italian horror flicks But the direction is very wooden and there is no nightmarishfrightening moment in there It just goes on and on and on and then it logically has to end More suspense and more daring visuals and its destiny as a cult classic would have been sealed,negative
i cant believe that NONE of the official reviews for this movie warn people that it contains two quite upsetting sexual assault scenes Its as though our culture accepts this kind of behavior as simply sexual but not violent My biggest problem with the movie is that it doesnt seem to condemn these assaults  as in the woman who is repeatedly assaulted and pressured never holds the men accountable for their actions and neither does anyone else One man is stopped from completing the assault when someone throws a dagger at him but he is reprimanded only with you cannot force a woman to love you rather than you should never force a woman sexually you jerk From a womans point of view the movie is a let down It sort of throws a bone to women in letting them be both skilled fighters and leaders but the movie is much more defined by the romance  which is characterized by the notion that human sexuality must involve an imbalance of power with men dominating the woman they love This amazing martial arts fighter doesnt use any of her fighting skills to try to fend off her attackers She never even makes them apologize  rather SHE seems apologetic Overall a depressing and upsetting movie with some great cinematography and some cool fight scenes but not as good as Hero by a long shot,negative
The Italian Job requires daylight hours and no experience is required This is a great matinee and a good afternoon at the movies The plot is good but the actual playing out of the plot is very simple and requires no thought process Its car chases explosions and all for the simple purpose of defeating the bad guy played by Edward Norton For Norton it seems he is content to portray the exact same characters as in his previous films such as The Score Mark Wahlberg and Charlize Theron deserve better scripts Warning If youve seen the trailer then you have seen the movie If youre looking for entertainment at inexpensive prices then you need The Italian Job,positive
I did something a little daring tonight when I watched this movie I attempted to wean myself from silent movie scores Sure when this film originally was distributed a piano score was probably played with it Oftentimes the director would choose the score himself Charlie Chaplin often composed the scores of his later silent films But most of the music you hear on VHS tapes over silent films is in no way the same music that was supposed to be played when the film was first released And then again there were plenty of silent films that were played without a score I do not know the history of Potemkins score so I decided to watch it for the medium this piece of art was produced within  film br br Soon after I turned the music off unaided or should I say unimpeded by the musical interpretation of the emotions on screen I became utterly attached to the film Visually it is easily one of the most stunning of all films Eisenstein was a master of composition The editing possibly the cinematic technique Eisenstein is most famous for montage is extraordinary The mood of this film is anger and it stirred my passions violently br br It takes a lot of effort to enjoy a silent film especially a drama but films like Battleship Potemkin prove that this effort is entirely worth it Come on You owe it to yourself to watch this film Your education is incomplete without it,positive
Russell my fav is gorgeous in this film But more than that the film covers a tremendous range of human passion and sorrow Everything from marriage to homosexuality is addressed and respected The film makes the viewer realize that tolerance of other humans provides the route to saving humanity Fabulous love story between Lachlin and Lil I replay their scenes over and over again Anyone who has ever been in love will empathize with these people All characters are cast and portrayed excellently,positive
First off I just want to say that this show couldve done well way better than its doing now What brought it down was certainly the acting Miranda Cosgrove who acts as the main character Carly looked almost worthy of her own show when she was on Drake and Josh Unfortunately iCarly was a big let down Not only can Miranda not act convincingly enough but shes incredibly stiff when she moves She looks as if shes not sure how the character carly would move or stand In the very first episode at the end when she throws the hat up her arm doesnt ever leave her side from her elbow up even when she was dancing she looked like a stick in the breeze And the singing The theme song was great only because Drake had been in it the music was pretty good and Mirandas voice sounded fake I have to admit the plot and settings are good unrealistic but hey thats Nick Theyre practically known for stupid lines and characters But wow is iCarly the worst of them all,negative

br br SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEWbr br The Long Kiss Goodnight is yet another prime example of a common affliction of many modern films it starts off on a very interesting concept  a trained assassin whose memory was erased regains consciousness of herself  and the initial setup is engaging but then it seems the writers dont know very well where to go next and the whole thing trails off down increasingly confusing andor inane paths leaving the disappointing taste of something that was OK but promised to be a lot better The baddies are remarkably unremarkable and even Jacksons comic sidekick turn seems more like something from his prePulp Fiction days it looks like Harlin as in Cutthroat Island made every effort so that noone would upstage his then wife Her character is by far the best of the film and this fact only makes you feel even more frustrated that they werent able to do something better with itbr br However there is still something about this film which for me sets it apart from the runofthemill hollywood actioner and places it above average if only just It is something very subtle I cant quite put my finger on its a disturbing cold dark even sickly edge a nightmarish and unreal feel a decadent air a mean streak which keeps cropping up in various ways Its in the dark reddish photography and almost permanent night the characters dwell in its in Samanthas dreams in front of the mirror its in her vicious eyes and smile whenever shes about to kill a man or when she announces how she will enjoy watching her nemesis die with her daughter listening its in Mitchs comeback at the wheel of a car while he is spurting so much blood from his mouth he can hardly speak I dont know its an atmosphere something I cant define but which gives me the creeps a bit and which makes this film still oddly intriguing for me,positive
I watched this film awhile ago and the only thing i can remember about the film is how absolutely horribly outstandingly bad it was its definitely in my top 5 worst films i have ever seenAnd to think i had to persuade my mates to get this film out at the video shopmy reputation has been shot to bits because of this film will my mates ever trust me againi doubt itthey always say dont judge something by its coverthey were right when i saw the cover to skinsgang boys i thought wow this looks great as it had a load of skin heads on the front cover running riot with metal barsDont WATCH THIS FILMi cant think of anything else to say the acting is bad the story is bad its just bad,negative
I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a whilewhat with all its raving reviews nominations and media attention And I must say the first quarter of the movie was good It really portrayed the black music scene back then However as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits The singing just kept coming one after the other I mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with RENTbr br Furthermore I noticed hardly any character development in any of the characters I just didnt care what happened to them Even when Eddie Murphys character died of a drug overdose I knew I should have been sad but I just couldnt feel any emotion for that character The characters were given a flimsy background about singing in their childhood and whatnot but there personalities were not revealed enough to draw me inbr br Finally the conflict was simply not significant enough to make the viewer care which goes along with the lack of character development This movie reminded me of a copycat movie based on Ray Chicago and Rent Ray and Chicago were wonderful movies in my opinion Overall I think this movie would best suit someone who doesnt really care about an overall story yet would enjoy two hours of entertaining and fun singing performances,negative
Obviously the the responses here were written many years after the film was released and cannot be taken in context Back in 1980 in post labour England this film was bloody funny We were glad of something to laugh about and Rising Damp with its sympathetic mockery of a complete social strata was one of the best British sitcoms of its period if not ever It struck a chord in almost everybody and in true British fashion we laughed at the Rigsby in ourselves America had nothing to touch this type of humour because self debasement was not amusing to our overseas cousins Leonard Rossiter was one of Englands finest actors on stage on TV and in Movies His commitment and professionalism were second to none Richard Beckinsale was although young a perfect comedic foil to Rossiter and should by all rights be classed as an all time great Had he not been taken so young I feel sure he would by now be classified as one of Britains greatest comedy actors Frances De la Tour found her finest television moment in Rising Damp and for me never quantified her undoubted ability with further roles If you did not see the film at the time of its release you are not qualified to comment simply because you cannot understand why it was funny the humour of the moment,positive
From a military historians standpoint nearly everything in this movie is historically accurate Beyond that it is an enthralling story that leaves you depressed at the end but quite glad you took the time to watch,positive

I happen to like Leslie Howard in his better films Yet for some reason his performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously I first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s Howard played the roles supposedly later picked up by Dirk Bogard as the man who was born to be betrayed This is not usually the case off hand I think of Ashley Wilkes as a man who might be betrayed if he and Scarlett OHara were meant to be an item by Margaret Mitchell  but Ashley loved Melonie not Scarlett Howard could play any type and a role like R J Mitchell or Professor Henry Higgins is not one who is betrayedbr br One can make the case that Philip Armstrong Scott is betrayed by the two strangers he shows hospitality to in 49TH PARALLEL but they are Nazis who consider him  a liberal westerner Canadian  fair game to double cross in wartime It isnt the same as emotional betrayal and Howard does not shrivel up as a result but faces the Nazis and captures one after beating him up br br I think what the reviewer meant was that Howard could be soulful  or try to be soulful Witness his poet  dreamer  wanderer in THE PETRIFIED FORREST But that character was not betrayed except by history perhaps as he feels his type is as out of date as the gangster played by Humphrey Bogart The character of Philip Carey in Somerset Maughams OF HUMAN BONDAGE is soulful too He is sensitive for several reasons He has an interest in art and tries to become a painter  but unlike the artist Strickland in THE MOON AND SIXPENCE he has no real talent So he decides to concentrate on medical studies accentuated by a club foot condition he has Here he is a man with low selfesteem who is set up to be betrayedbr br Philip finds that betrayal in the form of Mildred a Cockney waitress Bette Davis who is mercenary and as selfish as they come Why Philip falls for her is not really addressed in the film but he does find the woman fascinating And she finds him an easy meal ticket Ironically in being so captivated by this slut Philip fails to notice two other women who are interested in him Kay Johnson and Frances Dee and are more fit to be his mate He also keeps finding himself forgiving Davis when she has affairs with other men Alan Hale and Reginald Denny  the latter a friend of Howards br br Although Howards performance captures the doormat tendency of Philip towards Mildred he really does not show enough passion until late in the movie when he turns on her That is why I find I never cared for his performance here  it lacks any reality His later tortured insistence in GONE WITH THE WIND that he loves Olivia De Haviland not Vivian Leigh has more consistency with a man in love But the performance of Davis as Mildred makes the film important She had a wide variety of parts up to 1934 like the girlfriend of the deaf pianist in THE MAN WHO PLAYED GOD or the spoiled heiress who gets murdered in FOG OVER FRISCO or the mouselike secretary in THREE ON A MATCH As Mildred she finally showed she could be a major actress by playing a selfish bitchbr br Curiously her performance was not all of one note While she uses and abuses Howard for two thirds of the film culminating in that famous scene where she shows how disgusted his kissing of her made her her last scenes show she too could fall apart due to her health deteriorating and her inability to keep any honest jobs When Howard rejects her the viewers fail to note how equally vicious he becomes he asks what happened to her baby  she tells him the baby died and Howard says brusquely that he is glad which is hardly the response she expects In the end Howard does finally get his life in order but Mildred ends a casualty ironically her death discovered by her old boyfriend Denny on a medical call The Motion Picture Academy of Arts and Sciences did fail to nominate Davis in 1934 leading to the largest write  in campaign in its history and a permanent change in its rules but Davis was established as a star In one year she won the Oscar as Joyce Heth in DANGEROUS And in two years she costarred with Howard again as equal stars in THE PETRIFIED FORREST,positive

In these modern times as subject known quite well to the director of the short film that this German count is going to talk about politically correct films are the leitmotiv of the modern young filmmakers projects Shoulder Arms directed by Herr Charlie Chaplin during WWI the film was released only a few weeks before the armistice is an obvious example of why the early cinema pioneers were a very bold people certainly To direct a humorous film inspired in the terrible bloody First World War was a complicated matter that only few directors with those dangerous and daring ideas could be allowed to do to venture upon such delicate enterprise and with success was reserved only to geniusesbr br As this German count said Shoulder Arms was made during WWI that time in where definitely the whole world lost its innocence fortunately not the German fat heiresses of this aristocrat and it is a hilarious inventive social satire about that and any war The film it is full of great gags and entertaining film continuity for a story in where that tramp will live though risky and courageous adventures in the front whether a hero for the allies or notbr br To mock the war trenches the unhealthiness the frontal attacks and the Germans how you dare by the way there are a lot of inaccuracies in the film  the German soldiers by that time had moustaches and longer beards not to mention that the Kaiser lacks many medals in his uniform in an elegant funny and delicate way it is even today a film miracle impossible of being surpassed Keeping in mind those terrible wartime circumstances the difficult task is only possible thanks to a lot of creativity and talent Obviously Herr Charlie Chaplin had very much of itbr br And now if youll allow me I must temporarily take my leave because this German Count must go back to the Schloss trenchesbr br Herr Graf Ferdinand Von Galitzien httpferdinandvongalitzienblogspotcom,positive
During the whole Pirates of The Caribbean Trilogy Craze Paramount Pictures really dropped the ball in restoring this Anthony Quinn directed Cecil B DeMille supervised movie and getting it on DVD and Blu Ray with all the extras included It is obvious to me that Paramount Pictures Execs are blind as bats and ignorant of the fact that they have a really good pirate movie in their vault about a real pirate who actually lived in New Orleans Louisiana which would have helped make The Crescent City once again famous for its Pirate Connections When the Execs at Paramount finally get with the program and release this movie in digital format then I will be a happy camper Paramount Pictures it is up to you to get off your duff and get this film restored now ,positive

While there is a lot to recommend about Maetel Legend both in concept and finished product its ultimately a poor film Plot wise its a retelling of Maetels early life which is usually unclear at the same time the writers take the opportunity to tell the story of the Machine Empire And since Leiji Matsumoto has trouble not including his other work we get a starting point for Emeraldas her sister Her mother the Queen of La Metalle and a bit of Galaxy Express 999 to flesh out the filmbr br In short Maetel is a princess on the planet La Metalle a planet with an irregular orbit thus meaning its cycle around the nearest sun is reaching a cold stage and its artificial Sun is dying The Planet grows increasingly colder throughout the story thus increasing the sense of doom In order to protect her subjects and family the Queen decides that mechanisation is the only way to ensure survival of La Metalles people Enter Lord Hardgear a robot  cyborg who provides the means for the job Through the film the characters are left to question mechanisation will they still be human Can Hardgear be trusted Do souls and hearts remain So for a fan of Matsumotos work theres lots to enjoy questions to be answered themes continued except its obvious that the film is meant to be an introduction as well as a fan curiosity The negatives foremost the animation while Galaxy Express 999 a TV series from over 20 years ago has shoddy mouth animation and at times sketchy character design Maetel Legend has all the worst traits of modern animation and thus earns an air of respectability to Galaxy Express 999 The design is well detailed but unfortunately the animation has suffered leaving well drawn characters that slide as in the backgrounds move or the camera zooms a quick way of animating However the few yes few well animated scenes are re used over and over in dream sequences repetition and in extra scenes Anyone whos seem the film will wonder how many times Lord Hardgear can drink the same glass of winebr br Next the story While in concept everything sounds great the finished product is in fact a series of conversations of plot which are repeated over and over to little effect the number of times the characters encounter the same problems and learn the same things is practically insulting to the audience and the characters which are seemingly much more articulate in former incarnations Add to all of that some terrible character design that seem lifeless over exaggerated and the audience is left with a movie so miss handled it might as well have been rewritten as a different film at least the newcomers wouldnt be left baffledbr br And yet it really has its moments the ending at least is surprising The plight of the citizens of La Metalle was quite affecting and rightly disturbing I guess I find that whole manmachine theme distressing Its hard know who to recommend Maetel Legend to since its not well animated written or executed plus confusing once Leiji Matsumotos mandatory crossreferencing is introduced However I cant help but brighten up when the magnificent entrance of ThreeNine occurs now thats good cinemabr br 15 stars out of 5 2 if youre a fan,negative
I am a fan of Ed Harris work and I really had high expectations about this film Having so good actors as Harris and Von Sydow is always a big advantage for a director but if the script is bad what can you do I really think that Needful Things is the worst movie of Harris filmography and that getting involved with it was a huge mistake Anyway Ive seen much worse movies in my life but Needful Things was a disappointment because of the waste of acting talent The story as an overall seems too unbelievable and fake I dont know if that is because of the book cause I havent read it But if the script was so bad I cant see the reason for filming it Maybe it was the commercial success of Kings books or the need for lowquality movies for the VHS era of the 90s Whatever the reason was though this movie was a very bad choice for anyone involved,negative

Ordinarily Anthony Mann made westerns with the big guys  James Stewart Gary Cooper Henry Fonda    the A list cowboy stars But in this B film he tackled something notably different and had quite a bit of success with what turned out to be a truly one of a kind western The main character played by Victor Mature is a trapper mountain man and ordinarily they are romanticized in films  Robert Redford in Jeremiah Johnson that sort of thing where the hero is not in fact a typical mountain man but a clean cut heroic figure who hangs out with real mountain men Not here For once a true mountain man  vulgar crude animalistic  is the central figure and its something to see giving Mature one of his better later roles The real acting chops are provided by Robert Preston excellent as a selfabsorbed Custer type cavalry commander and James Whitmore the poor mans Spencer Tracy as another of those old timers who feel themselves trapped between ever more hostile Indians on the one side and the oncoming force of civilization on the other Even more impressive is a very young Anne Bancroft as the officers wife who is initially repulsed by the very sight of Matures grisly character then finds her own veneer of civilization slipping away as she begins to realize to her own shock that shes attracted to him Rarely if ever has a remote frontier fort been so accurately realized on screen without the romantic allure that John Ford gave such a place in his masterful Fort Apache The battle sequences are big scale and notably violent and particularly impressive if you seen them in widescreen format Good show and underrated movie all around,positive
With this movie I was really hoping that the idea was to make up for the hashed together ineptitude of the first AVP and yet to my horror Requiem is far worse than I could have imaginedbr br My hopes were up in the opening moments of the film inside the Predator ship and I almost breathed a sigh of relief when we finally saw the Predator home world a throwaway digital matte painting but still nice to finally see it and then of course the humans if such poorly written characters can be referred to as such are introducedbr br One must wonder why it seems to be impossible for Fox to make a good film out of Aliens and Predators At the very least the supposed filmmakers could have done their homeworkbr br Characters are set up in the same manner in which we would expect from the worst Friday the 13th Sequel The pizza delivery scene was cringe inducing as was every other scene of character interaction that followed it Bimbos and teen non actors do not make for a REAL film they make for a cheap flick and Alien 13 and the Predator movies were good because they were produced above the concept remember that the 1st Alien is a B movie done as an A movie The Strause brothers really missed an opportunity that could have been rectified by simply knowing their AlienPredator roots In both the Alien and Predator films we are introduced to characters that are part of a larger group Alien Refinery workers Aliens Marines Alien 3 Convicts and in the Predator films we generally follow a main hero part of a unit Predator ArnoldSpecial forces Predator 2 Danny Glover Police and its easy to see where the filmmakers of both franchises started to go wrong in Alien Ressurrection we have piratesor something AVP we haveexplorerswith guns and of course in AVPR we have teen slasher clichés What is there to identify with here In concept the idea of a convict returning to a small town and a war vet returning seemed a set up for a First Blood type of action hero but like many things it was never paid offbr br The Filmmaking is equally devoid of rhyme of reason There is no sense of forward momentum to the action just small sequences that build the most minuscule levels of tension or interest only to cut away just when theyre getting interestingtaking the audience out of the movie at every turn The action scenes themselves though much ballyhooed in the trailers are so darkly lit it is literally impossible to tell what is going on during the fight scenes when they finally occur Basically the movie is hindered from many levels Bad actors combined with poor direction and an atrocious screenplay which as a screenwriter myself I noticed seemed to hit every wrong note and cliché that only the most untalented writer devoid of ideas could have hashed together The WRITING if it can be called that is not even direct to video quality nor does it demonstrate a shred of respect for the established lore of the previous entries in the series Why does the Predalien all the sudden have the ability to shoot alien embryos down a pregnant womans throat to use her as an incubator for chestbursters More than likely because the brain dead screenwriter needed a way to have more aliens for the predator to fight and given the accelerated growth time even more so than the first AVP as quickly as possible Why must meaningless small talk between cardboard cutouts on sticks meaning the supposed characterssubstitute for real character development Remember a character is defined by what they DO not SAY Why is the Sheriff leading civilians to a cache of guns isnt he an officer of the law How does the bimbo of all people know where they are Why does the Predalien wait for the Predator to VERY SLOWLY remove his mask before it attacks Why are the aliens still falling into that nasty seriespostAlien 3 habit of hissing all the time to let their prey know to run How on Earth did this series devolve to a character saying People are dyingwe need guns how this writer even works is beyond me and reflects badly on Foxs already destroyed artistic reputation Its like everyone involved in the making of this film suffered from a mental impairment or really are that inept at every level of the filmmaking process br br The EFFECTS are pretty lousy this time around The Aliens look like men in suits and ADI is just getting lazy with their creature design The Aliens look like modified leftovers from Alien Resurrection with that same bulky musculature around the arms as if they did not learn from that movie that it was not a good design nor a good one to recycle Again everything is shrouded in such a state of darkness not to create mystery or atmosphere but simply to hide how bad the creatures look And just like in AVP Stan Winston is sorely missed when the fake looking Predator face is revealedbr br There are too many faults to list so I will just say this Do not waste your money on this movie Fox is beyond caring about the fans as this cheap and trashy film is clearly evidence of I felt bad having taken my girlfriend to see it though it was free and apologized to her profusely after This is one diehard fan who is done with the franchisebr br Note to Fox What we really wanted wasnt a mindless slasher flick it was a film adaptation of the original Darkhorse Comicbook which was better than anything youve produced for this franchise post 1993br br

Bucks role as The Kahn brings to mind Bob Barker of The Price is right running a country the same way he runs his show But theres lots more to chuckle and snort through in this turkey Kurt Thomas as the babyfaced hero displays some considerable acrobatic skills but not a whit of acting talent whatsoever Theres a few spooky moments in the Village of Crazies mostly and some mildly impressive martial arts sequences But any given Ninja movie will give you much more entertainment and you wont feel as guilty about laughing,negative

While not quite as good as A Murder is Announced which was not only delightful but almost surpassed the book this is an excellent adaptation And you know what it is a huge improvement on the Geraldine McEwan version Now I dont take pride in bad mouthing the Geraldine McEwan adaptations two or three of them were surprisingly good but others started off well but ruined by either a poor script a confusing final solution or both The Geraldine McEwan version suffered from a plodding pace and both of the above problems and I would consider second worst of the ITV adaptations worst being Sittaford Mystery which even on its own merits turned out dull and confusing This adaptation of the book Nemesis is a huge improvement it not only respects the book despite a few liberties but it pretty much rectifies the problems the ITV version had Despite the added character of Lionel coming across as rather irritating more to do with how he was written than how he was acted and one or two moments of sluggish pacing this is solid as an adaptation of a decent book It is beautifully filmed with nice photography and period detail and the music as always is excellent The performances are wonderful this time around and make the most of an in general welldone script with Joan Hickson brilliant as always as Miss Marple and solid turns from Liz Fraser Helen Cherry Joanna Hole and Anna Cropper Margaret Tyzack is outstanding though in a chilling and moving performance as Clothilde Overall well worth watching better than the recent version in pretty much all departments 910 Bethany Cox,positive

I give the show a six because of the fact that the show was in fact a platform for Damon Wayans as the Cosby Show was for Bill Cosby it dealt with a lot of issues with humor and I felt that it in fact tailored to getting a laugh as opposed to letting the jokes come from the character br br Michael Kyle An interesting patriarch and a wisecracking person He is PHENOMENAL in movies but in the show he was there for the wisecrack and though I loved it I felt that the laugh was more important than plausibilitybr br Jay Kyle I have loved her since House Party and have enjoyed her in School Daze and Martin this was a great role for her and she made a great choice in picking this sitcom to costar in I also feel that Jay and Michael were more like equals in the show but Jay was more the woman who fed her crazy husbands the lines and went along with his way of unorthodox discipline because she may have felt that it workedbr br Jr Just plain stupid his character should have been well developed and even though he does have his moments of greatness we are returned to the stupidity as if he learned nothing which drives me nuts Not to mention that most of the situations in episodes Ive seen seems to center around himbr br Clair The attractive sister who dated a Christian I found her boyfriends character to be more interesting than she was shed be better off sticking to movies the writers should have done more to show her intelligence but its not stereotypical enoughbr br Kady Lovable and the youngest daughter I think the writers established her character most on the show aside from the parents and Franklinbr br Franklin I LOVE this character and I think they derived it from Smart Guy TJ Mowry which only lasted one season They did a great job of casting for this little genius the effort would have been made if Jr would have been the smart one but show the down sides alsobr br All in all this sitcom is a wonderful thing and its homage to the Cosby Show is well done I love the show and wished it would have stayed on longer than that I cant wait to see the series finale,negative
And I love it Wonder Showzen will pick up a cult audience and once its canceled the DVD sales will go though the roof This is a very funny show in its own ways Its a parody of childrens shows namely Sesame Street Our puppet characters consist of Chauncy a yellow furry monster with a hat whose our host Clarence is a blue lizard like thing that does his own segments where he goes out on the streets Him is a weird dog like thing that refers to himself in the third person Wordsworth is the smart one whose brain always shows Then theres the newscaster and the pink puppet Its a very funny show not really as nasty as youd expect but more the situations They take 7 year olds out on the street tell them what to say and have them make mean jokes that they dont understand My favorite segments are Clarences videos especially when somebody doesnt want to be filmed I prefer TV Funhouse which was a similar show but this is still a very funny show that I hope lasts for years to comebr br My rating  14 out of  30 mins TV MA,positive
I dont really post comments but wanted to make sure to warn people off this film Its an unfinished student film with no redeeming features whatsoever On a technical level its completely amateur  constant unintentional jump edits within scenes dubbing wildly off etc The plot is completely clichéd the structure is laughable and the acting is embarrassing I dont want to be too harsh Ive made my share of student films and they were all awful but theres no reason for this film to be out in the world where innocent fans will have to see itbr br Safe assumption that  much like the cast  positive comments are filmmakers friends and family,negative
Scary in places though the effects did leave something to be desired unless you have bad eyesight or are afraid of the dark However most of the acting was convincing and most of the effects were well done I thought the creature looked a bit too much like a man in a gorilla suit for my liking It reminded me of the original pink panther film,positive
I liked this film very much The story jumps back and forth quite a bit and is not easy to follow There is no resolution to the story whatsoever and you are left to wonder what really happened Since I like that sort of film I enjoyed this I especially like the dating scenes between the boys and I was drawn into their lives And of course any film with a naked Staphane Rideau will get a couple of extra points ,positive
This made for TV film is about every cliché you can come up with for a disaster movie The only problem is it isnt very well donebr br My brain is still insulted from the scenes in which Brian Dennehy is supposedly looking at a computer monitor looking for weather pattern data and showing on that monitor are stock footage scenes of weather turmoil ala The Weather Channels commercials Why would watching local news footage of a washed out sidestreet give insight to global weather patterns You got mebr br Also interspersed through out the first two hours are some of the worst CGI effects known to man Watch for the semi truck and the airplane that look like they were rendered on a Commodore 64br br All the foreshadowing in this movie is done with the subtlety of a sledgehammer the dialog is forced and I cant think of a likable character that I want to survive the second halfbr br The character I hate the most is the stupid wife whos husband is cheating Maybe if she lifted a finger at anytime during the show instead of being a helpless woman who stands in the the same 10 square feet of the kitchen all day her husband wouldnt be sleeping with the PR rep for a rival energy company She is so helpless in fact I want to put her out of her and my misery I hope everyone in this movie dies in the second half,negative
Why oh why dont blockbuster movies simply stick to their selling point Everyone in the cinema young and old was there to see talking animals make jokes and whilst they did that we were all happy And then as with Lost In Space came the two killer blows  plot and sentiment Who really cared what happened to the tiger or whether Eddie Murphy made up with his daughter Not me thats for sure,negative
For getting so many positive reviews this movie really disappointed me It is slow moving and long At times the story is not clear particularly in the evolving relationships among characters My advice Read the book its a fabulous story which loses its impact on screen,negative
Titanic directed by James Cameron presents a fictional love story on the historical setting of the Titanic The plot is simple noncomplicated or not for those who love plots that twist and turn and keep you in suspense The end of the movie can be figured out within minutes of the start of the film but the love story is an interesting one however Kate Winslett is wonderful as Rose an aristocratic young lady betrothed by Cal Billy Zane Early on the voyage Rose meets Jack Leonardo DiCaprio a lower class artist on his way to America after winning his ticket aboard Titanic in a poker game If he wants something he goes and gets it unlike the upper class who are so concerned with their social worries The two fall in love and the audience sees the sinking of the Titanic primarily through their eyesbr br The movie begins in modern times with the exploration of the wreck by a group searching for treasures that sunk with the Titanic which has recently occurred One of the survivors of the Titanic Rose DeWitt Bukater who had heard of the exploration of the wreck on television and is flown to the boat where the search is being led from to tell of what she remembers to help the search She gets to telling her memory of the one and only voyage of the Titanic With this the scene shifts to Southhampton Ireland where the Titanic set sail from on April 10 1912 as all the passengers are boarding After another stop on the Irish coast Titanic went out to see on its maiden voyage across the Atlantic bound for New York Historically the first few days of the voyage went by uneventful but the fictional plot of the story is developed during this time as Rose sees the hopeless entrapement of an engagement that she is in to the wealthy Cal Hockley and falls in love with third class passenger Jack Dawson Captain Smith alledgedly as shown in the movie was urged by the White Star Line Director to increase the speed of the ship so they would make the newspaper headlines and receive extra publicity by arriving in New York on Thursday night and not on Friday morning as planned Smith then ordered the fateful decision going against his thirtytwo years of experience to stretch the Titanics legs out to full speed The Titanic had reports that the waters in the Atlantic they were sailing in were full of icebergs but they ignored these warnings and proceeded at full speed as shown in the movie On April 15 1912 at 1139 an iceberg was sighted They attempted to shut off the engines and turn the ship out of the path of the iceberg but there was not enough time and the ship hit the iceberg on the starboard side as depicted in the film The portrayal of the many small holes in the side of the ship and not one large gash along the side is accurate The crew of Titanic sent out distress calls and set off distress rockets as shown until 218 when the lights finally failed The lights of the California were spotted six miles away but they failed to realize what was going on and did not respond to Titanics many pleas for help The California had tried earlier in the day to warn Titanic of the severe ice that had caused them to stop their trip but Titanic had brushed them off causing the California to turn off its radio and leave the Titanic on its own The first class women and children were the first as depicted to be put into the twenty lifeboats that were on the ship Overwhelmingly the third class passengers suffered the most amount of deaths of any class and the crew was hit hard in this tragedy too The word of White Star Line employees and first class passengers was believed over that of second and third class passengers when authorities were trying to gain information of the sinking Also the metal that was used to build the Titanic has been found in recent years under conditions of severe cold which were experienced the night Titanic sank to be extremely brittle Overall the basic plot is very accurate in its portayal of the events and the times at which these events took place on the Titanicbr br Many of the characters in the story were not real and created simply for the purpose of the movie or as composite characters to represent possible characteristics and ideas of people on the ship The core group of Rose Jack Cal and Roses mother all were fictional characters added into the story as they represent different groups of people from the time Yet many characters such as the Unsinkable Molly Brown Captain Edward Smith the ship designer Thomas Andrew the White Star Line Representative Bruce Ismay and all of the Titanics officers were real The maiden voyage was going to be Captain Edward Smiths last voyage anyway as he planned to retire afterwards He had been a part of the White Star Line since 1880 where he worked his way up to his status as the Millionaires Captain when the Titanic sunk The portrayals of the officers is accurate as only four survived the tragedy except for the officer who threatened to kill all of the passengers of the ship with his pistol He is on record as acting heroicly and was misportrayed to the point that James Cameron apologized and evoked a monument in his honor in the officers former Canadian hometown As shown in the movie there was a language problem between the crew and many of the lowerclass passengers from nonEnglish speaking nations In addition Officer Lowe was the only officer who came back in the lifeboat as depicted The old people shown in their bed as the water came in their room were based on the Strauss Not wanting to leave her husbands side Mrs Strauss refused to get in her lifeboat and died with her husband on the Titanic Furthermore Mr Goggenheim who was shown sipping his brandy and smoking a cigar reportedly did go out like this dressed in his best The richest man on the ship John Jacob Astor who owned most of Manhattan died nonetheless as well but his much younger wife was saved in a lifeboat In addition Molly Brown was saved and later had medals made up for the crew of the Carpethia that picked the survivors of Titanic up from the water Her ticket on the Titanic had cost over fourthousand dollars and by the end of her life she ended up broke All of the interiors of the ship were masterfully replacated down to the last pieces of china and silverware The gymnasium which is hardly seen is recreated perfectly with all of the machines reproduced to match those seen in old photographs The wonderful outfits and costuming were an excellent recreation of the PostVictorian era of 1912 The rich at this time practically ruled everything as the womens suffrage movement had not quite gotten moving yet Women during this time often married for financial security as Rose was considering doing and normally took a back seast status to their husbands as Cal wished for Rose to do The rich did not take well to new money such as Molly Brown as depicted Everything of the time was very formal Women had to be escorted to dinner by a male figure as seen with in the dining scenes Smoking was not very common among women of the time but holders of cigarettes which were just coming in at the time were used as seen with Rose in the movie Men of the time generally smoked cigars not cigarettes Women were constained physically by their corsets and socially by society Although James Cameron had no background in historical films he brought in experts of Titanic coupled with two years spent crossreferencing the history of the Titanic and few liberties were taken The beautiful cinematography and special effects also helped to make the film even more breathtakingbr br A recognizable message can be seen in the movie Titanic as the people on the ship had about three hours to contemplate their demise The director James Cameron shows the various reactions to this time of crisis in peoples lives Everyone reacts differently and he gets you to think of how you might have reacted had you been in that situation on the Titanic on that fateful night In addition this film is a reflection of the 1990s when it was produced as it gives a look into the wreck of the Titanic Only in the past fifteen years has the site of the actual Titanic been found and explored This movie was able to give us a deeper look into a disaster that many would not have viewed However the moral question of whether people today should be taking treasures from the wreck of an underwater graveyard is posed There have been attempts to stop treasure seeking missions such as the one portrayed in Titanic but all have failed As it stands today anyone can make a voyage to the Titanic and take whatever valuables they as portrayed in the film showing the general values of our time on this matterbr br Technically the film is very well done To get footage of the wreck at the bottom of the ocean it took twelve dives to get all of the footage needed for the movie In addition a special camera had to be created to withstand the intense pressure at the bottom of the ocean Cameron did not plan on using the probe to go as far inside Titanic as anyone has in the 88 years since the ship sunk but it worked out that this provided an unique perspective into the ship Furthermore throughout the film fade ins and outs from the wreck of Titanic to the scene of Titanic during its actual voyage This shift between the modern scene to the past scene during the voyage works as an excellent transition that makes the story easy to follow in aclear manner At the very beginning of the movie a septune recreation is used to recreate the scene when the actual people left the European coast on Titanic giving it distinction from the rest of the events of the filmbr br Titanic plays almost like a historical biography and is like a work of art a true epic Like most history novels we know the ending but it doesnt take away from the wonderful treats that can be found in this picture Certain aspects of this film are Academy Award material including costuming sound cintematography and editing If you like interesting characters that will give you an insight into the life of characters in the early 1900s and how they face disaster then this movie definitely is for youbr br ,positive

One of Starevichs earliest films made in France is possibly his only political satire The story of The Frogs Who Wanted A King mirrors its title as a group of high croakers feel that democracy has gone flat so they demand a king from Jupiter to rule their land When he sends down a stump the frogs ask for another king saying the stump is but political timber Jupiter sends down a hungry stork this time whose frog lusty eyes devour the towns residents As the original croaker is about to slide down the storks beak he speaks his moral let well enough alone This film features a few beautiful crowd scenes of dozens of puppet frogs Starewicz tricks the audience into believing they are all moving at once by keeping the background in constant motion and animating only about six frogs or so at one time The slightly corny dialogue and problems with lighting in a few places diminish the quality of repeat viewings however its historical significance in Starewiczs life make it of importance to watch His feelings towards government immediately following his flee from Russia are likely expressed in this film In addition the technical accomplishments of animating so many characters at once in a stopmotion film is astounding,positive

First of all what is good in the movie  Some pretty actress  the exotic background  the fact that the actors dont laugh while acting I would have if I had been in their situation  I dont know The storyline is simple  a catholic priest who does abstract painting tries to find out who another abstract painter killed his little brother a male prostitute raped by another priest when he was young Im afraid there is nothing here to learn or to let think a little about serial killers art or religion Dennis Hopper is not very good here This is the worst episode of the worst season of profiler the serie with replacement actors and unbelievable coincidences the uncle is the policeman who the girl who lives at another victims house could have a baby with the priest etc etc,negative

Following my experience of Finland for slightly more than a week Id say this movie depicts the nature of the Finnish society very accurately Especially the youngcouplewithababyhavingseriousissues phenomenon is very familiar to me as I witnessed the exact same thing in person when I was in Finland The relationships and problems of people fragility of the marriage institution the drinking culture unemployment and the ascending money problem all are very well put without any subjectivity or exaggerationbr br There are some points in the film that are not necessarily easy to comprehend and tie to each other but the joint big picture is nonetheless rewarding Not each one of the short stories is exciting or profound but as said above the big picture does not fail to deliver the feeling of real life and captivate the viewer I happen to think in a calm moment What is happening in the lives of all these people on the street Well this is what is happening Movies like this are good to feed your imaginative power It would be safe to assume this film could apply to the life in many countries but it particularly reflects Finland as it is and pretty damn wellbr br One comment about the acting Being the fan of Finnish cinema I am Ive never seen any of these actors on any other movie but I found the acting in this feature right next door to perfect overall Maybe not a masterpiece but a very good try by the entire crew Ill be keeping an eye on the future releases of the director and the castbr br 75  10,positive

Wow I just dont even know where to begin with what made this movie so awful Maybe I should start by just saying that during a heated confrontation between the antagonist and protagonist I had to leave the theater because I was laughing so hard Yeah The acting really was that bad The acting was not even the worst part though The plot was almost entirely shown in the previews The characters are all grossly underdeveloped The dialogue and dramatic moments are ridiculous The bad guy is a caricature of an out of control power drunk sadistbr br But hey the actors are pretty so guess that was supposed to make it all better,negative

Need I sayits a stinker I gave it a rating of 2br br Only watch it if you suffer from insomniabr br Theres plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie There is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroines well being A few disagreements slight raising of voicesthats pretty much it The secrets are nothing that couldnt happen to anybody  the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that pointbr br The plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named Faith Meg Tilly who is an artist who is hired to paint a series of mural panels in a huge ballroom in a vast mansion by a very very wealthy older widowed woman and a growing motherdaughter type relationship that the older woman craves with herbr br It turns out the older womans daughter Cassandra is dead You can pretty well fit the rest of the pieces togetherbr br Even the scene with the mysterious man menacing our heroine does not advance to the point where you really fear for her safety beyond maybe a second or two Why hes still hanging around years after Cassandras death is a good questionbr br Theres also the question of the fact that in this vast mansion there is only one servant a faithful butler who seems to do everythingcooking cleaning serving the meal answering the door etc Everything except apparently locking the doorsince that would be the only explanation for how one of the characters just walks into a room where Faith isbr br Theres nothing that will have you grasping your chair arms and leaning forward on the edge of your seat because there IS no mounting tension in this filmjust bland pathetic revelations that get tossed out from time to timebr br ,negative
Rollerskating vampires Im sorry but even for the 80s thats just way too cheesy to be remotely scary You can excuse the original the odd kitsch moment because it was parodying old movies and TV shows but thats been done once so the sequel needed to be a little less camp not even more outlandish Plus the first movie had the presence of Chris Sarandon  a man who could even make stalking discotheques in casual knitwear seem seductive  that this one sorely lacks so there was no danger in anything that happened it just seemed sillybr br Admittedly I only saw this once when I was 7 but by then already being a huge fan of the original I remember being disgusted To me there is no sequel to Fright Night just a tacky spoof that doesnt deserve any appraisal whatsoever,negative
This was indeed an amazing adaption I missed the first episode so I unfortunately missed out on the bonding between the characters and the smooth flow of the storyline But as soon I watched the second and then the third instalment I was just blown away I ordered the DVD less than a week later and unable to wait for it to come I went straight out and brought the book From the moment I opened it I was hooked I just couldnt put it down I decided to finish the whole book before I dare watch the DVD at all I preferred the book because it got inside the characters minds you could understand totally where they were coming from and what there role was within the story They missed a lot out of the adaption which was disappointing as the book is a master piece and I think they could have done it superbly if they had been able to stretch it over a longer period of time But considering only being able to be fitted into a 3 hour slot I think it was done excellent It followed the main twisted storyline brilliantly And the actors which were enrolled as the main characters where amazing The love making scene was pure beautiful It was so tender and loving and just showed how natural homosexual love can be I was totally blown away with both the book and the TV adaption I loved both of Sarah Waters previous novels and also found the Tipping the Velvet adaption quite enjoyable But when I read and watched Fingersmith I knew none of her previous novelsadaption could beat it Sarah Waters has indeed exceeded herself this time I recommend that you watch this adaption If Tipping the Velvet wasnt your thing then dont let it put you off this one Fingersmith is a whole new ball game It is a beautiful yet dark twisted story about love greed and betrayalbr br A MUST SEE,positive
The Jazz Singer is one of a number of films made in the late 1940s and 1950 about the Jewish experience in the United States Other than Crossfire1947 and Gentlemans Agreement1947 which dealt with antisemitism they usually had a musicaltheatre background These films included The Jolson Story1946 Jolson Sings Again1949 The Eddy Duchin Story1951 The Eddie Cantor Story1953The Benny Goodman Story1956 and Margorie Morningstar1958 The leading actors in these Jewish films were always played by nonJews For example Larry Parks a nonJew played Al Jolson and Gene Kelly played Noel Airman in Marjorie Morningstar This casting was probably done to make the Jewish theme palpable to a mainly nonJewish audience The Jazz Singer1952 is no different Danny Thomas was a devout Catholic and Peggy Lee was certainly not Jewish although she plays a nonpracticing Jewess in the film The clue to her background is when she attends the Goldings family meal before entering she says I havent been to a sader passover service since I left homebr br The film is about a cantors son who has just left the service after seeing action in Korea His dilemma is whether to become a cantor a family tradition or to be a singer in musical theatre His choice of theatre leads to an inevitable conflict with his fatherbr br However there is much more to this film than this This film was made after the Rosenberg trial during the McCarthy whitchhunts and the Hollywood blacklist Therefore in this film the Jews are shown as good loyal citizens andbr br are quintessentialy American The synagogue choir would rather play baseball than practice The cantors friends also talk about baseball in fact one of them is a Major League umpire The synagogue itself dates back to 1790 and George Washington is said to have visited Therefore Jews are presented as part and parcel of American society Nobody in this film has a Eastern European accent Peggy Lee appeared in very few feature films In this film you get to see her sing Lover and Just One of Those Things wonderful Danny Thomas is quite credible and he acts and sings the part very well The comedic routines could have been left out Yes the film is schmaltzy and sentimental but it is well worth seeing I enjoyed it very much,positive

So then this is what passes as high art for the likes of SXSW Film Festival and Sundance eh Well I suppose I can relate as long as story script dialog acting save for Ms Aselton cinematography and editing are completely irrelevantbr br I remember telling other filmmaking friends some years ago that the biggest problem with digital video was that we were now going to have to wade through a future sea of crap to get to anything worth watching now that anyone and his brother or brothers in the case of the Duplass could run out and make a movie The Puffy Chair Need I say morebr br This feature length video is yet another chapter in the dismal everexpanding world of dudeology movies young guns armed with a DVX100A a few thousand dollars a hastily written shallow script and some friends they call actors who decide one afternoon to make a movie and voilà instant feature videomakers Dont get me wrong  Im all about independent cinema ie Hollywierd sucks But having said that you cant argue with some of the realities of that system br br If the Duplass Brothers wouldve had to have gone out and raised a real budget and bring on real producers its clear a script like this would never have been greenlighted And therein lies the problem There is no longer such a thing as a vetting process for getting films sorry videos ready for production Just grab a DVP2 camera and off you go And what makes it worse is that highprofile festivals like the aforementioned actually embrace and encourage this kind of nonsense And why Precisely because its nobudget br br I think its important especially in todays climate of indie films to quit allowing videomakers to highjack the language by labeling themselves filmmakers There is quite a difference in my book When you have to go out and actually put your script on the line asking friends and family or business people for real money to make a feature film knowing the potentially losses at stake then you will know what it means to be a filmmaker But dropping a few hundred at Sams Club for some DV tapes some soda and chips doesnt cut it br br Oh and by the way I have to mention how utterly annoying it was to listen to a female being addressed as dude throughout the entire movie Even Mark Borchardt reserves that intenselyoverused moniker for his male friends only where it is at least endearing where his buddy Mike is concernedbr br I think its high time the indie film community started to call out these shoddy nobudget videos for what they are and simultaneously scold prestigious festivals for giving such casual efforts high praise Either that or ask these festivals to at least have the courtesy to add a new category to their festival line ups Dude Films,negative

Without a doubt this is the big momma of all music videos Unlike most music videos that are either dance videos badly storied andor badly interrupted lyrics this was done right Jackson was cowriter and by evidence of VH1 heavily choreographed and directed this masterpiece In fact you could say Thriller is creepier then most horror movies with that last second sparkling eye To me this music video is what you judge all other music videos on You can easily see the ominous influence MJ had on early breakdancing with the zombie march number Because of the dancing comedy storyline and yes horror I give it a 5 of 5,positive
eXistenZ is an exploration of reality and virtual reality wherein characters run from realm to realm landscape to landscape trying to beat a game they know not the goal of or exactly where its leading them Within that virtual reality game is more layers of virtual reality games calling into question which reality they arrive from is the real onebr br Of course its not spectacular at hiding the fact that its not going to reasonably answer to a true reality instead tossing the idea of whether its real or a video game into question even up to the end Im not even sure Cronenberg pretends that twist wont be there its so incredibly obvious in a sense its kind of disconcertingbr br The problem with this film though is its base nature in a sense Cronenberg is questioning reality AND criticizing game play Yet the same things that he uses to criticize game play makes him revel in it the violence the discontinuity the lack of focus and in a sense the pixellation even if there isnt such pixellation in the film I have once heard someone state that Cronenbergs violence is actually a criticism of hyperviolence in media but he hides that well with the fact that he derives such incredible pleasure in ripping new orifices into humans animals and amorphous piles of biological sludgebr br What IS brilliantly written and done about this movie is the use of video game conceits not being able to say exactly what you want to say during cut scenes relative lack of surroundings or surroundings that dont make sense only a few people around where it feels there should be many and viceversa all of that stuff along with the motif of penetration It definitely deconstructs the video game reality in a way thats nauseating and absurd but it does it even better by replacing video game electronics with literal pods of biological matter that squirm and shift and are frankly disgusting to the one of the most horrifying degrees For what its worth this film causes a reaction in youbr br But what for It criticizes virtual reality but its a movie it is its own virtual reality It seems to criticize the banality of video game plot lines and character design yet it maintains that banality It definitely seems to worry over whether killing a video game character is more okay than killing an actual human being and how video games can be confused with reality and cause people to not think about the consequences of their actions in real life and yet I say again it derives the utmost pleasure from ripping people objects beasts things and organisms into bloody shredsbr br So whereas it has a key focus of angst it doesnt really do anything with it not really Only what it does do is present that angst in such an original way it cant really be denied its own moment of splendorbr br In a sense itd be much easier to just hate this movie for being gory and violent because theres no good reason I can see for loving it and yet I cant disregard it as mediocre or bad Itd be easier to simply not be able to take it but since I can theres nothing I can really do with it I do believe it is a little excessive it really didnt need to go as far as it went but Cronenbergs intentions are so mixed up and confused I dont know if that was Cronenbergs flaw or Cronenbergs point and I dont think theres really any way to figure it out except maybe ask him directlybr br PolarisDiB,positive

Geesh I never ever ever thought Id write the above four words But actually shes the highpoint of this little flickbr br As the movie was packaged when I rented it it supposedly is a comedy about a girl who is kidnapped but doesnt have her medication which keeps her stable It sounded like a cute concept For years all we ever saw of Spelling was as Donna Martin in 90210 and an endless parade of dull lifeless TV movies It sounded like a chance for her to stretch a little and considering that with her TV success and her rich daddy she couldnt have any financial reason to do this movie I figured she took the part because this must be a lowbudget jewelbr br Wrongbr br Instead Spellings part is small and the bit about the mentally unbalanced kidnap victim is just one of several storylines When shes not on the screen the movie crawls so badly I couldve sworn it was longer than the 85 minutes that were listed on the tape This wouldve worked so much better if Spellings storyline had dominated and it had been changed into a romantic comedy with her and Phil the least irritating kidnapper,negative
Just lovely It is long No climax Dont wait for anything to happen Great for a rainy day About a man in a mid life crisis who takes his family to a secluded area of the Greek isles I saw this in my teens and still love it 20 years later I have been unable to find it in video stores however Molly Ringwald is a cute average teenager who basically wants to go home and then kind of settles into the place There are no phones no TV boredom which when hit with quietness like that the human condition is to be bored and then to reflect And each character does so Susan Sarandon plays a beautiful woman who wants to be sexually involved with John Cassavetes character but he is unable to well you know Gina Rowlands is the wife that loves him but is just about to give up on their marriage He is demanding and frustrating to everyone There is another character in the movie a Greek who talks to Molly Ringwald inappropriately about sex but things that she is curious about But he is irritating and horny and i didnt like this character The locale of the film is what makes this film so so good It wouldnt work if filmed anywhere else I recommend this film and give it a 9 on a scale of 1 to 10,positive

Inspired by True events Radio is one of the best acted heart felt dramas I seen widely released in sometime It definitely is one of the years best films of 2003 br br Radio stars Ed Harris who is Oscar worthy nonetheless in this film as football coach Harold Jones Coach Jones has been teaching football all his life and loves the game However Coach Jones does not spend much time with his wife and daughter played by Debra Winger and Sarah Drew One day Radio played by Cuba Gooding Jr in his best performance since Men of Honor comes by the football field while the coachs team is practicing for the game Some members of the team then tie up radio and throw him into a building They then bang on the building and finally Coach Jones suspects something is wrong He comes over and helps Radio who is frightened and from that point on Coach Jones and Radio shares a very special bond Radio becomes the highlight of every football game and really enjoys participating in the football games and at school events He also becomes Coach Joness main interest in life over football which at first was his main priority before both his family and Radiobr br The movie deals with all sorts of real life problems including what your priorities are life accepting people for who they are even if they are different death and family relationships The movie touches upon all those issues and more and is extremely well done and director Michael Tollin should be very proud of this film The thing I liked most about Radio was how real it felt The performances were like watching something in real life occur right before your eyes Radio had a great mix of comedy and drama Some parts were quite funny yet other parts were very serious and sad br br In conclusion I feel that Radio was very overlooked by Critics only getting average reviews They must have there heads up there butts because its amazing how this film can only get 2 star reviews and something like school of rock can get 3 or 4 stars it doesnt make any sense to me Also the performances as I mentioned before are topnotch and Oscar worthy In my opinion both Ed Harris who I think is underrated as an actor and Cuba Gooding Jr should both get some kind on nomination for this movie Radio is one my favorite movies of the year and gives me reason to still see some of the big Hollywood movies My final rating for Radio is a 910,positive
I am not a huge fan of camp kitsch and the so bad its good type of viewing However I really like this film for its fun factor and  believe it or not  its innovationbr br The whole thing has a ring of John Waters and is boundlessly enthusiastic but with some superb actors and considered direction making the most of the slapstick and styalised movements Billy Zane moves with incredible expression see the scene on the bus for a textbook lesson in how to use movement and is framed by some unexpected starsbr br You may not like this film you may not enjoy it but if you get the chance to watch it then spare the time because chances are you will end the film with a confused smile on your face and a new perspective on the sense of humour of some big stars Highly reccomended,positive

Piece is Cake is defeatist revisionist history of the worst kind whose only point is to unfairly savage the reputation of the admittedly fictional pilots it portrays It left a remarkably bad taste in my mouthbr br In the March 1989 Aeroplane Monthly Roland Beamont wrote a stinging condemnation of the way that RAF Fighter Command was portrayed in the TV miniseries A few of his comments are worth repeatingbr br There was no sense of defeatism at any time in any of the squadrons that I saw in action and a total absence of the loutishness portrayed in Piece of Cake It would not have been tolerated for a moment The prevailing atmosphere was more akin to that in a good rugby club though with more discipline Nor was there any sense of death or glory RAF training had insisted that we were there to defend this country and now we were required to do it  no more and no lessbr br There was no discussion of bravery or cowardice People either had guts or they did not  but mostly they did But we knew fear recognised it in ourselves and in each other did our damnedness to control it and then got on with the jobbr br I could feel no glory but there was a sense of greatness and none of this bore the slightest resemblance to Piece of Cakebr br Beamont was in his own words a fighter pilot who unlike the author and producer of the recent TV series was there at the timebr br Beamont served with 87 Squadron both in France and the BoB before going on to become one of the premier exponents of both the Typhoon and Tempest and a postwar test pilotbr br Piece of Cake is an absolute total misrepresentation of the way pilots in Fighter Command acted at the time It is nothing less than a complete and utter disgrace,negative
dont read any plot summaries because in words the plot might seem trivial braindead and pointless The film is excellent the acting by both Denzel and Dakota she will go sky high trust me on thatare just fabulous and the plot is mind blowing Actually fabulous is a small word to use for such talented actors The film is just based on actual facts and some characters are not fictional a fact that adds up to the shock that i was having during and after the film If you are fond of both actors and of somewhat deranged films you still havent watched your favorite one yetTrust me in the end you will have a weird and inexplicable feeling The film is awesome see it rent it buy it or whateverjust dont miss it,positive

Before seeing this film I suggest the viewer puts away any expectations that the victims of the crimes depicted will get equal treatment and consideration as the perpetrator There have been many films about crime victims This one is about the murdererbr br Dead Man Walking finds realism in simplicity of the story there are no crack lawyers coming to save William Poncelet and no dramatic story twists The film does not attempt to put him in a good light he is guilty he is repugnant is a racist and was responsible for heinous murders Given all this we are asked to do something very difficult look at him as a human being despite his crimes In this way the film challenges the notion that the death penalty provides justice Whether you are for or against the death penalty the film raises questions about whether the guilty can find redemption inequity in the justice system and the appropriateness of the death penaltybr br Great performances by both Susan Sarandon and Sean Penn In particular the last moments of the film show the true depth of Penns ability,positive
This adaptation positively butchers a classic which is beloved for its subtlety Timothy Dalton has absolutely no conception of the different nuances of Rochesters character I get the feeling he never even read the book just sauntered on set in his too tight breeches and was handed a character summary that read Grumpy broody murky past He plays Rochester not as a character or as a real person but as an over the top grouch who never cracks a smile until after he gets engaged at which point he miraculously morphs into a pansy There is no chemistry The only feeling that this adaptation excited in me was incredulity and also sympathy for Charlotte Bronte who is most definitely turning in her grave GO AND REREAD THE BOOK ROCHESTER HAS A PERSONALITY AND BY THE WAY A PASSIONATE LOVE SCENE DOES NOT MEAN YOU HAVE TO EAT HER FACE,negative
For those expecting the cover art and story outline to indicate another entertaining Bollywood Indian production beware no musical dance numbers or songs of production value exist to brighten the mood in this rather tired story of arranged marriages in the British Indian culture  with a few variations thrown in As written by Roopesh Parekh the script jumps around topics worthy of discussion only to cover them up with routine avoidance tactics Harmage Singh Kalirai directs like a traffic cop trying to hold together the disparate subplots to the point of Keystone Cop tacticsbr br Jimi Chris Bisson is a medical school student who is gay and has a lover Jack Peter Ash and they live with Jacks obese alcoholic loose morals aunt Vanessa Sally Bankes and Sallys chubby daughter Hannah Katy Clayton Jimis family is visited by the Patel family from Delhi who bring their beautiful daughter Simran Jinder Mahal to England to find a husband Jimis parents Saeed Jaffrey and Jamila Massey and his grandmother Zohra Sehgal decide Simran is the girl for Jimi to marry and arrange an engagement and wedding in the custom of Indian ways  without consulting Jimi Jimi discovers the plot and is too spineless not to go along with it a decision which enrages Jack and infuriates Vanessa Hannah tells a little lie to Simran that she is Jimis daughter and the wedding is off When Jimis parents visit Jimis house they discover the drunken Vanessa are repulsed by her but eventually decide that for Jimis happiness they will go along with the fact that Vanessa has given them a granddaughter and decide to use the marriage preparations as a wedding for Jimi and Vanessa Jimi convinces the very reluctant Vanessa to go along with the idea and before long Vanessa is dressed in a sari prepared for a wedding and Jimi terrified at what he is doing just to please his parents includes Jack as his best man At the wedding the truth comes out and to Jimis surprise his family adapts to Jimis true self and the day is saved by simply being truthfulbr br The cast copes with this silly bit of nonsense rather well and there are some good performances Chris Bisson and Peter Ash are attractive men and play their roles well albeit without any indication at all of a loving relationship the director seems terrified of showing the least suggestion of intimacy between the two men Sally Bankes provides most of the laughs as Vanessa the rest of the cast repeat the stereotype roles theyve played countless times in Indian movies This is not a bad film  it has its moments  but it is just too superficial and tired to make us care about any of the characters,negative

Blue Desert may have had the potential to be even a halfway plausible and more enjoyable thriller had the main character Lisa Roberts Courtney Cox not been so stupid When she is the victim of another attack on the streets of New York comic book artist Roberts moves to a small town out West In her first days there she meets the suspiciously crazy Randall Atkins Craig Sheffer playing this part well who will eventually not leave her side Fearing for her safety after having been in the situation already twice before she strikes up a friendship and relationship with the suspiciously amicable town cop Steve Smith DB Sweeny whos character does not seem convincing enough leaving disbelief among viewers who should otherwise be convinced of the red herrings thrown by the writers Smith needs Roberts cooperation because as he tells her Atkins is an excon and guilty of sexual assault But the cops have lacked the evidence to put him away beforebr br The movie had enough ploys to at least make an interesting movie because soon enough there is such confusion as to whom Roberts should trust However much of the intended suspense appears too forced because Roberts character never seems to react to simple things as we think any reasonable person might And her delayed responses allow much of that suspense to occur to easily and unconvincingly particularly in the finale Perhaps Sweeny was the wrong choice for this role too baby faced in ways that kind of recall Kevin Andersons persona evident in his character in Sleeping With the Enemy Or if Lisa Roberts was written as a stronger character this might suffice as well In the meantime the film is not all that great even as a lowbudget Bthriller,negative

Smartly written well acted intense and suspenseful This show lives in the real world not as fantastical as is 24and I am a huge fan of 24incidentally It has believable characters and in many ways is much smarter than most in this genre It tries to present both sides of Islam So far I have watched the first 4 episodes and find the story to be more evenly balanced The terrorists are more complex and not one dimensional And as a result of that balance the terrorists become more frightening than the typical villains being portrayed in film and on television Last but not least the hero is truly heroic without being a cartoon I recommend this show for anyone who is a fan of 24 and the like,positive
I totally disagreed with those comments which said this is a good movie This is a totally SUCKED movie I mean SUCKED  SUCKED The story development is strange Mia Kirshner changed from an innocent girl to a partyfun seeking chick for no convincing reasons at all In addition all the actresses looked way too old for being college students  College students looked like about 30 years old  you figure out the rest I watched only about first ten minutes and started fast forwarding to look for sex scenes all the sex scenes are lame hasty and most importantly no frontal at all All the sex scenes are laughable considering how many clothes they had on Do yourself a favor  put it down and save yourself a few bucks Conclusion Story  0 Sex  0 Acting  0 Score  0 out 10,negative
Not only does the films author Steven Greenstreet obviously idolize Michael Moore but he also follows in his footsteps by using several of Moores Propaganda filmmaking tactics Moore has expertise in distracting the viewer from this focus though while Greenstreet is obviously less skilled herebr br Having been privy to all of the issues surrounding Moores speech at UVSC I was disappointed to see that the major complaints of the community  that Moore was being paid 40000 of the State of Utah s educational funds to basically promote John Kerrys campaign and to advertise his own liberal movie  were pushed to the background by Greenstreet while lesser issues were sensationalizedbr br The marketing methods for this video have been equally biased and objectionable promoting the film by claiming that Mormons tried to kill Moore Not only is this preposterous but it defames a major religion that Greenstreet obviously has some personal issues with I followed Moores visit very closely and all of the major news agencies noted that Moores visit came and went without any credible security problems or incidents in Utahbr br Greenstreet has banked on this film to jumpstart his filmmaking career to the point that he has even dropped out of film school to help accelerate this This seems to have been a severe miscalculation though since Moores visits to roughly 60 other colleges and Universities across the country in 2004 diluted interest for this rather common event Greenstreets assumption that American audiences would be interested in this film due to the promoted religious and conservative angles doesnt seem to be well foundedbr br Even the name of the film This Divided State is somewhat of a misnomer since Utah voted overwhelmingly for Bushs reelection and thus appears to be more politically unified than any other State The division in the movie title seems more indicative of the gulf that exists in Greenstreets ideological differences with his religion and State If anything I find a humorous correlation between the religious angle of this supposed documentary and Woody Allens hilarious contention in Sleeper 1973 that I was beaten up by Quakers,negative
Fred was such a great showIt was simple but somehow very addictingI can still remember the days when Id watch this on Kids WB Saturdays but then Kids WB did the unforgivableKids WB became like that older relative that tries to act hip and funky freshshudderThey became like that relative who tries to act all cool but the attempt is a cheesy disasterThey pulled Coconut Freds Fruit Salad Inland and all the other good shows to put on some of the most pointless shows Ive ever seen In my lifeJohnny TestThe only thing that keeps me watching KWB anymore is the occasional bits of the old shows and the anime on 4kidsIt was such a huge mistake to pull this show off of the scheduleThis brings me back to my first point BRING IT BACK,positive
I expected a comedy like the Big Mama movies Instead the movie was a bizarre mix of comedy drama and a love storybr br This movie has three plots The first involves Madea and her taking in a foster child The second involves a woman who is engaged to a rich man who is abusing her The third involves a relationship between a single mother with 2 children and a single fatherbr br There is actually very little comedy in the movie There are also a number of very twisted messages in the movie For example Madea beats the foster child with a belt in a comedic manner to convince the child to straighten out The child does in fact turn herself around Apparently it pays to beat childrenbr br There are plots dealing with child rape with the consent of the mother There are scenes with old men ogling young girls who are related to them The ogling takes place at a family reunion The movie jumps from plot to plot such that you are always offbalance Is this a comedy a love story or a drama It is in fact nothing  except a waste of time and money,negative
When I was a teenager seeing this film for the first time I thought it was one of the best movies ever made Of course the reason for that is Bo Derek and her various states of undress in this film However now that Im older I can honestly say that this film is awful Mind you Bo Derek is absolutely incredibly beautiful and she and husbanddirector John Derek make sure you see plenty of her But when you take that aspect out of the film it becomes one big dull ride And Tarzan well hes all muscular like you think he should be but when he sees Jane thats Bo of course for the first time he doesnt know what to think This despite the fact that Bo is wearing a wet seethru shirt with her breast prominently displayed Tarzan would be the only primitive man on the planet who would have that problem If you are looking for a movie to slobber over a beautiful naked body then this might fill the ticket If you are looking for a thoughtful entertaining and worthwhile film go elsewherealmost anywhere else at that,negative
For a long time The Menagerie was my favorite Star Trek episode though in recent years it has been eclipsed by City on the Edge of Forever What I used to prefer about Menagerie was that its more hardcore Star Trek with this fascinating backstory to the thencurrent Trek storyline I still think its fairly ingenious the way Gene Roddenberry incorporated the original pilot into a twopart episode Though the new part of the story is largely an excuse for Kirk and a few others and us to watch the pilot the idea of Spock being courtmartialed is a clever one You can poke holes in the plot if you want For instance given the Talosians mindcontrol abilities and Captain Pikes condition why is it even necessary to physically bring Pike back to their planet And there are other confusing questions about Pike and Commodore Mendez best to not think too hard about the details and just enjoy STs only twoparter,positive
Oh you pilots are such men They dont call it the cockpit for nothing honey Dialogue like that is just one of many reasons why The Concorde Airport 79 or if you saw it in the UK where it dragged its heels getting released there Airport 80 The Concorde was the last and by far the least of the series The disaster movie was in dire straits in the late70s what with The Swarm having offered much unintentional hilarity and Beyond the Poseidon Adventure When Time Ran Out and City on Fire simply offering much boredom and the desperation to find a new spin on the genre is all too apparent here This time its a conspiracy plot with Susan Blakelys news anchorwoman discovering billionaire boyfriend Robert Wagner has been selling arms to terrorists and the North Vietnamese Naturally she decides to tell him everything rather than make the story public but he fobs her off by explaining Im a very rich man I have everything in life I could ever want Why would I jeopardise that by doing something so incredibly stupid Just in case she doesnt buy that line rather than say hire a hitman to kill her on the ground he decides to do things the smart way by planning to destroy the Concorde while shes flying to Moscow via Paris Ive done a lot of things Ive been ashamed of but I am not a murderer he insists indignantly on his way to reprogramme a guided missile to destroy the plane So nothing incredibly stupid there And when that fails he sends a jet fighter after it And when that fails br br Dont even think of looking for anything resembling logic here this is real bottomofthebarrel stuff that even the studio gave up on and marketed as a comedy in the US after critics laughed it off the screen Where the previous three entries all had the look of glossy bigbudget entertainments this smallscreen friendly effort the only one not to be shot in 2351 widescreen doesnt even manage to make the Concorde look good which is quite a feat TV veteran David Lowell Rich presumably got the directing gig because he was fast cheap and had previously directed TV movie SST Disaster in the Sky where Peter Graves supersonic airplane found itself unable to land due to sabotage and Senegalese flu which was not intentionally at least a comedy despite the presence of a young Billy Crystal in the cast and seemed like the natural choice for what looks like a 14m TV movie that somehow escaped into theatres when noone was lookingbr br Cast like a bad episode of Hollywood Squares stars are in very short supply this time round and most of the few vaguely familiar faces seem to have been rounded up from rehab clinics and busted sitcoms Alain Delon gives the Hollywood career that one last shot as the pilot Happy Fish dont ask George Kennedy moves from the executive suite to the copilots seat in the hope of reminding people of the other movies while the rest of the ensemble includes a couple of veterans of The Towering Inferno Wagner and Blakely a softporn star Sylvia Kristel

goodwill tour of the States who knew about the boycott Just to add a touch of The Simpsons to proceedings Harry Shearer voices one news report in the same tones hed later use for Smithersbr br Highlight Despite the impromptu wedding ceremony during a crash landing it just has to be George Kennedy diverting a heatseeking missile by opening the window sticking his arm out at nearly twice the speed of sound and firing a flare  while the plane is upside down And then Alain Delon turns off the engines so there wont be a heat source for the missiles to home in on Yes someone actually got paid for writing this and that someone was future Oscar winner and screenwriter of Munich and The Insider Eric Roth hey everybody has to start somewhere although in his defence it was producer Jennings Lang who came up with the plot Still what do you expect from a film that credits stunt balloonists and ends with a shot of the Concorde flying off into the sunset Amazingly in one of those wont admit defeat moments studios used to be prone to Universal shot another 20 minutes or so of footage a couple of years later to include in the network TV showings not included on the DVD Sadly its boxoffice failure led to the fifth entry in the series the laughriot that would have been Airport 1984 UFO never getting off the ground Even more genuinely tragically it was the Concorde used in this film that crashed in France 21 years laterbr br Oh and if youre wondering what Charo says to her Chihuahua in unsubtitled Spanish when its not allowed on board its What do you think Dont worry When

This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings The performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic An interesting exploration into family relationships and environments,positive

Anna Ursula Andress is brought in as an official RN by exlover Benito Varotto Duilio Del Prete ostensibly to nurse an aging widower Count Leonida Bottacin Mario Piso back to health after a heart attack But Benito is actually leading a group of heirs and businessmen including American entrepreneur Mr Kitch Jack Palance with ulterior motives reflected by what Anna hopefully will actually accomplish with the Count He has a history of well liking women and would be actually a bit more vulnerable as he is cured The bad guys get derailed as Anna does not go along and grows closer to the Count The ending might be said to be ironic but it is probably better described as predictable br br But so much for plotthis film is totally an erotic comedy from start to finish and oh how good There are many nude scenes including ones of Anna and Jole one of the malevolent heiresses played by Luciana Paluzzi Both Ursula and Luciana are noteworthy continental exBond women and thus fulfill the fantasies of male viewers As she did in Thunderball remember Fiona Volpe Luciana plays a femme fatale sort of although less elegantlybr br Perhaps the best scene is Annas slow complete strip and jump in bed with the young Adone the other patient who incredibly is resisting in an attempt to find out what he knows about the plot But even at this point she is already twofaced for the better for she has decided not to go along However Benito is more than a twotimer with women having had lengthy flings in the past with both Anna and Jole and the rival best erotic scene follows an invectivefilled to put it mildly argument between him and Jole This is a standingup encounter in which Luciana is down to black panties only Another nice one is Ursula swimming fully naked in the estates pool The Count is free as the client to put his hands wherever he wants to on Ursula and he takes advantage Hey somehow Ive gone back to the actresses names in my descriptions Erotic scenes involving other women include an amusing naked wine cellar chase The Sensuous Nurse is compact 77 minutes but it doesnt need to beit is enjoyable without interruption start to finish Definitely recommendedbr br ,positive
This movie was absolutely ghastly I cannot fathom how this movie made it to production Nothing against the cast of the movie of course this is all the fault of the writing team You take the old average plot  lets dance our way out of being poor and destitute  or STEP in this case But this one lacks any semblance of a true plot  or at least one that anyone would care about With Canadian speaking actors in what is supposed to be an American setting  this film falls very flat On a positive note the directing was pretty good and cinematography was pretty decent as well Looks like the production budget was very generous as well My only request is that this team leave the writing alone and go find actual screenwriters to help them bring words alive on film Net result  How she move is How she sucks,negative
I enjoyed this film It was lighthearted delightful and very colorful You can see that MGM was showing off Technicolor There are hardly any colors that do not appear in this film Every scene is packed full The choreography was great Gene Kelly is a wonder He is so talented The dance numbers in this film are all perfectly executed and perfectly designed He understands that the dances can tell the story as much as anything else The last section of the film the grand dance sequence is very impressive What makes this film very special is Gershwins music Few American composers have had a better gift for melody I very much enjoy Gershwins music It is enchanting Ira Gershwin is definitely one of the greatest lyric writers He is so witty and charming This was a highly entertaining film,positive

This was perhaps the worst movie Ive seen in a long long time Forget that its clear no research was done regarding Detroit forest in downtown Detroit Bwahaha The writing was horrible the premise completely implausible and quite frankly the characters were embarrassing I cannot for the life of me understand why seasoned actors would stoop to such a low and participate in something this god awful Now I have never seen the original and dont know if this movie pays tribute to its original form Its my understanding that the original was not set in Detroit Why they would deviate from that without researching details about the setting only tells me that it was more than the cast that was looking to pay the rent br br Dont waste your time on this junk unless youre from Detroit and wish for some comic relief,negative

I think that this film has become an important record of the most horrifying aspect of the East German regime  the imprisonment of its people by what the regime called its antifascist protective wall It is a document of desperation and courage not to be missed I would however like to comment on the actual location of this escape It did not happen in or around Berlin as supposed by some respondents and was nothing to do directly with the Berlin Wall The escape balloon was flown over the Iron Curtain which not only divided Germany but it divided the whole of Europe at that time The balloon took off from Pössneck 170 miles southwest of Berlin in the German Democratic Republic East Germany and flew 14 miles to Naila in Bavaria and freedom in West Germany The opening of the Iron Curtain in Hungary in 1989 preceded the fall of the Berlin Wall later that year Whilst the balloon flight created entertaining suspense cinema it should remain as a monument to those who lost their lives whilst attempting to escape from East Berlin other parts of the GDR or other Sovietcontrolled states,positive

1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies Friday The 13th and The Burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like Dont Go Into The Woods Alone and this one But in all fairness The Prey is nowhere near as bad as Dont Go Into The Woods but its still not great either One thing is that its just boring and acting isnt very good but much better than DGITW and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning One thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it just seemed pointless and it looked as the director used that to just used that to fill up some time spacebr br So what was there to like about this movie Well there were a few laugh out loud cheese moments I couldnt contain a fit of giggles when the final girl did a bizarre type of backwards moonwalk to get away from the kille and there were a few good kill scenes my favourites being the girl suffocated to death with the sleeping bag and the phoney lookingbr br All in all The Prey is dumb boring and the killer I didnt find scary at all this movie could have been a whole lot better,negative

Silly comedy casts an embarrassedseeming Ray Milland as a British officer in World War II Europe escaping German confines and taking up with a manhungry gypsy woman played by Marlene Dietrich Slowlypaced overlong and miscast the leads are far too old for this type of juvenile fodder although Marlene shines in her solo moments It took three scriptwriters to adapt Yolanda Foldes book for the screen but this material must have already seemed dated by 1947it smacks of something Ernst Lubitsch might have turned out in 1939 The scenario is musty and the stars have absolutely no chemistry together  from ,negative

I have to say that this is one of the best movies I have ever seen I was bored and looked through the tv and found Home Room and it was already in about 5 min but I got hooked It was so interesting and moving It shows what can happen in anyones life I give it a 10 more if possible The director writer and actors did an amazing job I think teens should watch this movie and will learn from it It was great drama mystery and more I cried for hours I think that the director writer should write more movies like this one I loved it I didnt even know about this movie which is sad because it was so good I wish it could go in the movies for more people to see,positive
I have to say the first I watched this film was about 6 years ago and I actually enjoyed it then I bought the DVD recently and upon a second viewing I wondered why I liked it The acting was awful and as usual we have the stereotypical clansmen in their fake costumes The acting was awful at best Tim Roth did an OK job as did Liam Neeson but Ive no idea what Jessica Lange was thinkingbr br The plot line was good but the execution was just poor Im tired of seeing Scotland portrayed like this in the films Braveheart was even worse though which is this films only saving grace But seriously people didnt speak like that in those days why do all the actors have to have Glaswegian accents Just another film to try and capture the essence of already tired and annoying stereotypes I notice the only people on here who say this film is good are the Americans and to be honest I can see why theyd like it I know they have an infatuation for men in Kilts However if you are thinking of buying the DVD Id say spend your money on something else like a better film,negative
A wonderful cast thrown into modern mystical romances for the intellectual grown ups Yes they too need a love story to stir those hidden urges without the Hollywood fluff This all under the masterful direction of Antonioni and Wenders who both love to pin his characters in exotic locations and have them dwarfed by the surroundings with long wide shots It is great to see that there is lust in the midlife crises sector,positive
This is one of my favorite series all categories all timebr br I was fortunate enough to get a hold of the whole series on VHS a few years ago I loved it when I saw it back in 91 92 when I was about 12 I love it as much or more today which is remarkable considering my hopefully improved film appreciation and criticism skills Most of the movies I liked back then Im not that fond of today besides for the nostalgia factor That factor is present here as well but theres so much more to Robin of Sherwood than nostalgiabr br There are only a few bad things about this series First the picture and sound quality is soso at least in the first couple of episodes Fortunately it gets better Secondly you could have wished for a bit more blood and realism in the fighting scenes although I know that was not an option in this casebr br So on to the good things And there are a lot of them First of all Michael Praed IS Robin Hood I dont think I have seen him in a single role since then which only strengthen this fact for me He delivers such a believable performance as Robin Jason Connery had an impossible task replacing him The fact that Michael Praed hasnt become a bigger name as an actor is unbelievable Or perhaps that was his fate to do this one role perfectly then disappearbr br I love Nickolas Graces Sheriff of Nottingham He is really not a complex character but totally rotten The relation between him and Gisburne is just hilarious Actually just looking at de Rainault sitting in his throne bored glaring makes me laugh even before he has said anything Another actor that deserves extra praise is Ray Winstone as Will Scarlet You can really feel the sadness inside of him as well as his hate for the soldiers who killed his wife Winstone is an actor that finally has gotten his well deserved Hollywood breakthrough in films as The Departed and Beowulf There are a lot of other great actors here toobr br I love the portrayal of the Robin gang They are having fun playing laughing you really get a feel of the camaraderie between them the closeness that comes from a tight bound group such as this Those bonding scenes are so importantbr br I think that it being UK produced with British actors really made it better compared to for example the 92 feature film version with Kevin Costner that just feels fake fake fake Christian Slater as Will Scarlet come on The cast being able to speak English with British accent makes it more believable and I get the feeling that the actors as well as the director and writers behind the series can put themselves much more into the shoes of the Robin Hood gang than an American crew could have The music is wonderful Clannad is perfect for the feel of the series The music is another of those things they just nailedbr br An exciting addition also is the fantasy and magic spice that is put in there Its not over the top but believable and just makes the whole thing better and more interesting I also love how nicely the mix of comedy adventure and drama is blendedbr br Those are a few of the things that makes this series so alive and so genuine Its by far the best Robin Hood version I have ever seen I wont wrap up with the Nothings forgotten quote But one thing that never will be forgotten for me is this fantastic Robin Hood retelling See it,positive
I searched out this one after seeing the hilarious and linguistically challenging Clueless 1995 perhaps Alicia Silverstones best known effort from early in her film career True Crime has Kevin Dillon which should be helpful in improving most film projects In fact everyone in the cast does a good job  The only disappointment I think the movie has for me is an awkward feel to some of the scenes coming from the need to run a quite uncompromising grown up theme as part of what in tone starts out as a schoolgirl adventurebr br Alicia Silverstone is pretty good in this one She carries off well the naive enthusiasm and growing unease that affects Mary Giordano as she manoeuvres towards the truth behind the serial murders I reckon her characterization of MG has some mileage in it too The inference of the story line is that she goes on to a career in law enforcement It could be really interesting for an older Silverstone to revisit Giordano at a time of crisis later in the officers life Just a thoughtbr br True Crime shows its director in a good light Pat Verducci also has the writing credit I dont know of any other film work PV has done I can only wonder what happened after such a promising startbr br Like most productions this one has a largely unknown supporting cast although Bill Nunn Detective Jerry Guinn is hardly that Over the past decade he seems to have been able to secure an impressive number of screen appearances I recall seeing him recently in Carriers 1998 a made for TV presentation with a military theme Bill Nunn played Captain Arends Fans of the classic US TV comedy show Whos the Boss may also have an interest in Carriers because the leading player is Judith Light remembered with affection by many because of her lengthy involvement with the showbr br True Crime could easily not have worked but it does OK I think it is an entertaining story worth seeing,positive

Perhaps because I was so young innocent and BRAINWASHED when I saw it this movie was the cause of many sleepless nights for me I havent seen it since I was in seventh grade at a Presbyterian school so I am not sure what effect it would have on me now However I will say that it left an impression on me and most of my friends It did serve its purpose at least until we were old enough and knowledgeable enough to analyze and create our own opinions I was particularly terrified of what the newlyconverted postrapture Christians had to endure when not receiving the mark of the beast I dont want to spoil the movie for those who havent seen it so I will not mention details of the scenes but I can still picture them in my head and its been 19 years,negative

What an ambitious project Kenneth Branagh undertook here and how well it was realized This is the first filmed version of Hamlet to use the full text of Shakespeares play but Branagh didnt do it just because it was there His intention I believe was to make the play accessible and understandable to the general viewer without dumbing it down so to speak In return he asks viewers to put in a little work themselves a fair enough proposition and one thats a bargainbr br The setting is a generic 19th century European one and this does more than work well it keeps a modern or ancient look from possibly distracting from the work itself The production design and cinematography and both outstanding which helps immensely when youre watching a fourhour movie Branaghs casting once again is inspired and the acting is likewise The direction accomplishes the heavy task of making this a movie rather than a deluxe version of a play Since so much of Hamlet is based on interior monologue and there are relatively few duels battles etc this can be a daunting task But everything Branagh tries to do seems to workbr br Branagh has always been one of the most interesting actorwriterdirectors if not always the best since he made his big splash with Henry V One quibble I had with him was what I saw as a tendency to ham it up at times In his portrayal of Hamlet here he might be accused of that again but there is a method at work Lets face it Hamlet is not an easy work for the average person to understand and if one has never seen it performed before he or she needs help even if theyve read the play Hamlet has the most lines of any Shakespearian character and Branagh makes sure that his viewers know what this man is thinking and feeling throughout the film even if you dont know the literal meaning of every arcane word This performance by Branagh was at the very least worthy of an Oscar nominationbr br There are so many other outstanding performances here theyre almost too numerous to mention but some of them must be acknowledged Derek Jacobi as Claudius is superb but even he takes a back seat to Kate Winslet when it comes to handing out praise Her portrayal of Ophelia is awesome in its depth of feeling made only more outstanding by the knowledge that she was only about 20 years old at the time She looks to me like the finest young actress around Other super performers in no particular order are Richard Briers Nicholas Farrell Michael Maloney and Reece Dinsdale and Timothy Spall as Guildenstern and Rosencrantz respectively Honorable mention goes to Julie Christie Charlton Heston and Robin Williams who manages to do his thing here successfully Even Billy Crystal as a gravedigger works The one cast member who doesnt inexplicably is Jack Lemmon In the very opening scene he appears and while the other three actors do a great job at setting the tense mood Lemmon sounds like he is just running lines in rehearsal as a favor You know this must have been a real dilemma for Branagh since everything else about the movies screams out that its the work of a perfectionistbr br Not to be facetious when speaking of a fourhour movie but it does seem just a tad too long Some monologues and conversations do tend to go on a bit if I may be so bold and a little bit of judicious pruning would be welcomebr br Did I forget anything other than Patrick Doyles score No doubt I did Ill just sum up by saying that Kenneth Branagh may have made the definitive film version of Hamlet and it will be a truly monumental production that tops this one,positive
A few weeks ago I read the classic George Orwell novel 1984 I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books Ive read recently So when I rented the DVD I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up Unfortunately the movie didnt even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Orwell so masterfully did in his book The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do John Hurt the main actor is droll the entire way through and hardly does any acting until the end We never really find out what he does for a living or why his love affair is forbidden or what the political climate is and why the main character desires rebellion This book cannot be done justice in movie form without proper narration and explanation of the political system oppressing the characters and the fact that those are missing is the greatest shortcoming of this film Besides that John Hurt was a terrible casting choice looking about 15 years older than the 39 year old Winston he was supposed to be portraying On a more positive note however the rest of the cast was well chosen Its just too bad they were put in such a horribly adapted film with the wrong lead actor Brian O,negative
First of all the nature in the movie is beautiful and there is a bit of Mongolian music Well the horses looked Mongolian and the camels but thats about all what was Mongolian in it Oh Borte is played by a Mongolian actress albeit a lame performance But she is pretty which redeems a bit the lack of performance on her partbr br But I totally failed to understand what was the point of this painfulto watch piece of 130 hour fantasy created by MrBodrov The plot totally lacked any sense of cohesion There was no logic behind the development of the plot In fact there was hardly any story at all just a number of loosely tied scenes with a bunch of guys in Mongolian clothes speaking some kinda pidgin that is supposed to sound like Mongolian Most actors were either Japanese Russian or Chinese most scenes were shot in China Kazakhstan or Russia and there were a lot of disturbing pathos about what is it to be a Mongolian The dialog is primitive and the scenes with dialog are slow The battle scenes are laughable All the supernatural pathos is lame and is obviously there only to make up for the lack of the storybr br The Japanese actor was like a wooden doll and looking at him one wouldnt get any idea how this person could become a leader who could unite the nomadic tribes He looked sleepy soft stiff and pitiful for the most part of the moviebr br And I dont even want to start on the subject of the historical relevance of this piece of cinematic waste To see Chinggiskhan half of the movie as a slave to see his two first kids be born from other men to see his wife selling herself to the Tangut merchant my blood starts to boil And where is the beautiful story about the friendship between Temujin and Jamukha One could make a great movie out of it Where is the story of the rise of Temujin Of his childhood of his relationship with his family with his brothers of how he struggled to survive among mighty enemies of his family where is Van khan who helped him a lot where is the depiction of life in the steppe of the life of the nomads of their traditions of their relations with the other nations around thembr br Where is development of the characters We totally fail to see what brought Temujin together with Jamukha and what brought them apart and most important how Temujin became Chinggiskhan how he an outcast with no wealth and military power managed to unite the Mongolian tribes and create such an organized and effective war machine that crushed one nation after another and created the largest land empire in history All this could make several interesting and dramatic stories with complicated plots and deep characters but unfortunately we didnt see any of it in Bodrovs creation not even a glimpse,negative

Some spoilers If you are a big horror movie fan then you will know that Halloween paved the way for many slasher films Often imitated never duplicated this movie is a true horror classic and is definitely one of the scariest movies ever made if not THE scariestbr br I actually saw this movie after seeing the rest of the series dont ask me why I honestly saw the other 7 movies before seeing this one thats just how it worked out But I would have to say this one blows all the others away It is genuinely frightening and seeing Michael pop out from behind a bush or walk around in the dark sends a chill down your spine My favorite part of the movie was when Michael stabs a guy and leans his head to one side It is one of the eeriest images in movie historybr br Later slashers such as the Friday the 13th films were more fun and less intense than this movie I do like the F13 series better than the Halloween series but this movie alone is better than all the F13 movies Michael Myers is such a scary villain because he is realistic you could imagine a crazed guy like him going around killing people I admit this movie gave me nightmares after watching it for a few nightsbr br Whats great about this movie is that it doesnt rely on gore or humor to entertain the audience It is just pure terror Its too bad the later films of the series swayed from this one because this is as good of an example of a spectacular slasher movie as they come,positive

This beautiful story of an elder son coming home and learning to love and be a part of all those things that he left home to get away from is poignant and moving It shows a society that is perhaps strange to us in the Western world with a sense of family that we have lost The story is beautiful sad and at times funny and comic It has a feeling of realism that we dont seem to see any longer in our western moviesbr br The acting is unusual in that as the movie progresses it almost gives the impression that it is not acting but a documentary of ordinary people This is brilliant directing and movie makingbr br Would love to see more movies by this director,positive
I rarely make these comments but I felt compelled to spare others the pain I endured in watching this movie Its so stupid and implausible both in the overall story and in the details that you simply cant suspend disbelief The problem starts early when you see a government researcher tooling around in a new Porsche and dining with his team in a restaraunt that looks like a castle overlooking the Capitol Building in Washington DC That kind of life on a government salary Hah It only gets worse Toward the end when the bad guy starts killing off the good guys the latter group act so stupidly that you want them to die in order to cleanse the gene pool The special effects are pretty good  any producers money can buy that  and the lead actors have been great in other films but the screenplay and direction here are moronic Many people have wondered whether there was some deliberate intelligence behind Paul Verhoevens previous facially stupid movies Showgirls Starship Troopers but this movie should stop the wondering Hes just plain bad,negative
Cry Freedom is not just a movie It is a historical account heroic story and insight into the cultural background of a major event in history Not only does Denzel Washington do a terrific job of impersonating a motivating determined hero Steve Biko but he delivers a message to the public about the horrors of South Arfrican Apartheid The story of Biko an influential leader and his main influencee Donald Woods is a heartbreaking one But the ultimate success of his life can go beyond the atrocities committed in South Africa Cry Freedom manages to communicate to its audience the optimistic aspect of the seemingly disturbing plot It is because of great films like this one that the public can become educated on terrible events in history great leaders who sought to end them and how we can never allow them to happen in the future Because of this importance Cry Freedom is an amazing film that should be seen by all,positive

As I expected would happen too many reviews of this film from professionals and amateurs alike have focused as much if not more on the films ideology Thats because The Sea Inside aka Mar adentro is a film about euthanasia Specifically its a true story about an infamous Galician named Ramón Sampedro who fought for many years for the right to assisted suicide who was denied that right by the Spanish constitutional court and whowell I dont want to ruin the ending of the film for youbr br The real life Sampedro catalyzed a national debate on euthanasia in Spain Now with producerdirectorwritercomposereditor Alejandro Amenábars Abre Los Ojos 1997 and The Others 2001 biopic The Sea Inside another rhetorical aid has been provided in the international debate on this hot button issuebr br But as I keep saying to deaf ears your opinion pro or con on the films ideology shouldnt affect your rating of the film Youre not supposed to be rating the philosophical or political messages that Amenábar wants to make Youre supposed to be rating the film as a film Maybe thats a bit too idealistic as none of us can likely completely divorce our evaluations from our ideological biases but idealistic or not thats the goalbr br So forget about the philosophical and political issues for a moment As a film Amenábar has turned in one of his most elegant and mature works to date He does not focus on societal debates He does not focus on Sampedros legalpolitical struggles He focuses on Sampedro as a man living out his days confined to a bed in his brothers homebr br Sampedro played here in an amazing performance by Javier Bardem was a quadriplegic As the film begins he has been a quadriplegic for 26 years That condition was brought about as Amenábar shows us through marvelously shot flashbacks by a diving accidentSampedro was distracted by a beautiful woman miscalculated the water dove in snapped his neck and almost drowned As a quadriplegic he eventually began writing poetry some of which was published in a book entitled Cartas Desde El Infierno Letters from Hell in real life Sampedros book became a best seller in Spain Perhaps taking Sampedros artistic work as a cue Amenábar has created an elegantly poetic filmbr br Most of The Sea Inside is set inside Sampedros bedroom The focus in these scenes is Bardems complex and sublime performance As a quadriplegic Bardem is limited to moving his head and talking He has mastered subtle changes of expression and inflection to convey a deep character with a multifaceted intellectual approach to life Bardem and Amenábar have Sampedro often waxing philosophical in understated speech but theres always a combination of a wicked sense of humor passion for the aestheticincluding music and women and a sadness and even occasionally bitterness not far below the surface Different underlying emotions occasionally break through like waves on the skin of the oceanbr br The people Sampedro interacts with most frequently facilitate this in complex ways These others include his sisterinlaw Manuela Mabel Rivera who has been his chief caretaker since Sampedros accident his brother José Celso Bugallo who is one of the vocal objectors to Sampedros wish to die and with whom there is an underlying unresolved issue it seems like maybe José was the one to save Sampedro from drowning his nephew Javier Tamar Novas who is perhaps the most understanding towards him a righttodie advocate Gené Clara Segura a pro bono lawyer Julia Belén Rueda whom he wanted because she had a degenerative disease CADASIL Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy and would thus by more empathic and who he falls in love with and Rosa Lola Dueñas a local woman who works at a cannery and moonlights as a DJ who heard about him from the media who wants to convince him to desire to live and who falls in love with himbr br The bulk of the film consists of these characters interacting with Sampedro in his room There are also a few other ancillary characters including Sampedros father who remains oddly distant and a notorious and mediaconscious priest Padre Francisco José María Pou who does his best to change Sampedros mind via philosophytheology in a scene often mistakenly characterized as comicit has an attendant comic element but the scene is primarily very seriousbr br That most of the film takes place in Sampedros room ingeniously gives the couple significant changes in setting greater impact Sampedros room has a nice big window which he says he is satisfied with as an observation point on the world Maybe even more importantly he regularly imagines the window as a launching pad through which he flies across the hillsides to the ocean which he always loved and which has been the most influential force in his lifeit provided his living when he was younger and took his mobility away Amenábar gives us a fantastical sequence of Sampedro imagining one of his flights to the sea It is beautifully shot with low angles presumably from a helicopter of the hills rushing by until we follow a stream to the wideopen ocean which in this film represents freedom the infinite and natural forcesbr br The other significant change of setting arrives with Sampedro finally taking to a wheelchair he otherwise refused them saying they mocked his immobility to make an appearance in court to help plead his case Amenábar gives us a poignant melancholy travelogue shot subjectively of Sampedro viewing life and the world in action from the car windowbr br Whether you agree with legalizing euthanasia or not its difficult to deny that this is a wellacted wellscripted and wellconstructed film You may not believe that its a ten and thats even more unlikely if you disagree with legalizing euthanasia but its still worth watching as a fine example of artistic sophisticated filmmaking,positive
Lifeforce 1985 was a Cannon funded film directed by Tobe Hooper Its a very interesting film that deals with a pair of space vampires who are accidentally brought back down to Earth during the latest space shuttle mission Steve Railsback stars as the sole survivor of the tragedy But really folks the movie is a mere showcase for the natural beauty of Mathilda May Shes one smoking hot number The director was a huge fan of Female Vampire aka Erotikill Miss May recreates Lina Romays title role The film is beautifully photographed and directed Theres plenty of gore effects to keep genres fans happybr br I have to give this film a very high rating Tobe Hooper was the man He made three interesting films for Cannon during this time period Texas Chainsaw Massacre II and Invaders from Mars as well If you like science fictionhorror films Tobe Hooper films or Mathilda May this films just up your alleybr br Highest Recommendationbr br Did I mention Mathilda May is smoking hot,positive
I saw Peter Watkins Culloden and The War Game a few months before this and was very impressed The technique is essentially the same or at least very similar in this film detailing on the one hand a trial of dissidents in California in the apparently near future and on the other the attempts of a group of convicted criminals to slog through 50 miles of desert to win their freedom in a governmentrun punishment park as an alternative to prison Watkins films everything in a documentary style which causes for more than a little awkwardness or required strong suspension of disbelief how is it that the camera crew is with the group of starving and parched prisoners over 2 days without either offering help or sharing in their misery And thats merely the most obvious example But questionable storytelling aside this packs a punch no question you have to be interested in political filmmaking to really get involved but the film really isnt like anything else of its era it pulls no punches offers no simple solutions The leftist political figures are certainly painted broadly at times but they arent all alike the rightwing government functionaries seem a little more cartoonish but even they are allowed to show at least a little humanity Overall the film gives much to think about and leaves an indelible taste810 DVD rental,positive

I cant think of anything I repeat ANYTHING positive about this Movie The whole 1 hour 45 minute movie could be shrunken into a short 5minute movie In most scenes there is absolutely nothing going on and it seems just the camera was left on recording on purpose only to increase the time of the movie All you see is someone in the background walking around or watching TV with no specific subject or even talk what so ever I just feel Ive wasted 105 minutes of my my familys and my friends weekend for nothing If a movie is poorly made or the scenario isnt great thats whole another story at least it leaves you something to discuss about but about DISTANT I just have to call it a Movie because it was motion pictures recorded by a camerabr br If you havent seen it imagine a 105min long movie based on twothree lines of story What will you end up with 5 of content and 95 of fillers Thats exactly how Distant was at least for us Actors did a great job acting roles that had nothing special in them they barely talked or showed any special emotions I picked up this movie in the comedy section of a store relying on what I read on the back of its cover Im still wondering what was funny in it other than our face after watching the movie,negative
Greyfriars Bobby was NOT a westie  Bobby was a skye terrier A highlight of my childhood day trips to Edinburgh was to go to the monument to Bobby I grew up with the story of the valiant and loyal little dog as every child in my generation did and I remember lining up with my mum outside the cinema  with many many other Dundee children and their mums  to see the wonderful Disney film How could a movie based on such a wonderful story have been made using a Westie for heavens sake Thats like making a movie about the life of Robert Burns for instance and portraying him as an Englishman I saygive Bobby back his breed,negative
With a title like that its above and beyond my comprehension how this movie just did NOT appeal to me Granted theres a few decently sleazy moments and a little gore but the way in which the movie was shot and the overall storyline just struck me as an idiotic and lazy attempt at profuse shock tactics The inconsistent plot starts with a guy raping and murdering a woman stranded at the side of the road He and his abetting brother are imprisoned up until the brother breaks out and arranges to meet his girlfriend out in the woods He ends up forcing her into a house where they screw and he later shows her a collection of kidnapped guys in the basement The heavily drugged captives consist of her old boyfriend who raped her a grabby neighbor and her sexually abrasive boss He explains to her that he is going to kill them all She winds up killing HIM and then turning her focus towards the men or pigs whom she tortures and kills herself Most of the violence and humiliation has to do with sht eating and genitalia destroying  all of which are far from disturbing and essentially mild The best scene is a graphic broom handle masturbation followed by some painful manrape Surely I Spit on Your Corpse I Pss on Your Grave was intended as an unofficial sequel to I Spit on Your Grave  based on mainly the title and a reference the main character gives  suggesting her mother was Camille Keaton I personally consider that to be a wildly blasphemous assertion This movie is a boring amateurish mess that strives for shocks but failed miserably,negative
After watching Avalon which was decent only because of the very nice digital fx and several anime films written by Oshii including JinRoh which is fantastic I decided I should check out the Oshii cinema trilogy box set Being that the Red Spectacles and Stray Dog are related I will comment here on both And let me tell you it was one of the biggest wastes of money I have spent in a while I first watched Stray Dogs and then The Red Spectacles I am sad to say that these films are quite possibly the most boring two movies I have ever seen For only about 10 minutes in each film do you get to see some action between the the characters who are only dressed in the Panzer Cop outfits for a few fleeting scenes The rest of the time you will see some very drawn out scenes filled with boring dialogue in some less than impressive locations I really dont understand the motivation behind these two films at all I love the Wolf Brigade outfits and the idea behind the plot but the films themselves leave much to be desired I would suggest NOT watching these films and certainly do not buy the box set like I did unless you enjoy wasting money Oh and if you are wondering what I think about the 3rd movie in the set Talking Head I couldnt even bring myself to watch it before I purged the box set from my DVD collection via eBay at a 20 loss If you want cool Japanese live action check out Returner or Ichii the Killer or the Zeiram series,negative
There is some spectacular heart stoppingly beautiful photography here of a range of scenery and animals from arctic to tropical and everything in between The camera techniques are varied and spot on from close ups to aerial work Editing is tremendous and the commentary is spot on too with just the right tone and some dramatic and telling facts about our world Where the film falls down a bit is in trying to cover and integrate four themes  seasonal patterns climate change individual animal stories and hunter hunted interactions across multiple environments Eventually it all gets a bit bitty and disjointed Overall well worth seeing especially given the issues covered but dont expect Oscar material,positive
Whatever his name is the writer and director should be locked away in hopes garbage like this is never made again This one is in a battle with some of the most awful movies of all time Sometimes movies are bad in a way that theyre actually sort of good Not this one This was so bad I got angry Seriously A drunken 10 year old could have come up with a better script What a waste ALL the actors were completely uninspired to work at all the CGI was barely acceptable the sequences of scenes were completely retarded and hurt the little bit of story there was its like he just decided I want this to happen and this to happen but I dont care how we got there just shoot it and put it in Whatever Im going back to my trailer to pick my nose if anyone calls for me Im not here Shame on you whatever your name is Shame on you,negative
This was the worst TV movie I had ever seen The visuals were so dang choppy it made me dizzy I hated the constant zoom in and zoom out and the frequent Black and White to Color switch I also thought that The story didnt make any sense what so ever and it was another clichéd Action Movie with a hero a bad guy and a few hostages I could make a better movie than that with my own camera why I can hold it steady something the director couldnt do Over all truly the worst I have ever seen you thought Disney was bad I didnt even bother to watch the whole thing because Im sure I could guess the outcome and the visual were the worst I have ever seen,negative
Holes was a GREAT movie Disney made the right choice Every person who I have talked to about it said they LOVED it Everyone casted was fit for the part they had and Shia Labeouf really has a future with acting Sigourney Weaver was perfect for The Warden she was exactly how I imagined her everyone who hasnt seen it I recommend it and I guarantee you will Dig It,positive
An excellent family movie gives a lot to think on Theres absolutely nothing wrong in this film Everything is just perfect The script is great  its so real such things could happen in everyones life And dont forget about acting  its just awesome Just look at Frankie and Youll know what I thought about This picture is a real cantmiss,positive

I have to mention two failures for you to understand that this movie brilliantly succeeded where they failed A Scanner Darkly and Immortel Ad Vitam If you were excited by the concepts of these two movies and felt woefully disappointed like me you will probably enjoy Renaissance It immerses you into the world of a future Paris It is not quite dystopian They did the animation so well that I thought it was rotoscoped but from what I can tell it was not it was merely motion capture The facial expressions are amazing Not since TRON have I seen a fantasy world so well displayed in an animationlive hybrid The Black and White medium is used to slowly direct your attention to the subject of the scene my favorite effect was what they did with headlight beams watch for it The director plays with your attention and confusion but you are satisfied eventually by finding the thread that he wants you to find The overall effect is a harsh and gritty urban world filled with small surprisesbr br The plot is secondary but it isnt terrible It is noirish There is a backstory for most of the major characters giving them some depth There is weather There are sets so you can feel like you are in different places in Paris There is some action and even a car chase I am going to have to see this one again to get everything I also recommend a very large screen to view it as the sets are detailed and the credits are small,positive
Back in 1985 I caught this thing I cant even call it a movie on cable I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control I figured out early on that this was hopeless Stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes The plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after 30 minutes in Rememberthis was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY This was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the Internet and such We kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but that never happened The funniest thing about this was the original ad campaign in which the studio admitted this film was crap One poster had a fictional review that said This is the best movie Ive seen this afternoon Only Grant Cramer in the lead showed any talent and has actually gone on to a career in the business Nobudget and boring ta Skip it,negative
There is no story The plot is hopeless A filmed based on a car with a stuck accelerator no brakes and a stuck automatic transmission gear lever cannot be good I would have stopped that car within one minute whether I was in it or in the police car constantly following it I feel sorry for the actors that had to put up with such a poor script The few scenes that some similarity to action was heavily overdramatized and as far from reality you can get In addition there were a lot of blunders for instance the hood of the runaway car which was popped doing 100mph At first it just folded over the windshield like it would in reality but then afterwards it blew off The car was later in the movie observed with the hood onbr br This film was nothing but annoying stay away from it,negative
As the summary says you just made the most ignorant comment i have ever heard on an RPG You seriously thought they were gay Are you retarded If you went to go save your best friend and someone decides out of the goodness of his heart to help you then you are in a serious debt to that man Lavitz was a good person and each time they helped each other it made them closer as friends They werent gay lovers like your bitching about And to let you know the game is set in a medieval time period Back then women did just prepare meals while the men fought Do you even know your history Do you know how long it took for women to be accepted in the army in present day This game contains a lot of realism even though your too damn slow obviously to catch it and you really need to spit out some solid proof instead of ignorant assumptions based off your misguided act to interpret the story,negative

Cafe Lumiere is a beautifully photographed nullity Unacquainted with the work of the director I am wellacquainted with the filmmaker he is supposedly paying tribute to  Ozu Yasujiro While not even approaching Ozu in greatness Hou has communicated nothing of Ozus depth of emotion and concentration on meaning within a closed space One of the things he misses entirely is Ozus attention to character  we are not even introduced by Hou to his lead character a perfect blank page There are no medium or close shots of his people One of the DVD extras offers interviews with the actors and gives us precisely what Hou doesnt  a good look at their facesbr br There was a great Spanish film by Bardem called Nunca Pasa Nada which translates to something like Nothing Ever Happens That would be a far better title to this pointless exercise All through the film we are given clues about an obscure Taiwanese composer some of whose work we hear on the soundtrack But the clues like everything else add up to nothing Unless youre a trainspotter this film has nothing to recommend it,negative
BE WARNED OF POSSIBLE SPOILERSbr br A friend told me to check out this series and Im glad I took her words for itbr br I read the synopsis on the DVD cover and I was immediately intrigued The main protagonist is Muslim No way this is a first Its about an FBI agent who is under deep cover to penetrate a possible sleeper cell in LA and get this  he is a practicing Muslim I was a little skeptical at first halfexpecting some hero or the antagonist to spout maybe silly gratuitous and mindless holierthanthou fanatic drivels lets face it a lot of shows have been guilty of thisbr br But then I watched the first three episodes and I thought Okay this is good It wasnt until episode four Scholar when I was well and truly impressed I would like to commend on the great writing and also superb performances from the actors I just love how complex every one of these characters  theyre not straight out twodimensional cardboard cutout good guysbad guys Michael Ealy gives a wonderful and believable performance as the Muslim FBI agent Darwyn AlSayeed treading the fine line between being the good Muslim and being a man with flaws Oded Fehr gives his character Farik an interesting depth  Farik is not the typical oily Middle Eastern stereotype but simply someone who truly believes in his cause and doesnt see himself as a fanatic but a man willing to do whatever extreme measures to justify his beliefs Hes very charismatic and authoritative But I would say that it was Alex Nesics performance that clearly left an impression in me in Scholar His portrayal of his characters emotional struggle was amazing  torn between the softly spoken words of a Muslim scholar encouraging him to return to the nonaggressive way because it is the only acceptable way in Gods eye and Fariks persuasion to believe otherwisebr br Im looking forward to watch more shows like this and not some ridiculously highoctane one man show series Its clever and openminded,positive
They had such potential for this movie and they completely fall flat In the first Cruel Intentions we are left wondering what motivated the lead characters to become the way they are and act the way they do There is almost NO character development whatsoever in this prequel Its actually a very sad story but this film did nothing for me It was as if they left out good writing in place of unneeded fwords And the end makes absolutely no sense and doesnt explain anything The writing was just terrible Another thing that bothered me was that they used at lease 3 of the EXACT SAME lines that were in the original Such as down boy or the kissing scene and a few others I cant remember I was not impressed at all by Robins acting but Amy did a great job Thats about the only thing that reconciled this movie,negative
I wanted to like this movie but there is very little to like about it It starts out with Jean Stapleton and a Randy Newman song in Iowa Northwest Iowa I guess reminiscent of Norman Lears Cold Turkey which was one of the best movies ever made according to people on IMDb So far so good And the idea of the archangel Michael living at Pansy Milbanks motel on earth Well give it a chance its supposed to be a comedy Okay so far so good But Michael does things that an angel not fallen would never do and that completely blows any credibility the movie might have had The other characters in the movie dont have much appeal either Michael brings a dog back to life and were supposed to be in awe of that The people make up corny country songs In the end Stapleton dances with Travolta Big deal If she was smart she wouldnt even be in this movie When it was over I thought Gee what a stupid tasteless boring corny sacrilegious movie Its not fit to be seen by children or anyone else,negative
Obviously a lot of talented behind the scenes crew members worked on this movie so dont even look at the credits at the end youll only hold it against them Nobody seemed interested in seeing this movie only 3 were in the theater two passed out after 10 minutes and they were the lucky ones The monsters were the unemployed worm from Star Trek 2 The Wrath of Khan and rejected designs for the space creatures in Alien The creators of the movie obviously didnt want to overshadow the third rate movie monsters so they hired forth rate actors who apparently didnt get to memorize their lines or in some cases learn to pronounce the words before filming began Some scenes are incredibly inept in conveying just what is supposed to be happening if anything is If you are unfortunate enough to be in a theater where this movie is showing and you dont pass out youll laugh at what are supposed to be frightening or suspenseful moments of the film The implausibility of several scenes will just stun you and Stephen Dorffs regular spewing of the Queen Mary of curse words conveys the feeling of anyone who pays to see this If you must see this movie do yourself a favor and wait until its in the bargain bin at the video store If theres any justice in the film industry one of the main actors will be there to rent it to you,negative
A truly muddled incomprehensible mess Most things in the film look more or less like 1987 but then there are futuristic things just thrown in like the policemans ray gun And that car The director seemed to be in love with colored lights The only really notable performance was the girl who played Valerie but since there was no cast listing I dont know which actress that was This one is worth missing Grade F,negative
This is classic 80s humor If you were a teen in the 80s this was a summer hit to go see It was a early look at those now super stars This and Better off Dead just are fun and silly movies to sit back and enjoy Everyone can admit they had a crazy summer when they were a teenager Even crazy family and friends like these characters To be introduced to some of these characters was so much fun The uncle who is crazy sitting every waking moment at a radio waiting to win a million dollars the grandmother who only likes the granddaughter and handed a bill to the kids after dinner the twin brothers who look nothing alike and to meet hoopz was so much fun This may not of won an award but it is just a fun movie to get lost in one afternoon,positive
This is a Very Very VERY bad movie br br The plot is weak the acting is bad and the science is worsebr br The special effects are unconvincing The dramatic scenes are a joke Every step of the way you can see coming a mile away The end is disappointing and there is no suspense The best aspect of the film is the soundtrackbr br The only reason not to give this a lower vote is because it is a TV movie and i believe the budget was low to start of withbr br I do believe that the young female fans of Luke Parry will still see this movie however he has done better work Again this is Terrible Very very very terrible If you have a choice look at something else,negative
Black Day Blue Night was actually good modern noir Three young nomads on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere as most modern noir does One woman finds that her husband is cheating on her and after finding him in a hotel room decides to head off and start anew Strangely enough she travels with her husbands mistress who is forgiveable given that the sleazebag never told her he was married And together while driving in the pouring rain they meet a third very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets While theyre giddy and free and all suspicious of one another the cops back at town have them marked as suspects in the death of a policemanbr br Black Day Blue Night starts out with immediate confrontation and throws in a pretty good story with all its twists meant to mislead your suspicions of one character after another leading to a very unusual ending That is the movie starts with immediate action confrontation and once you think the story is solved you are immediately thrust into yet another turn in the plot revealing just a little more than you expected before the movie is over br br But as some viewers have written the ending is slightly confusing and a bit of a let down The killer is not who you would immediately expect and once revealed becomes somewhat confusing due to a rather thinly explained flashback which reveals all of the necessary motive to solve the mystery But actually there is a finale beyond that which I would think is the most interesting of the film Because modern noir always involves a circle of criminal suspects almost always all of them guilty of something it is also a genre that always involves money And thus the question in these movies always becomes how far are the characters willing to go for moneybr br If you like this rendition of modern film noir I would suggest watching Red Rock West its also got JT Walsh and some goingons in the blasted desert,positive
This last Dutch speaking film of Verhooven made me laugh good As a film buff looking for all the small details and cross references etc in any movie I can assure anyone interested in film art that this piece amuses all the senses I havent read Gerard Reves book on which the film is based but I still believe we get a candid picture of a somewhat selfconceited poetwriter who gets his in a way  no spoiling here An antihero surrounded by characters that have their ambiguous intentions as has he All this in a superbly packaged cinematography Paul Verhopven manages to turn the otherwise rather cute gesellich Dutch locations into a suspenseful filmnoir setting impressive work,positive

This show has a few clichés and a few over the top Dawsons Creeklike moments a 16yearold talking about way back when life made sense but overall it seems like a decent show Most of the characters seem very real and the story seemed to move along well in the pilot  ending with a good lesson in the end I just hope every episode doesnt turn out to be lifealtering like the first that would just be too much drama for this vehicle Jeremy Sumpter does an excellent job as a teenager with a passion for baseball I believe a lot of us could relate to his awe and sometimes tunnel vision for the team that he always wanted to a part of,positive

237 succeeds admirably at showing us what Australian teenagers feel and dont say These are the stories of real kids and I think we would be naive to think otherwise The only new thing 237 really brings us is an Australian point of view We often watch troubled American children but often fail to link the same problems to our own teens Executed with clever and artful cinematography I did however upon immediate recognition of the disappointing final song find the musical direction lacking in sophistication I applaud the fabulous casting of this film These are regular looking Aussie kids who invite plenty of sympathy because of this Great performances all round and you cant top Gary Sweet this film made me remember why sometimes high school sucked and unless youre squeamish or you like to leave with warm and fuzzies go and see 237,positive
I only watched the first twenty minutes of this movie and personally I think that this is the worst movie to be made in the recent yearsbr br The plot was so bad that it might have been possible that a 10 year old kid wrote it The acting was also sloppy with pretty much an unknown cast and not only that the action sequences especially at the first half of the film were so terrible it was unbelievablebr br I dont know how the producers obtained the budget to film this movie but the production company must be regretting it by nowbr br To anyone who may come across this film in the near future I advise you to steer clear of this joke of a movie,negative

Where the Sidewalk Ends 1950 opens appropriately with Dana Andrews and Gene Tierneys names inscribed on the sidewalk as dirty water streams down between the bars of a sewer grate The sidewalk represents respectability integrity and morality  only crooks and delinquents walk in the gutter But even the most honourable of men have a tendency to misstep on occasion and when the sidewalk abruptly comes to an end sometimes it proves impossible to avoid getting ones shoes wet Mark Dixon Dana Andrews was born in the gutter his father a professional criminal and has spent his entire life clawing his way back onto the sidewalk perpetually balanced on the edge of the kerb As a police detective Dixon wants nothing more than to display the decency and integrity that his father lacked but he possesses a meanstreak that he cant escape When his quick temper leaves a murder suspect dead Dixon finds himself becoming the very father whom he despised a cheap criminal wholl cheat and lie to cover up his offencebr br Where the Sidewalk Ends was the only film to reunite Dana Andrews Gene Tierney and director Otto Preminger after the superb Laura 1944 though the two films as far as noir goes couldnt be further apart Whereas the earlier picture had the strong intimacy of a countryhouse murder tale this film is more conventional as a gritty urban police drama Given her ravishingly memorable performance as Laura Hunt its unfortunate that here Tierney is grossly underused occupying the typical niche of the pretty helpless romantic interest much as she did that same year in Jules Dassins The Night and the City 1950 Andrews on the other hand has rarely been better exhibiting a toughness and unhinged anger that I hadnt expected of him Gary Merrill is suitably smug as the crime boss Scalise but he doesnt seem mean enough for the role and I think that an actor like Richard Conte who played Mr Brown in The Big Combo 1955 would have better suited the character I hadnt realised this but Conte appeared just one year earlier in Premingers Whirlpool 1949br br The tension as Dixon attempts to cover up his accidental crime is absolutely riveting  certainly among the most suspenseful sequences of its era  though I feel that the situation still wasnt exploited to its full potential The taxi driver is the only person who could have decisively identified Dixon as the perpetrator but Preminger hurriedly skims over the moment when he passes Dixon on the stairs Had the witness been brought in as Dixon was reenacting his own movements outside the apartment entrance we could have had some genuine fireworks And why for that matter couldnt the taxi drivers testimony have immediately absolved Jiggs Taylor Tom Tully from suspicion of murder Niggling inconsistencies such as these tarnish an otherwise excellent screenplay from Ben Hecht who infuses his gritty criminal underworld with hardhitting cops and wisecracking felons Andrews seething and implosive lawenforcer tormented by rage and remorse has rarely been done better at least the equal of Robert Ryan in Nicholas Rays On Dangerous Ground 1952,positive
If the caper genre owes a lot to Walter Huston it also has a debt of gratitude to Jules Dassin a man that was ahead of his times and who suffered a lot because of his blacklisting when Edward Dmytryk accused him of being a Communist The end of his American career would have meant the end of Mr Dassin but moving to Europe proved he was bigger than the same people that had contributed to his Hollywood demisebr br Rififi is an elegant film in which all the right elements come together thanks to Mr Dassins vision He decided to adapt Auguste Le Bretons novel because he saw the possibilities for turning it into a caper film that became an instant classic Jules Dassin was penniless in Paris when he discovered the city that were going to serve as the background to his film The bad weather paid off for Mr Dassin as the streets were always wet and not much had to be done to show them that waybr br When we first meet Tony he is playing cards Tony appears to be in bad health he coughs all the time and sweats profusely After losing all his money he goes to see Jo the Swede who tells him about a possibility for a robbery at Maupin  Webb the fancy jewelry store at a tony section of Paris They pass the idea through Mario who suggests Cesar the Milanese an expert safe crackerbr br Tony who has come out of prison recently learns that Mado his former lover is now with Grutter a creep that owns a night club Upon confronting Mado instead of love all he feels is contempt and the meeting ends badly and he throws her out of his place Grutter has no love for Tony who is his natural enemy because of his connection with Madobr br When the day arrives the gang is able to get to the apartment building where on the second floor right above the jewelry store the owner lives but he is away Everything goes well and the gang gets away with the jewels Cesar the Milanese a typical ladies man takes a ring as a souvenir which in turn he gives the chanteuse at the Grutters night club This tactical mistake is the spark which unravels the well thought planbr br Jean Servais made an excellent Tony He showed a tired man who was possibly doing his last robbery Carl Mohner Robert Manuel and the director Jules Dassin are seen as Jo Mario and Cesar the quartet jewelry thieves Marie Sabouret plays Mado Marcel Lupovici plays Grutter with a subdued intensity Robert Hussein who would go to direct movies later on makes an impression with his Remi one of Grutters menbr br The film best asset is the great camera work by Philippe Agostini who captured the atmosphere of Paris and the locales where all these criminals operate from Georges Aurics music plays well with the action in the film Jules Dassin was peculiar in his choice of films that he directed and unfortunately that is our loss because this man was a genius as proved mainly with The Naked City Night and the City and Rififi,positive
This is the best film version of Dickens classic tale Ive seen it over and over on VHS and recently acquired the DVD version which is formatted for TV not widescreen What I find interesting about this teleplay is the cast of English actors who are now recognizable since many have appeared in other filmsshows in North America since 1984 My biggest surprise is Edward Woodward the Equalizer as the Ghost of Christmas Present,positive
Over the GW is a near failure of a debut feature and not because its not without tryingActually it is Its a shamble all the more because its writerdirectortechnical everyman Nick Gaglia went through the same rehab cult that he depicts in the film Sometimes a first time filmmaker full of the vigor that comes with getting a thumbs up or two from fellow film students goes headlong into style that is way too disjointed unsure and dramatically frustrating that the personal side of the story the extremely personal side gets smudged in the purpose of telling a good story Gaglia who was 13 when put into a horrid program that basically tortured and brainwashed their patients with crazy group scare tactics psychological mindf sessions that could go on for days and attitudes from the rehab leaders that would make most Nazis cringe escaped finally when he was 15 Im glad he got out though it might help if he now goes into a real rehab for his filmmaking skills if only for a couple of days to learn things like say structure proper lighting fluid camera movement subtlety with actors and other basics that are perpetually lost herebr br Its all the more frustrating because Gaglia is dealing with a subject that should be shown more to the public there was recently a Newsweek article referring to a similar AA cultrehab Many times one wonders if certain personal character studies might work better as documentaries as opposed to narrative dramas This is an evernagging sensation throughout Over the GW where it almost feels like Gaglia wants to tell the truth but doesnt know how to communicate it properly through his characters The character that one would think is closest to him Bronx teen Tony Serra Gallagher who is taken by his mother to a rehab in New Jersey would be closest to Gaglia is actually much more of a onedimensional being where there is very little backstory we see a brief freakout in black and white in his old home and little connection to his mother Moriarty who has more potential that is never tapped aside from a cold stone who passes her kids off to another But there is a story to go with his twoyear crisis I guessbr br Right off the bat things get rough a nude cavity search in the first five minutes and soon its clear that instead of medical care its more like a cross between anger management and some bizarre religious sect where the head doctor Hiller Insinnia is a total overcontrolling loon But soon Tonys sister Sofia Donohue gets thrown in to the program and as opposed to Tonys repeated moments of outrage and supposed noncompliance she goes headon through the whackedout three step program and once released becoming a runaway At times there are bits in this fractured nightmare where theres one woman a 22 year old mother who has been in the program a year and a half finds shes become a prisoner not allowed to leave and when the father of the main siblings comes and pays an enraged visit to Hiller when Sofia finally returns to them that do contain some raw power very brief glimpses of Gaglia being able to at least garner some leverage in pure melodramabr br But these are moments few and far between Its not just the unsuccessful characters who are mostly reduced to stereotypes that veer into being like hysterical DARE ripoffs maybe some of them like an angry black youth the passiveaggressive counselors or even Serras older sister who is ratted out by the siblings as having taken a hit off a joint and almost thrown into the program would resonate more if there was more time given to develop any of them Its that Gaglia is so unfocused in his multiple roles on his tiny 30000 budget that not one side of whatever potential talent he has can come through He overuses tints mostly with a shade that looks urinecoated he jiggles his handheld DVX camera as if its supposed to be intense ala City of God occasionally a character will just shoot into frame randomly his choices of music are like the worst selections possible from pseudoindie softrockers and theres even inane fake interview scenes with Nicholas Serra inspiration  and Krakowsky that feel about as false as possiblebr br Could Gaglia just not get any interviews with the real victims he was with and resort to wouldbe artistically cathartic plan B Bottom line no matter how much fromtheheart true life stories may appeal to you dont bother seeing it in the theater or even on rental unless you love a final scene with two kids staring off into the digitalhued Hudson river sunset with the final words reading Dedicated to the Kids Oy,negative
Some moron who read or saw some reference to angels coming to Earth decided to disregard what hed heard about the offspring of humans and angels being larger than normal humans Reinventing them as mythical giants that were 40 feet tall is beyond ridiculous There was some historical references to housing and furniture in parts of the world that were much larger than would be needed for standard humans These were supposedly built on a scale that would lend itself to a 10 to 14 foot human somewhat supporting the David and Goliath tale from the bible There is no mention in any historical references to buildings or artifacts that would support the idea of a 40 foot tall being If I was rating this movie on my own scale it would have been a negative value instead of a one,negative
I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger and gradually getting less so until getting jaded enough as Im sure many other viewers have become so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm The Dentist turned that aroundbr br The setup seems simple a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths and perhaps bodies as well A clever twist though is that the dentist is the films protagonist so instead of being some onedimensional bad guy with no clear motivation his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable The viewer thus feels sympathy for him as well as his victims and instead of hoping for justice to come to him I found myself hoping he would somehow find a way to cover up his tracks and return to a normal lifebr br What really makes a horror movie is the violence And The Dentist does it better than any other film I can think of First off the film has tons of tension which is something that modern gore films tend to lack In one scene  the dentist is emotionally distraught and has to see a young child patient for the first time As he reaches into the childs mouth you hope that for the dentists and the childs sake the encounter ends without injury I wont spoil what happens Second when the gore does come it hits all the worst squirmy nerves Once again I wont give anything awaybr br Of course being a movie that youve never heard of it does have flaws Most importantly its exclusively for horror fans Also as another reviewer mentioned by taking place over a span of just a few days we dont really get any background on the characters And the tension drops a little bit during the very end But really the fact that we would even want to know background about the characters is evidence to how good it is and the bulk of the film is solid enough that any small lapses in tension can be forgivenbr br Its strange after years of being accustomed to movie gore to suddenly want to cover my eyes at the sight of blood The Dentist made me scared and thoroughly uncomfortable and for this it earns my full approval,positive

Watched this as a late TV movie last night purely by chance The blurb for the film said something to the effect of mother stays with daughter and goes on romantic journey as I tuned in theres the carpenter hard at work on a new conservatory  played by Daniel Craig no less  so the plot was immediately apparentbr br It turns out that eponymous mothers carpenter love interest is also the daughters boyfriend so theres trouble brewing and not too many surprises But Id been caught by Anne Reids compelling performance and I was hooked The direction allows her plenty of space for staring into mirrors and adjusting scarves when she exudes sadnessbr br The sex scenes were fascinating and taboobreaking Shouldnt older womens bodies remain covered up Not here and were treated to a delicious reawakening in the Mothers sexuality Even more startling are the drawings shes made that SPOILER once discovered confirm her daughters suspicion that somethings going on herebr br Cathryn Bradshaw as the daughter didnt convince me quite as much as the rest of the cast but that could be me With her waves of preRaph locks I kept expecting to see Julia Sawahla whose more intense face would have suited the confrontations better to my mind Bradshaw has a rounder happier face that didnt carry the anger that emerges as the film progressesbr br The ending is weak If the goodbyes for Mother as she leaves in disgrace are so indifferent then perhaps we could see some closeups of those waving goodbye and see something of their individual reasons Whatever shes done shes a recently bereaved widow leaving for the lonely home she shared with her husband for 30 years and I found the lack of sympathy jarring For a film so full of emotion and be warned its like opening champagne youll never get the lid back on the ending is a cold contradiction,positive

Followup to 1965s My Name Is Barbra and shot in brilliant color Color Me Barbra has La Streisand alternating nostalgia clowning comedy feminine romantic angst and beguiling seriousness for a crazyquilt hour of showbiz razzle dazzle Shes a cutup and a femme fatale a sprite and an enigma With her Egyptian eye makeup and everchanging hairstyles shes also a chameleon Her voice is rich and moving even if a few of her songs are not One Kiss Yesterdays The circus sequence isnt as intriguing as the museum trip with the conceit of Barbra becoming the images in the paintings an idea which works better than you may think The circusmedley built around songs featuring the word face is girlishly cute without ever really becoming enchanting Still this is a lively jazzy specialnot quite as emotionally tantalizing as My Name Is Barbra but certainly a sterling sophomore effort,positive
Norman Wisdoms final starring vehicle was a departure from his previous outings  bringing his accidentprone milquetoast uptodate this being a product of the Swinging Sixties The end result is an uneasy and occasionally embarrassing comedy which mixes the stars typical slapstick and sentimentality with mild sexuality and even milder satire the plot has to do with an executive on a trip for a banking conference falling for teenager Sally Geeson who doesnt mind getting involved with him but doesnt take their relationship all that seriously either Sarah Atkinson appears as Geesons friend who warns Norman of her fickle characterbr br The film is nowhere near as bad as Leonard Maltins BOMB rating would have it and if anything is interesting for its treatment of midlife crisis being in many ways similar to Hoffman 1970 and 10 1979  both of which incidentally Ive only just watched towards the end Norman even tries to bring his wife round to his new way of thinking The Pretty Things appear as themselves performing a number of good tunes in a nightclub and Norm himself sings the catchy title track,negative

This is a bad film as its central message is very muddled and the plot seems like it was the result of merging several disparate scripts As a result it often makes absolutely no sense at all and certainly is not a film Miss Dunne or Mr Huston should have been proud of making However the film IS worth watching if you are a fan of PreCode films because it features an amazingly sleazy plot that strongly says that nice girls DO put outeven if they arent married and even if their partner IS br br The film begins with Miss Dunne as a social worker assisting troops heading to Europe for WWI In the process she meets a scalawag Bruce Cabot who eventually convinces her to sleep with him She becomes pregnant and he then goes on to the next unsuspecting woman However Miss Dunne does NOT want him back as she realizes hes not worth it but later her baby dies at child birth While all these very controversial plot elements are used they are always alluded toalmost like they wanted the adults in the audience to know but hoped that if they phrase it or film it in just the right way kids in the audience will be clueless after all films were not rated and kids might attend any film at this timebr br Surprisingly this entire plot involving a stillborn baby and Cabot ends about 14 of the way through the film and is never mentioned again or alluded to It was as if they filmed part of a movie and abandoned ittacking it on to still another film In this second phase of the film Miss Dunne unexpectedly begins working at a womens prison though we actually never really get to see her doing anything there What we do see are countless horrible scenes of severe abuse and torture that were probably designed to titillate And as a result of all this violence Miss Dunne goes on a crusade to clean up the prison and becomes a reformer and famous writerbr br But then out of the blue another type of film emerges and the womens prison reform business goes by the wayside Dunne meets a judge Walter Huston who is married but he desperately wants her Now throughout the film Dunne is portrayed as a very good girleven though she did have unmarried sex with Cabot she was more or less tricked into it But now single Irene who is a tireless reformer and good lady begins sleeping with a married man He tells her that he and his wife are estranged and are married in name only but she never thinks to investigate if this is true and with his assurance off flies her clothes and they are in the baby making business BUT while shes pregnant with his love child hes indicted for being a crooked judge He assures her hes innocent but hes convicted and it sure sounds like hes a scoundrelusing inside information from people that have come before his bench in order to amass a fortune Then in the final moments of the film Miss Dunne tries in vain to get him freed and vows to wait with the child until Huston is released The film then endsbr br So we basically have three separate films AND a bizarre early 30s idea of what a nice girl should be like I gathered that she should be a strongminded working girl who instantly becomes an idiot in her personal relationships This really undoes all the positives about Dunnes character and its really hard to imagine anyone liking the film A strong womens rights advocate might easily be offended at how weakminded and needy she was and religious people might see her as totally amoral or at least morally suspect With a decent rewrite this could have been a good film or at least interesting as a lewd and salacious film but it couldnt make up its mind WHAT it wanted to be and was just another dull PreCode film,negative
Isnt it depressing how the most violent cartoon on Cartoon Network is aimed at girls While Im not watching soldiers getting shot and blown up on Saving Private Ryan or Band of Brothers it would be nice if there was a cartoon or at least something on TV I could watch to satisfy my violent urges And something that I would not get made fun of for watching I did see some episodes I should really be shot for this and had to sit through the movie now where do I find a gun and it is quite clear that this lost its spark after the first few episodes If you like seeing 500foot monsters that can destroy huge cities in seconds getting slaughtered by toddlers about one foot tall this is a mustsee But it does get very boring after a while and with a show like this even original ideas become chiefly dull The movie just felt like one overlong episode I cant remember any of it and the villain should have been far more intimidating than a green monkey This show is a laughing stock It churns out the same basic premise episode after episode after episode and though it may try to have some mystery and intrigue once in a while the ending will always be the same  The Powerpuff Girls save the day All is good and nice but all is very very repetitive I give it 3 out of 10 for being the only danged cartoon on CN to revolve around violence although it is aimed at girls so I wont be tuning in for it ever Ive established myself as a fan of war and violence films and I wont have that reputation destroyed 310,negative
I doubt this will ever even be a cult film I loved Gram Parsons to be sure and I did not expect much out of this film and got even less What could have been clever and moving was campy It was devoid of the music that made Gram and had more filler than cheap dog food There was no background on Gram or the colorful people of that era The characters shown were not familiar to me even as a fan of Grams and all the versions of his afterlife adventures I have heard Rock and roll is full of tales good ones too but they should taken with a grain of salt They can be great stories even though exaggerated However this movie took a good story and turned into tripe Stealing any dead body and the ensuing implications should never be a dull tale but they made it dull somehow I am tempted to steal every copy of Grand Theft Parsons head out to the desert and burn them all,negative
I had no background knowledge of this movie before I bought it but it sounded cool and Ive been wanting to see a really kickbutt Viking movie for awhile now alas this film was not what I was looking for I had hoped for the best but instead was delivered a boring Nordic soapopera that seemed to drag on too long despite its 84 minute running time The films premise is intriguing enough Its about a Viking warlord who defies his God and Odin is so enraged that he curses the warlords son named Barek to death and rebirth as a Berserker This Barek guy is then forced to live enraged insane and violent lifetime after lifetime The movie is filmed competently enough with some rich cinematography and quasigood performances by the actors but again I found myself bored and questioning when this dribble would end The filmmakers had a chance to make something rather entertaining and semiunique but they dropped the ball Perhaps it couldve been improved with some cheap exploitation tactics thrown in such as gratuitous nudity and lots of gore I mean we are talking about Berserkers here arent we Vikings were supposed to be BAD enough what with all the raping and pillaging so arent Berserkers supposed to be even more extreme All in all unless youre a fan of The Young and Restless etc or are yourself in fact an insane Berserker who likes self torture Id probably steer clear of this drab piece of celluloid,negative

Saying this movie is extremely hard to follow and just as frustrating to sit through is putting it very mildly Also saying that the current available print is dark dreary scratchy abysmally edited painfully dubbed seemingly censored and in almost unwatchable shape is also correct This film is in dire need of a good remastering from the full uncut original negative and seeing how its reasonably atmospheric and won the director an award at the Catalonia Film Festival it might actually be worth the trouble Then again maybe not Its just impossible to tell in its current condition what kind of movie it actually is It starts fairly interesting if you can discount the completely senseless precredits opening sequence which involves a deranged catkilling snakeloving little girl named Gerda The girls mom Carla Mónica Randall who should have laid off the eyeliner a little bit splashes some gasoline around in the garage and torches the brat Seemingly about as crazy as young Gerda she goes to visit her estranged photographer ex boyfriend Mario JohnCihangir Caffari Hes on vacation from work but so desperate to get away from Carla that he begs his employers to set him up on an assignment any assignment She scowls Youll be sorry as he heads out the door Well Mario is assigned to photograph Witches Mountain somewhere in the Pyrenees I believe Before he gets to his destination he gets sight of a hottie on the beach named Delia Patty Shepard and snaps a few pictures of her taking off her bikini top Only slightly peeved she claims to be a single writer the two flirt and then decide it would be a swell idea if they went on the trip up the mountain together When they stop by her place so she can pack her bags Mario suddenly hears loud sinister music Delia claims hes just hearing thingsbr br So the two begin their trip up the mountain taking a stop at a local inn to spend the night There they encounter a weird partiallydeaf crazyeyed innkeeper Victor Israel and Delia claims someone was spying on here through her window The next day under some trance she wanders off up the mountain and is eventually located by Mario who hops out of his jeep and runs after her While hes finding out whats up someone steals their wheels and theyre forced to walk a piece eventually finding the jeep undamaged at the foot of a small ancient seeming abandoned village almost like someone was trying to intentionally lure them there Well as we will see thats exactly what has happened In the village they encounter a friendly old woman named Zanta Ana Farra who claims shes the only person still living there and lets them stay in her home Mario takes some pictures of the abandoned city and when he develops them they are eerily full of people Slightly creeped out he and Delia begin to leave and get stuck in treacherous fog and have to pull over and camp out for the night The rest of the movie has to do with voodoo dolls black cats transforming into sexy women Satanic rituals performed by ladies in their bras and a deadly fall off a cliff And yeah coincidentally Carla the estranged wife turns out to be one of the witches too It all takes place in semidarkness and to be quite honest I didnt know what the hell was going on most of the time The inconclusive open ending is just an additional slap in the face to anyone having to suffer through the rest of this senseless messbr br Honestly there are just a few things that stand out to me as being really good The first is actress Shepard who has that great Barbara Steele kind of dark mysterious beauty Theres also an excellent music score credited to Fernando Garcia Morcillo and chanting songs which aided immensely in making this film as atmospheric as it is The location work is fairly decent but as I said the print is ugly as can be and it doesnt make a lick of sense so proceed with caution on this one,negative

I always feel strange and guilty saying it because Im a fairly welleducated nonteenager but I actually sort of like the Olsen twins and I respect the movies they make even though Ive never really been their target audience When in Rome was a traditional MaryKate and Ashley movie complete with the foreign travel accents motorbikes adult romance as a B storyline fashion orientation and even the gag reel over the credits I enjoyed myself When in Rome and the other Olsen twin movies never pretend to be anything theyre not most of the time they only premiere on video and they never claim to be the next Citizen Kane or even An Affair to Remember My point is people who watch this movie and expect it to be anything other than another Olsen twin movie will be disappointedbr br That said those who ARE fans of the Olsen twins will really enjoy themselves For those of us whove watched them since the first episodes of Full House its really great to see them growing into more mature roles This movie provides important historical and geographical information just like many of their other movies remember 10 Downing Street from Winning London and the visit to the Louvre from Passport to Paris as well as providing good clean fun that can be enjoyed by the whole familybr br As long as I still feel like Im on my soapbox and as long as I can make it relevant to the movie let me take a moment to challenge those who reject the Olsen twins in order to be a fan of the Olsen twins you dont have to be some preteen valley girl from California In fact thats not really the target audience If it were the MKA fashion line of clothes and accessories would be run through Gap or some store like that not WalMart When in Rome while it does feature high fashion and globetrotting and two girls from a valley in Cali isnt really ABOUT that its more about inspiring young girls who have initiative to let it take them places If that means setting the movie in some glamorous foreign city with cute guys on motorbikes so be it Thats called marketingyou take an idea and sell it by making it appealing At least theyre sending a good message even if the means seem a little superficial br br Basically dont knock the film until youve seen it and then dont knock it until youve tried to understand what the Olsen twins do they encourage young girls to be creative intuitive and driven young women This movie does that I think just like their others Kids  enjoy Parents  do the same If you like the Olsen twins you wont be disappointed,positive

Better than it has any right to be this movie died a quick and painful death at the American box office At times sophomoric at others bitingly satirical and witty Jekyll and Hyde is mostly just a near perfect reflection of the times laden with drug and sexual humor reminding one at one time or another of everything from the Woody Allen of Everything You Always Wanted To know About Sex to the Mel Brooks of The Producers Saturday Night Live to Monty Python Carlin to Cheech and Chong Watch it listen carefully because some of the jokes go by really quickly and remember a time when comedy was allowed to be offensively hilarious,positive
In Texas seven friends meet in a bar to celebrate the Halloween night before going to a party Meanwhile they call the American Nightmare pirate radio for fun and confess their innermost fears A serial killer who is listening to their confessions makes their nightmares come true killing each one of them in a sadistic way American Nightmare is a weird low budget movie that has a horrible beginning without any previous explanation a woman kills two couples in an isolated camping area as if it were Friday 13th Then the story shifts to a bar where seven friends are celebrating Halloween From this moment on the story has a great potential and the unknown cast has a very reasonable performance showing also some beautiful breasts and naked bodies as usual in this type of C production However the end of the screenplay does not provide any explanation for the killing instinct and motives for the behavior of the nurse Jane Toppan giving the sensation that the budget ended before the finalization of the shooting With a better beginning and conclusion this weird story would be a good low budget slasher movie My vote is fourbr br Title Brazil Agonia Agony,negative
1111 aka Hells Gate 2004 is another bad horror movie that tries too hard to be something its not A young girl has an imaginary play mate One day whilst out in the fields playing with her friends a couple of fugitives visit her parents and whack them off for no apparent reason The young girl runs off and hides from the bad men Years later the girl grows up into a woman with problems Losers at her school looking like repressed homosexuals flaunt their manhood in front of her when she rejected one of them The girls hate her and life in general is miserable for her A secret from her past returns to visit her Who or what is it Why does everyone hate her Whats her Guardians problem with her To find out youll have to watch Hells Gatebr br The new title makes absolutely no sense whatsoever I dont know why people are given money to make such bad movies This film is not even good enough to make fun of Its a head ache inducing mess thatl confuse anyone who tries to make some sense out of it Not worth your timebr br Not recommended,negative
I have Things to Come on DVD and its very clear compared to my VHS version The audio is fair but can be hard to understand at times br br I liked the movie so much that I searched for a copy of the book and found itIt gave details of why some things happened The best things about the movie are the small things that I didnt notice at first Such as John Cabal playing with a toy airplane at a Christmass party like it was a dive bomber out dateing sea power by naming a battleshipDinosuar Ships sunk by airpower an undeclared enemy sneak attack by airplanes Swept flying wing planes Strong rolls for the women through the entire movie br br There are more see the movie to enjoy them,positive
I swear I didnt mean to I picked this out only since it looked good on the back This movie wasnt scary at all and actually was very confusing The demon wind was only actually used a couple of times and people were killed off pretty cheesily The one major bright spot was seeing Sherri Bendorf from Slaughterhouse play in it Seeing what happened to her however made up my mind for this little turkey of a film A 3 out of 10 NEXT,negative
CRAP I accidentally watched this filmthinking that it was the Swimming Upstream that was released in 2003 I seriously regret wasting an hour of my life sitting through it Shame on whoever gave this junk an award I thoroughly loathed this filmin fact I didnt see it through to the end After an hour I could no longer stand it I am disgusted that people are amused by such a lousy scriptwhich tries and fails to rip off a dozen other human interest stories and such BAAD acting PAINFUL I rate it 1 star out of 10 An amateur could make a much much greater movie,negative
WARNING THERE MIGHT BE SPOILERS AHEAD IF YOU CAREbr br Okay the basic premise of this homegrown Texas film is College kids  spookhouse  evil magic book  scary stuff In practice it equals a lot of time looking at the time to see how much longer this movie is going to drag on A bunch of frat boys along with assorted girlfriends  volunteers is setting up a charity haunted house The project is being presided over by a thoroughly repellent character whose main purpose seems to be verbally  physically assaulting as many cast members as possible I had a hard time believing that anyone would even attempt to work with this person in any capacity hes nothing but rude and abusive to everyone including his girlfriend and his buddy Regardless the kids are visited by local character  annual pumpkincarving champion Pumpkin Jack an elderly coot who is described as the Santa Claus of Halloween and who drops off a load of props for the house including an ominous book that figured prominently in the irritatingly strobeflashed prologuewhere a gaggle of robed cultists get turned into stirfry Needless to say some damn fool starts messing with the book and eventually most of the costumed monsters turn into real ones and the remaining few normal folk have to try and survive Theres some good stuff in this film but not much everything is shot well and the makeup effects are decent On the other hand the performers either underact or overact drastically much of the plot makes little sense outside of a this happens so that can happen series there is hardly any musical score to speak of just snatches of songs throughout the film and the movie takes an hour to actually get anywhere That last problem is the most telling twothirds of the 90 minute running time is used to repeatedly set up the characters Tom is a nice guy dating Heidi the control freak but he used to date Jill who is now dating Dan the jerk but shes started a relationship Kira the girl who wears too many shawlscapes Dan is a really big jerk Gary likes to play jokes and Steve  Lily like to have a lot of sex Stuff that could have easily been dealt with in 20 minutes or so drags on and on to the point where the lesbian sex scenecalm down its pretty tame left me looking for the fast forward button That leaves us with half an hour of localorie scares a klunky ending and a deepseated dislike of ol Pumpkin Jack who I blame for the whole mess Unless you can get this on some sort of deepdiscount rentaland really have seen everything else in the store put it back on the shelf and keep looking,negative
When I was a kid I totally loved both Bill  Ted Movies The other night Bogus Journey was on and since it was at least 5 years since I last saw it I decided to tune in AND I LOVED IT ALL OVER AGAIN This film is still funny after all those years Excellent Adventure is better but this one rocks just the same Sure some of the perfomances are a bit cheesy but hey this entire film is cheesy in a cool way Plus it features the coolest personation of Death ever in a movie Concluding Totally like non bogus movie dude Way Excellent STATION,positive
I enjoy watching Robert Forster That was the main reason that I rented this movie I also wanted to see a story take place out in the middle of nowhere where the characters could work off of each other really well with no distractions br br Unfortunitaly I found the movie to be dull I couldnt get interested in the characters I couldnt get interested in the story which seemed to meander nowhere br br After watching this movie for an hour I turned it off I will rate the movie 4 out of 10 This falls well below the mandatory 7 rating that makes a movie worthwhile to watch,negative
Kairo or Pulse as its known amongst English speaking audiences is set in Tokyo  starts as Sunny Plant Sales employee Michi Kudo Kumiko Aso decides to visit her friend Taguchi Kenji Mizuhashi to enquire about a computer disk hes been working on when she gets to his place he gives her the disk but then rather inconsiderately commits suicide in front of her Meanwhile a student named Ryosuke Kawashima Haruhiko Kato has recently hooked up to the internet  keeps getting spooky messages  images on his monitor so he asks computer whizz Harue Karasawa Koyuki whats happening she doesnt really know but it seems that the place where peoples spirits go when they die is full  they need somewhere else to go  Earth is as good a place as any right These spirits dont like sharing either so they sort of make people commit suicide or turn them into ashes or something like that I dont really know because the films a bit of a messbr br This Japanese production was written  directed by Kiyoshi Kurosawa  right off the bat I have to say I hated Kairo I hated everything about it  it proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that Asian cinema can produce something as crap as any American filmmaker The script is an overlong mess the thing simply doesnt make any sense with scenes which seem like they are from a different film sequences which make no logical sense or are not explained in any way  Kairo is also the most downright boring film Ive sat through this year At two hours long this is a real chore to sit through I really wanted to fastforward it but Im fair if nothing else so I stuck it out to the bitter end  frankly wished I hadnt There are so many things wrong with Kairo I suppose the filmmakers were going for a surreal ambiguous  deliberately incoherent feel but those are traits which I despise in a film unless they are done properly Then theres the whole internet thing which I just couldnt relate to at all I use the internet all day  its not in the least bit scary to me in any way Then theres the fact that Kairo as a film provided zero entertainment value for me maybe Im a Neanderthal but I kind of like the films I watch to entertain me make some sort of sense  not bore me to deathbr br Director Kurosawa has made the ultimate insomnia cure as far as Im concerned if you have trouble getting to sleep stick this in the DVD  you be fast asleep within 10 minutes I guarantee you I didnt think Kairo was scary in the slightest the whole internet thing was laughable  as for scary you should see some of the penis enlargement popup ads I get now thats scary I hate this film I hate this film Im sorry I just need to make that basic point again twice Forget about any action tension or gore as there isnt any If you have a very nervous disposition then there are maybe a couple of scenes which might creep you out otherwise this is kiddie friendly PG rated stuff all the way Urghbr br The film looks so dull  boring its untrue the camera just sits there for very long shots  when it does move it moves very slowly this has all the style of a Mexican soap opera Since Kairo is sub titled its difficult to judge the original performances so I wont bother its hard to care for someone when they dont even speak the same language  you dont know what they are sayingbr br Kairo is crap I hated it  its as simple  straight forward as that Just because its an Asian flick doesnt automatically make it any good  the mess of a story the plot holes the fact it makes no sense  its an absolute bore means Kairo would rightly be torn to shreds by people if it were an American production The worst film Ive seen this year by some distance Kairo got a Hollywood remake as Pulse 2006,negative

OK I am not Japanese I do know a little about Japanese culture and a little less about Japanese pop culture Other than that I am Spanish I eat paella and I like black humorbr br Good with that point set I can comment on the movie I have no idea on how it is enjoyable to the Japanese audiences Mamoru Oshii is quite a good director despite the overly pedantic postmodern stuff in the style of Talking Head and even that was curious and somehow interesting and I am surprised he came up with this It may just be one of those lostintranslation cases I am afraid it is but as a European viewer watching the film with subtext overloaded English subtitles I just thought it was horrible The jokes seemed bad the script was overcooked I mean give the audience a break and shut up a little you damn narrator to the point of almost making my head explode over an overkill of fastpaced speaking and absurd actionbr br However I thought the animation was really cool The idea is great and it is well exploited in those animated scenes However the eyecandy finishes as soon as the characters are left aside to start with an endless not funny at all mumbojumbo speech over still pictures It just makes you want to fast forward to the next cutout hysterical characters scenebr br I read Mamoru Oshii is actually planning on a sequel for this The idea was good but horribly exploited Maybe the second part will bring up the good parts of this first one and actually make an interesting movie or maybe it will be more and more overnarrated scenes But hell if you thought Talking Head was dense Amazing Lifes of Fast Food Gifters will give cause you a strokebr br Of course all this comment is based on the experiences of someone who is European Probably this is totally useless to Japanese people maybe it was a really funny film lost in cultural frontiers and translation Maybe,negative

I didnt know the real events when I sat down to watch this just the fact that this was based upon a true story After the death of the kids father Rhonda tries to help her daughter Desiree I did not know anyone actually named their offspring that cope with the loss This is really made for children as is often the case with family flickswith that said go ahead and get everyone together for a viewing though Id keep teenagers out of it unless youre sure theyre gonna buy the concept but it doesnt downplay the sting that the death of a parent is and it doesnt really talk down to anyone The plot is sufficiently interesting and moves along well enough Acting varies with the excellent Burstyn outshining most of her fellow cast Mathis following that pretty well and Ferland and her peerswith a few exceptions being the least convincing of the bunchand frankly theyre irritating then again Im not really in the intended audience for this thing The editing and cinematography are standard and certainly not less than that While humor is limited to a handful of amusing lines or so the tone is not an unpleasant one There is an intense scene or two in this I recommend this to fans of these types of movies 710,positive
People expect no less than brilliant when Steven Spielberg directs a movie and this movie is no exception Some movies I love did poorly at the box office but Im glad to say this movie isnt one of them over nine million dollars which I dont think was bad for back then The characters were fun the animation was clear and not fuzzy and the music was modern too which is unusual for an animated movie I didnt think Professor Screw Eyes or his Scary Cirus was too scary for little kids the targeted audience for this movie but I thought what happened to the creepy professor at the end was a little too dark for a kids movie Overall this movie is a fun and enchanting classic that I have loved dearly for years,positive
I dont think Ive ever been so bowled over by the sheer absurdity of a movie in my entire life as i was when i walked out of this piece of crap NOTHING in it makes any sense none of it is clever or well thought out out of lack of truly suspenseful moments they repeatedly use that total copout trick where you build up the music before the character does something like open a door or push aside a curtain and then nothings there thats OK to do once maybe but i counted three times there are things thrown in for no apparent reason characters halfformed story lines the characters werent well developed at ALL the ending was bad bad bad bad everything every component of this film is terrible and Im just here to warn you all of that,negative
This littleknown comedy from the hit play by Ruth Gordon is a delight The script based on the play is spicy rich and completely undated Ditto the cast but I must underline the work of the leading ladyIrene Dunne Irene is simply superb  as usual  and lights up the screen with every frame shes in and shes in it a lot thank heaven In addition director Vidor has given her some unusual closeups that are mesmerizing What a gal I know of no other Hollywood actress from any era who has her versatility and is so convincing in every film Why she remains so little known is a mystery I have seen most of her films and this one was a surprise even for a solid ID fan like myself See it everyone,positive
RVAMs reputation preceded it I first heard of it in one of those Medved style movie books The 50 Worst Movies Ever or The Golden Turkey Awards or something like that Every review of the film basically said that this movie was so bad that it would make you bleed from the eyes to watch it So when the Exposed Film Society finally got around to showing it I was anticipating the kind of cathartic experience that only a true cinematic stinker can provide br br However Robot wasnt really all that bad br br Oh this is definitely a Z film through and through Some of the voice dubbing as is usually the case for K Gordon Murray imports is awfully cheesy and the movie itself seems to be structurally something of a Frankenstein since a huge chunk of it seems to be footage from a previous Aztec Mummy movie narrated with a voiceover by the leading man A dead giveaway anytime the question Then what happened is asked more than twice in the dialog you are looking at reassembled footage put together with little regard for plot coherence or momentum In RVAM Then what happened or What happened then is uttered at least four times in the 1st hour br br Even without the structural problems the plot and dialog dont translate well to an older American audience For instance as the hero explains and explains and explains the backstory he includes a remark about Doctor Krupp a doctor who suddenly turned into an evil master criminal and began his quest for the treasure that the Aztec mummy guards No background no explanation he just suddenly turned evil Obviously this was aimed at a pretty undiscriminating audience br br The clincher though is the Robot the supposed showcase of this movie This Robot is the worst robot special effect since Undersea Kingdom or even Santa Claus Vs The Martians Compared to this hunk of junk the Tin Man from the Wizard Of Oz looked like the Terminator chassis that chased Linda Connor through the foundry in T2 The Aztec Mummy himself is well designed and executed hes recognizably undead familiar enough to look like a mummy and yet distinct from the Boris Karloff bandage collection familiar to most American audiences But whoever designed the Robot in this followup had no feel for the conceptor no budget They could at least have given him some knees for heavens sake br br In addition the titular battle is terribly executed and lasts less than 60 seconds Ive seen shoving matches on junior high playgrounds that are more convincing Then the movie basically just stops That seems a bit of a rip off considering the amount of time the movie spends building up to the battle itselfbr br In spite of all these problems the movie isnt horrible or incompetent the way a Coleman Francis film or a Larry Buchanan film was Compared to Monster AGoGo or Attack of The Eye Creatures RVTAM is like a Coppola film Its just kind of dull and boring and silly The actors are competent in a mannered B movie way and reasonably photogenic Dr Krupp in particular seems to be having a wonderful time as he leers and plots and capers about in his cape and Phantom Of the Opera suit I often found myself rooting for him in spite of his being the villain br br Anyway Ive seen much much worse File this with Samson Vs The Vampire Women under interesting Mexican juvenile oddities,negative
I can not believe such slanted jingoistic material is getting passed off to Americans as art house material Early on from such telling lines like we want to make sure they are playing for the right team and manipulative framing and lighting A Love Divided shows its true face The crass manner in which the Irish Catholics are shown as hegemonic the Protestants as peaceful and downtrodden is as poor a representation of history as early US westerns that depict the struggle between cowboys and American Indians The truth of the story is distorted with the stereotypes and outright vilification of the Irish Catholics in the story a corruption admitted by the filmmakers themselves It is sad that people today still think that they can win moral sway by making a film so easily recognized for its obvious intent so far from attempting art This film has no business being anywhere in any legitimate cinema or library,negative
This was talked about to death by the critics when it honestly isnt that great Sure CHAOS and INSIDE MAN are literally the same movie just with variations in suspense But I found CHAOS more enjoyable because it was fast paced kinda like the silly film Swordfish The reason this film is more popular is because this got released in the States and Chaos was aired all around the world at film festivals and foreign theaters but has yet to find a distributor in the UK and USA br br Its true that this film makes lots of tributes to classic films like DOG DAY AFTERNOON and other Spike Lee films but that doesnt mean that it is a pleasant film to watch br br Watch it if nothing else is on TV but youll probably get bored with after awhile,negative

Excellent drama about 2 alienated spoiled punks who go afoul of the federal government each for his own reasons One a druggie just wants to score some bucks for his next fix but the other has a far more sinister agenda fueled in part by a resentment of his father Good performances and a hot script makes this a winner,positive
This drama apparently caused a bit of a stir six years ago when it debuted on television  not taking in much TV news myself it passed under the radar but after having seen it Im not surprised that it did cause a stir Not particularly because of the content although it is a bit more offbeat than the usual TV fodder  it has more to do with the reactionary media in this country Anyway this three part series is based on a book by Sarah Waters and puts its main focus on lesbians  although the plot also has room to explore some other dark sides of sexuality Our main character is an oyster girl named Nan short for Nancy from Winchester She is bewitched by female to male drag performer Kitty Butler after seeing her at a theatre show and soon begins attending all of her shows  eventually catching the eye of the performer and becoming her dresser Its not long before Kitty is offered a chance to play on bigger stages in London and having become good friends with Nan she invites her along for the ride The act gets bigger when Nan takes to the stage also and the pair becomes a stage duobut Kitty breaks Nans heart leading her into an odyssey within Londons seedy underbellybr br I must admit that my DVD collection contains no shortage of sleazy and sordid films so there wasnt anything in this one that was enough to shock me Despite being rather jaded to it I have to say that Im still surprised at anyone who says this film went too far naturally there is some lesbian sex and other stuff but its never exploitative or overused and the film really couldnt have been made without it The main focus is always on the story and the story is really well done The film is almost three hours long in total but if anything that isnt long enough to get everything across Sarah Waters is obviously an inventive writer and the film remains interesting for the duration The acting is solid as you would expect but I must admit that I found lead actress Rachael Stirling awkward and hard to get on with at first although she grows into her role well as the film progresses The execution is a little bit of a problem and director Geoffrey Sax is a bit too gimmicky for my liking The story does get a little bit sappy towards the end also which is a shame because this film is at its strongest during the dark moments episode 2 being the high point of three for me Theres not really a defined point to the film  or at least not one that I could see Thats not important as far as Im concerned however as Tipping the Velvet tells a good story and more than surpassed my expectations Worth checking out for people that like this sort of stuff,positive
Dont even ask me why I watched this The only excuse I can come up with that I was sick with Bronchitis and too weak to change the channel  Its too terrible for words the movie that is not the Bronchitis The acting is deplorable Richard Grieco hams it up as a triggerhappy gunslinging serial killer with a penchant for knocking off cops Nick Mancuso phones in a performance as the cop on his trail and Nancy Allen manages to put in the only sympathetic role in the entire film The script is dismal peppered with clichéd lines Are you ready Pardner purrs Richard Grieco to every single one of his victims Dire Avoid,negative

I first saw the live musical at the Denver Center For The Performing Arts and it was absolutely mindblowing Stunning and had such fantastic continuity of plot and dialogue that I liked it much more than most musicals that I have seen on the stage The interesting thing is that you NEVER got to see Zachs face He was always in the dark but his presence was powerful and guided the direction of entire production Whe I heard they were making a movie from it I waited with bated breath but when I watched the movie version I was so bummedout disappointed that I felt I was cheated The movie lacks the captivating mood set in the live production and it never allows you to be completely in close touch with every character Personally I would like to see the live version again and if that should ever be revived I would wholeheartedly recommend that you go out of your way to see it It will be one of the most memorable experiences you will enjoy,negative

Yesterday I watched this tv production and I was very disappointedbr br I didnt have big expectations when it was a tv production but the complete movie was pain with no ending I felt it lasted for 3 hours but it was just me who was bored to death Every minute was a long struggle and I really fought hard to stay away from the turn offswitchbr br The movie is about a doctor Dr Verghese who gets a lot of AIDSpatients and most of them die during the movie It is hard for Verghese to live with so his family gets punished with his frustrations However this movie has problems showing both sides it mostly focuses on his conversations with the patients and sometimes we see flicks from his home but we dont get much The difficulties to show more than one part of Vergheses life doesnt get any better with the poor acting from Naveen Andrews a man I hopefully cant see in any good future moviesbr br I believe it got 76 because of the subject taboo but Im sure that there are better movies about this subject on the market Stay away from this movie it does not deserve more than 310br br ,negative
Such great actors such a disappointment Marlon Brando plays and awful character the movie is not funny at all a subconscious message can be seen IT IS A DAMN CRAP IT SUUCKS SO BADLY THROW YOUR TV THROUGH WINDOW and so on It is simply disgusting and irksome In addition to foolish plot sense of humor there is something else The way the rooms are decorated the colors It makes me sick everything is so colourful that it might cause epilepsy Usually I do not care about the decoration in movie but this from Free Money made me angry Avoid at all costs Free Money  probably for Charlie Sheen Sutherland and Brando but a viewer gets nothing One watches it at cost of sanity,negative

The story idea behind THE LOST MISSILE isnt bad at all but unfortunately the story does get a bit dull towards the middle and the overuse of stock footage as well as poor special effects sink this film to the subpar levelbr br The film begins with a missile heading towards the Earth In a panic because its about to strike the Earth the Soviets manage to deflect the object This isnt necessarily good however as this seemingly unmanned craft has a vapor trail that destroys everything in its path AND the ship is now in a low orbit over the planet In other words with each pass it makes a swath of death followsone that could potentially kill us all So its up to the good scientists of the US led by a very young and hardly recognizable Robert Loggia to formulate and plan to save usand especially save New York that is in its immediate flight path Unfortunately they arent able to save Ottawa Ive never been there so I cant say whether or not this is a big loss but thanks to good old American knowhow they are able to eventually destroy this harbinger of destruction br br So as you can see the story idea isnt bad and rather original But so many old clips of fighter planes and guys manning radar scopes gets a bit old and it seemed like padding Overall a decent but hardly inspired film that extreme fans of the genre may likeall others see it at your own risk,negative

I will give it a 3 just because it showed history that we need to know about to prevent it from happening again I agree with the comments from the gentleman from UK The movie was pretty terrible All cliché no real plot Historical and technical inaccuracies abound Look up the technical specs on DE 529 or any Everts class Destroyer Escort and you will see what I mean I now its black history month in the US and Im going to be called a racist just for saying this but the history of this ship is not that great They did some escort work chased a submarine that turned out to be a hulk that they rammed Sorry but black people did a lot more in WWII then this silly movie gives them credit for This movie makes them look like whiners Let the name calling commence I can handle it,negative
The big problem I had with this movie was that Lombards character is as another user put it unnecessarily cruel Lombard plays the role of Ann Krausheimer Smith who believes she is married to David Smith played well by the sharply dressed yet appropriately bumbling Robert Montgomery The movie has some funny moments especially when Montgomerys character goes to great lengths to try to get his wife back Understandably she is upset because the marriage is technically not legal but she only finds out three years into itbr br Lombards character seems quite cold to her husbands sincere attempts to woo her back While not being highly adept in that effort Montgomery is nevertheless visibly loving and yet Lombard is as cool as a pillar of ice There are almost no clues suggesting any sort of reconciliation between the warring couple for much of the movie and it is hard to see any sort of comedy even dark comedy in that aspect To some extent the movie almost suggests a sadistic undertone with Lombards character getting a kick out of her husbands feeble efforts While one might consider this another Battle of the Sexes type of movie the reality is that it is a highly lopsided battle if that Montgomerys character while certainly flawed is not flawed enough to make it a typical exemplar of the masculine chauvinistmisogynist an excellent example of that is Michael Douglas in War of the Roses In fact the character is largely effeminate as revealed by not only the sharp dress of Montgomery which probably owes largely to the perennially sharply dressed actor himself but also to his discomfort in attemptingbut failing to play the role of a womanizing bachelor His only major flaw is his vanity but that fault does not balance out with his partners excessive cruelty And there is no suggestion that she is trying to instill any jealousy out of subconscious love This is what makes it so cruel and sad Montgomerys character simply looks weak In reality no wife would want a man so weak unless she wears the pants in the marriage But then again a woman who wears the pants in a marriage would never seek to be so cruel because she has already affirmed that role early on Hence the whole theme seems weird This movie is neither a champion of feminism Lombards character does show some signs of the sort of independentoriented woman of the 60s but that idea is soon quashed and the character falls back into the 1940s nor an evensided battle of the sexes as Montgomerys character is truly a cipher of masculinity and therefore a lost causebr br This movie is on the surface a slapstick but beneath that veneer it is really much darker with sadistic undertones All of which makes its resolution appear well odd Maybe that oddity was the whole point In any case slapstick this movie is not,negative

Sherlock Holmes films from the classic Universal era tend to range in quality This range goes from very good to above average with none of their output being abysmal or astoundingly brilliant Sherlock Holmes and The Secret Weapon fits snugly into the middle ground qualitywise and as ever its an enjoyable outing that fans of the series like myself will enjoy very much This film sees Holmes in the middle of a World War 2 plot by the evil Nazis to steal a Swiss scientists invention which could turn out to be a key element on the battlefield The World War 2 Sherlock Holmes films dont tend to be as good as the ones such as The Scarlet Claw where Holmes is conducting private investigations as theyre usually dogged by too much propaganda or a plot that is more to do with the war than the mystery This one however pretty much stays away from both and by putting the focus on Holmes and his investigation the film works much better Perhaps Universal saw what brought down the earlier Voice of Terror and changed the focus because of thatbr br Basil Rathbone once again puts in an excellent maverick performance as the ace detective and while Nigel Bruce doesnt feature as much as normal its nice to see him when he does The two dont spent much time together which is disappointing because their chemistry is always one of the best things about Holmes films but this does allow more time for Holmes to showboat in various disguises which is always lots of fun Dennis Hoeys Lestrade is definitely my favourite of the secondary characters and while hes not as funny as usual his facial expressions are great and his presence helps to emphasise how great Holmes is His scene with Watson in a car following paint drops on the road is my favourite moment of the film Its good to see Holmes nemesis Professor Moriarty return even if it does seem like hes just been thrown in for the hell of it Lionel Atwills performance isnt as good as George Zuccos in The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes as he never really convinces that he is indeed a brilliant mind but seeing him lock horns with the protagonist is fun and its nice to see him in the film to offset the World War 2 themes which are never as interesting as Holmes himself The film starts off as more of a thriller than a mystery flick but once it gets going its hard to put down and this is a more than solid entry in Universals oeuvre,positive

I do not expect this film to be well understood by viewers out of Romania This tells something certainly about the value or maybe about the lack of universality of the film but also tells something about how different history and even life of common people was in Romania compared to other countries even in Eastern Europebr br The film is an adaptation of a novel by Marin Preda a controversial novelist who died during the Communist rule soon after the book was published It tells the story of an intellectual professor of philosophy whose life is crushed after he is imprisoned on false accusations at the end of the Stalinist era Basically the first part of the film tells the story of his fight for survival in prison the second describes his tentative to regain his life after being released His release is actually only apparent Romania of the 60s asks from him different types of compromises and crimes but yet his fight for survival is as tough morally as in prisonbr br The film is splendidly acted by some of the best Romanian actors Stefan Iordache who has the lead role would be in another time and another place a megastar we can get here a good glimpse of his fabulous acting art Although suffering from a hesitant storytelling and falling sometimes in nonessential details or character comics the film is still an important landmark for the Romanian cinema as well as for the process of recovering the moral and historic values in the Romanian society,positive

I first saw this in the 70s on syndicated TV and admired its production values which were high tech for the time The remastered video is rich and colorful far more intense then the pale 35 mm TV prints This movie deserves more attention it paved the way for UFO Space 1999 and even Star Wars with its detailed miniatures and cleverly conceived gadgets Sure the story of an alternative antimatter planet Earth has been recycled a hundred times since Star Trek but the beauty of this film is its selfconscious European flair for design from the Rolls Royce space engines to the Euro Sec letterhead business paper JFSS or Dopplegangers as it was called in Europe is enjoyable for the imaginary vision of Europe in space in the shadow of the Superpowers Gerry and Sylvia Andersons ambitious epic gets a little tedious when the American astronaut finally realizes that he is on the doppleganger Earth and everything is literally downhill after the poetically graceful shuttle boarding sequence A mediocre story is helped along by a grand and lyrical classical score by the late great Barry Gray the John Williams of Britain,positive

Absolutely the worst film yet by Burton who seems to be getting worse with each film he directs A miserable script loaded with cliches is only the first of many objectionable aspects to this film This is the kind of movie where every time something happens youll be sure to hear someone shout out hes lost his gun or whatever it is to let everybody know Carter is really awful and so is Wahlberg who cant play this straight and be convincing Very nice effects and photography but poor music in the John Williams mold by Burtons crony Elfman Heston appears in a nonsensichal scene to spout out his most famous catchphrases from the first movie Very poor resultsbr br If anyone else out there also saw Sleepy Hollow they will probably have noticed as I have the declining quality of Burtons films Ive heard that this particular project was produced by others and that Burton was brought in as director in which case his judgement should be questioned But I think he has allowed any possible vision he might have had earlier in his career to slip the evidence is there in the films In Sleepy Hollow he couldnt decide what kind of movie he was making whether it was a comedy or a real horror movie and the population of british character actors Chris Lee etc made you also think it was kind of a monster rally film those are never scary as horror fans know The movie couldnt succeed on either horror or comedy because it was so schizophrenic and no style had been developed to smooth the two together Planet of the Apes is much the same way and the result comes off more like Total Recall or Tango and Cash than like scifi Hes also fallen into the rut of so many other big directors of trying to satisfy the entire possible audience Word to Burton if youre out there  pick something and do it straight or use some style to peice it all together as in Mars Attacks or Beetlejuice or you might as well retire because people like me that are fans of your movies will stop going,negative

This has to be one of the best movies to come out of HK in a long time i was eagerly waiting to get my hands on this movie just looking at the title Loads of fantastic actors in this show and i was particularly impressed with Sam Lees impossibly believable insane behavior and Edisons portrayal of a killer machine which totally reversed his normal idol image i would definitely recommend to those looking for a stylish and action packed movie However i must warn you this is also an equally depressing movie as every character in the movie is in some kind of dead end and trouble of their own and struggling to breathe Makes you think about what is life about really,positive
Gruveyman2 comment belowyou are a complete idiotblinded by ignorance by the very city you have allegiance to Its that whiny arrogance that you are ironically claiming the film exudes about SF that makes you seem like such the typical LA Ahole The only reason you felt the film was so self congratulatory about SF is because you are jealous Of course you dont know it because you are so LA jaded First of all the film was completely factual about a beautiful city what has been filmed there and what has been filmed by some of its more famous locals It says nothing bad about LA and these accomplished directors choose to live in a beautiful city over LA They recognize that they went to film school in LA and are obviously proud of that fact They recognize that SF is close to LA which is a benefit The only negative thing that was said that relates to LA was about the studio executives The same studio executives that hated these guys movies when they first saw them but then those same movies went on to be huge worldwide grossing films So why wouldnt they have animosity towards the studio executive establishment and studio system These are the only people they are trying to disassociate from and for good reasons Dont be so sensitive How can you say that Francis Ford Coppola is the so called San Francisco director How is he not to be considered that And who directed The Godfather Coppola did It was his vision that told the story on the screen that won it a best picture award So what who gave him the job He admits it in the documentary that he didnt even want to do the movieso whats your point And so what if Sophia wants to live in LA And that proves your point how And tell me how they are not truly independent when they are funding a lot of their own movies Movies that are now considered classics And when they made movies from studio funding one it was LA that came to them and said we want you to make these pictures and two they used the money that they made from doing these pictures to fund their own They said exactly that in the filmbr br Your bitchy and self congratulatory whining would take on an air of greater self respect and credence if you never set foot on the ground you so claim to be superior to in this filmbr br How the hell can bitchyness and selfcongratulation suddenly have an air of self respect and credenceif they never go to LA again What a stupid and senseless comment You inserted some big words in thereand just dont know how to use them And by the way they never claimed nor implied they were superior to LA So what if they are giving a guy from New York an award in LAagain what the hell is your point So if they go to LA or New York they are hypocrites by simply preferring to live in SF You make no sensebr br San Francisco is proud of itself and its heritage and the people who make it what it is today This film just focused on one aspectfilmmaking For you to take the time and type up such nasty comments about the city not the movie But the city and its people only proves what it is we Northern Californians hate about people from LA THIS IS A GREAT DOCUMENTARYVERY INTERESTING ESPECIALLY IF YOU ARE FROM THE BAY AREABUT I RECOMMEND IT TO ANYONE,positive

well i may be bias as i grew up watching a VHS copy of this film that is now ready to snap and have just spent the last couple of hours tracking down a DVD copy as a birthday pressie for my Dad The film is so harmless and inoffensive it suits all ages much better than anything Disney ever made in my opinion and i used to work in the Disney Store The characters are enjoyable and the award for best scene is a tie between the disrupted wedding especially the musical talents of Swat the fly and Smack the mosquito and the amazing night club scene The musical numbers still have me humming 20 years after i first watched it there is no other film that i can better recommend whilst babysitting and in fact every child i know thanks to my Hoppity loving parents have seen this film many times It will always get top marks for its fabulous love story a brilliant baddy and over all originality,positive

In The Book of Life Martin Donovan plays Jesus who shows up at JFK airport on December 31 to usher in the new millennium by battling with Thomas Jay Ryan Satan and deciding the fate of the world There is also David Simonds Kurt the accountant from Amateur as a compulsive homeless gamblerbr br As usual Hartley creates a surreal world in which the beauty of the ordinary made strange and otherworldly flows through artfullyframed scenes and urbanindustrial landscapes filled with dazzling light and shadow As usual he introduces seemingly incidental details early then brings them back later in hilarious and unexpected contextsthe humor is simple but giddy and irrepressible Hartley has an amazing ability to build toward small and rapturous moments of the simultaneously mundane and outrageous As usual he creates a tone that is jaded and worldweary but at the same time vulnerable open and honest He moves within minutes from uproarious humor into language that is metaphysical and poeticthe kind of writing that is so deadon and perfect that its difficult to hold back tears despite the lack of obvious emotion Another awesome and highly entertaining filmbr br The Book of Life is shot a digital camera with a blurry effect a sense of the celestial handinhand with impending doom and a hyperawareness of the present as fragile and fleeting in its last moments All of Hartleys films have a way of prioritizing the present but this unique effect compounds it as the images wash across the screen in a way that is at first jarring but becomes increasingly beautiful as you settle into it The final shot is spectacular All this may sound precious but the film is a comedy and it makes fun of itself even as it makes fun of the concept of Armageddon Judgment Day and urbanity Although it is actually quite profound moving and lifeaffirming it is for the most part lighthearted and playful The acting is flawless in terms of the kind of the subdued tone that Hartley has developed in his films a tone that some people dont get and that prompts them to judge such acting as hollowthe same people who have a negative response to Peter Greenaway As always there are bound to be people who respond to this film with cynicism and scornpeople put off by Hartleys abrupt shifts and what they see to be pretentious or mannerist techniquesbut anyone who is a Hartley fan will love this film if they can get a chance to see it that is Its hard to say what it would be like on video,positive
This movie caught me by surprise For years I have avoided many of Harold Lloyds sound pictures as well as those of Keaton because they have a generally welldeserved reputation for being lousy compared to the silent films because the basic formula has been lost However when I saw this film I was pleasantly surprised to find I actually liked itonce I accepted it really was not a Harold Lloyd film despite him starring in it This is because although it is nothing like the style of his earlier films it IS highly original and Lloyd isnt bad playing a totally different type of characterbr br As I mentioned above the formula of the old films is almost completely missing here Lloyd does not do the old familiar stunt work the romance is quite unlike his early screen romances and the plot is just plain weird Instead of the usual roles he is the son of a Chinese missionary who returns to America for the first time since he was a small boy Because of this though he looks like an American except for his white suit and explorers helmet he thinks and acts a lot like someone who is Chinese In many ways hes very naive about America and is like an innocent among wolves Early on he meets a man who turns out to be a local party boss This boss ALWAYS produces a losing candidate for the mayoral racebecause he is bought and paid for by the corrupt mayor to produce a token candidate who has NO CHANCE of winning Well the old geezer who they traditionally run for office just died and he decides to run the naive Lloydhe hasnt a prayer of winning Well the unthinkable happens and Lloyd wins This and Lloyds decision to clean up the town greatly upsets the old political machine and they stop at nothing to destroy honest Lloyd Just when it appears Lloyd is headed to jail on a trumped up corruption charge he creates a scheme that is 100 impossible and very illegal to get signed confessions from the crooks However despite this it is incredibly funny and a great ending So my advice is at the end just suspend disbelief and enjoybr br An important note This movie is definitely NOT politically correct The word Chink is used repeatedly I found it offensive but considering the times I ignored it as you should too If however you are someone who CANT and like being angry I suggest you never watch movies anywayas you are bound to become offended again and again,positive

We all have friends Some of us have more than others but there really are only one or two people that you feel really close with people that you can say are like your brother or sister Alice  Danes and Darlene  Beckinsale  are like that You can see that from the beginning They graduated together they go to parties together and they decide to go to Bangkok together when they were supposed to be going to Hawaii They also get busted for attempting to smuggle drugs into a third world country and that spells disaster The rest of the film is about survival and not giving up hope It also has a strong message about the power of friendship and what it can mean to someonebr br Brokedown Palace is a very good film it is not excellent and that is due to a few issues that I want to talk about But first I want to say what is good about the film And for starters the acting is top notch and you can look no further than the two leads Danes and Beckinsale are perfect in the roles that they have Alice is always fiery and seems a little rough around the edges but she seems more fun than Darlene But sometimes that fun can get her into trouble Darlene is always a little on the conservative side and although that can get irritating sometimes it would have served the two girls better if her way was adhered to instead of Alices Bill Pullman is adequate as the American lawyer living in Thailand The film is photographed very well also The inside of the prison while not the same as Shawshank or Natural Born Killers or Return To Paradice but it does show the necessary  but underdone hopelessness of the situation that they are in Johnathin Kaplans direction is quite good as well We see the two girls struggling to make it through each day but you can see their spirit is being put out a little more each day Brokedown Palace is excellent when it talks about friendship and it shows how they have to rely on each other to survive The other thing that I had to comment on is the soundtrack for the film It heightens and compliments the mood of the film to perfection The song that you hear in the trailer is also played in the film and when it plays you feel the plight of the women in this prison You can feel how alone they must feel and how desperate they are to get out and get back to the simple things in life And it also makes you look at yourself and realize how lucky we are to live in the society that we do We have it easy compared to some countrys and believe it or not the music is a perfect catalyst for reflection on this subject Some of the music is done by a group called Delirium  I think  but it is Sara McLaughlin wrong spelling but how do you spell her last name  that does the lyrics and her voice is beautiful and haunting and it adds so much to the filmbr br What I didnt enjoy about the film was some of the stupidity that the girls exhibit I wont say what it is that they do but when you see it for yourself youll know what I am talking about Also I didnt really feel that the prison they were in was all that bad It looked more like a minimum security prison and that may be because when there are similar circumstances in other films that invlove men doing time in a foreign country the prison scenes are always brutal and sadistic But I didnt get that herebr br Overall this is a great film and it really does make you ask the question  How far would you go for a friend  That is a tough question and maybe one that none of us could honestly answer until put into the same situation Lets just hope that it never comes down to that,positive

Early Jackie Chan film where there is no sign of the Chan persona we know This is Chan in a full on traditional revenge tale of the sort that was cloned and recloned by countless producers and studios all through Hong Kong Taiwan and Mainland China Its a very serious story that shows none of the humor and warmth that would catapult Jackie Chan to super stardom Its also clear from watching this that had he not reinvented himself odds are we would never have known him because his career would have been painfully short As a film on its own merits this is a good looking but pretty unremarkable movie I was watching it in the midst of an all day marathon of martial arts films and it would have blended together with every other film that I watched that day had I not noticed Jackie in the film Honestly I dont think the film is really worth bothering with there are too many other better variations except if youre interested in seeing where Jackie Chan started,negative

A lack of character development proves fatal for this movie Valeria Golinos character Grazia starts out looking like a bipolar personality but quickly degenerates into a caricature and seems unreal The other characters are thin probably the writers fault not the actors The only exception is Filippo Pucillo as the younger son Filippo his energy and bravado are funny and convincingbr br I suppose the childrens petty cruelty is supposed to contribute to an atmosphere of bleakness and emphasize the pervasive primal spirits in the town but for me the gratuitous cruelty is redundant and contributes to the overall boredom of the film Some scenes were amusing but not necessarily intended that way for example when the mistreated dogs turn out to be fat and healthy and look like they are ready to show The pretty cast and setting make for an appealing trailer but cannot carry the whole movie,negative

This trashy B movie attempts to masquerade as a study of sexual addiction but it is really a poor excuse for a sexploitation flick The story revolves around Sammy Horn subtle name played by Michael Des Barres Sammy is a restaurant owner with a clueless wife Grace Rosanna Arquette and a young child He has a sexual addiction and must have meaningless sex every five minutes with any woman in his field of vision who will agree and of course every woman on the planet finds him irresistible despite the fact that he looks old enough to be collecting Social Securitybr br The story is centered on a conversation with his therapist Nastassja Kinski where he is describing each of his sexual exploits via flashback This is nothing more than a convenient launching point for a parade of serial sex acts which consumes at least 75 of the screen timebr br It is hard to know where to begin criticizing a film this bad The production values are abysmal The movie is shot on video with a look somewhere between a TV soap opera at best and an amateur porn flick shot in someones garage The direction by Joseph Brutsman is horrible with bad lighting uninspired framing and poor actor direction The script is vapid and the dialogue mindless and vulgarbr br Women are generally portrayed as sex obsessed nymphomaniacs just waiting for an addict like Sammy to come along and rough them up while feeding their insatiable appetites with some impersonal copulation As an example Graces sister comes over to indignantly inform Sammy that she knows hes been sleeping around and that she is going to tell his wife His response to that is to throw her up against the wall and begin raping her About three seconds into it she has an epiphany and is instantly converted to one of his sex disciples begging him to give her more Just as they finish Grace walks in and sis says to her Oh great to see you gotta run to pick up Timmy and mums the word about Sammys indiscretions The bond of loyalty has been sealed with a good ravishment No spoiler here because it is so typical of the obvious nature of the film that anyone who had seen the first fifteen minutes could have predicted itbr br The sex depictions are all overdone mechanical and so poorly simulated that they are more comical than erotic Most of them are done with both participants fully clothed The acting is wretched Michael Des Barres presents all the depth of a rain puddle He really seems to get into the thrusting and profanity of the sex parts but when it comes to actually acting with Arquette and Kinski he is adrift Rosanna Arquette is the closest thing to an actor in this film giving a bearable performance and looking genuinely hurt when she finally discovers that her perfect husband is a lecherous animal Nastassja Kinski is far too compassionate as the therapist but at least we have some acting happening here The rest of the cast is just a collection of elevated body doubles to whom they give thought provoking lines like hit me harder is that the best you can do and Oh GodYESbr br This movie is among the worst I have ever seen a dubious distinction given the thousands of films I have viewed I have given it the extremely rare dishonor of rating it 110 Not to be seen within three hours of any meal,negative
In 1948 this was my alltime favorite movie Betty Grables costumes were so ravishing that I wanted to grow up to be her and dress like that Douglas Fairbanks Jr was irresistible as the dashing Hungarian officer Silly and fluffy as this movie might appear at first when I was eight years old it seemed to me to say something important about relations between men and women I saw it again the other day I was surprised to find that it still did,positive
For years I hesitated watching this movie Now I know why Not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny but theres also just nothing to laugh at about the movie It was even worse than Id expected I rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money I have never seen a film that annoyed me that much It is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things I dont really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie I have used IMDb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or worse buying this stinker Really a waste of time and money I must say that the plot line is awful,negative

Its a strange thing to see a film where some scenes work rather weakly if only in comparison to other films in its legacy and others in a subplot or supporting story are surprisingly provocative and strong Sudden Impact is one of those cases where Clint Eastwood as starproducerdirector shows when he can be at his best or at his lessor of times when dealing with a crimemysterydetective story in his Dirty Harry fame We get that make my day line and unlike in the first film where his do I feel lucky speech was playful and cool the first time and the second time at the end tough as nails here its switched around He gets into another shamble with the department as usual when he tries to fight crime his way in particular with a diner robbery inspiration for Pulp Fiction and with a high speed pursuit with a senior citizen bus Hes told to take a vacation and thats the last thing on his mind This whole main plot isnt very convincing aside from the expectancy of the story and lines which just adds to the frustration But soon his story merges with the subplot that Eastwood develops from the startbr br Enter Sandra Lockes character Jennifer Spencer whom we soon learn after some appropriately mysterious scenes that she and her shy sister were victims of a cruel unjust sexual assault err outright rape and is sleekly undercoverlike getting revenge Her scenes and story are the strongest parts of the film the most intense and finally when it goes into Callahans storyline hes getting facts in the same small town shes in on a murder the film finally finds a focus between Eastwoods classic form of clearly defined good vs evil though sometimes blurred to be sure Eastwood films the flashbacks not to say too much about them expertly in a fresh experimental style the trademark Lalo Schifrin score is totally atmospheric in these scenes and in others It almost seems like a couple of times an arthouse sensibility has crept into Eastwoods firmly straightforward storytelling style which helps make the film watchablebr br Its a shame though that in the end it goes more for the expectable or maybe not expectable points and until the third act Callahan doesnt have much to do except his usual its smithWessonand me shtick However with Locke he gets out of her a very good performance more subtle and touching than the one in the Gauntlet and an exciting climax at an amusement park In a way I do and dont agree with Eberts remark that its like a music video in Eastwoods style here I admit there is comparisons with the simplicity of both the directness but the scenes where Eastwood does break form are superior to those of any music video Its cheesy its hardedged its not up to par with the first two Harry pictures but hey there could be worse ways to spend a couple hours with the master of the 44,positive
I thought the children in the show did a very good job I especially enjoyed the performance of the Emma character Well done The stunts were pretty good for a low budget show I was able to follow the movie and enjoy it without having to look at my watch every 5 minutesI enjoyed the scenes with the tooth fairy and the burning of her The ghostly apparitions of the childrens souls being released was also good Another good point of the movie is that it kept moving along There wasnt a lot of slow scenes The adult leads were also believable and therefore helped to keep the show entertaining All in all an enjoyable night of movie watching,positive

I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time The animation is stunning The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful From the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry I was amazed Moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh Character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand Im impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see for the entire family,positive
I just watched this today on TV It was on ABCs Sunday Afternoon Moviebr br This wasnt a very good movie but for a low budget independent film like this it was okay There is some suspense in it but there are so many bad qualities that really bring the movie down The script is pretty lame and the plot elements arent very realistic such as the way a 911 operator would laugh and hang up when someone is reporting a murder I dont know what the writer was thinking when they came up with that idea but it isnt very realisticbr br I thought this movie was going to be a good suspense thriller because there were a few scenes that seemed like they would lead to something good but unfortunately they never did There were a few plot elements that have been used in other movies similar to this and in the end didnt prove to be very creativebr br If there is something good about this movie it is the cast Every actor in this movie did good with what they had to work with The terribly underrated actress Elizabeth Pena was great in this movie She is very sexy and has an incredibly sexy voice However if you want to see a movie of hers that is really good watch the excellent animated movie The Incredibles In that movie she put her sexy voice to good usebr br What can I say this movie isnt really worth your time but the actors were good Unfortunately they were all wasted on this movie which is a real shame This movie tried to be a good suspense thriller but in the end it fell flat If you want to see a good movie that is similar to this but much better see The Hitcher If you want to see something with the cast members of this movie watch any of their other movies You can real easily pass on this movie if you ever get the chance to see it,negative

A real sudsy soap opera here as Spencer Tracy tackles the role of an illiterate until the age of 20 He marries the woman who teaches him and her ambition and his drive leads him to successbr br Success but no happiness here A neerdowell son and a faltering marriage leads to disaster and tragedy Tracy buys a railroad and succeeds only to be subjected to a disastrous rail strike and the death of 406 workersbr br The film appeared at the beginning to be uneven but is rejuvenated thanks to the excellent use of flashbacks herebr br A double separate suicide here We know that riches cant buy happiness but this is a little too far fetched Nonetheless we have riveting performances by Tracy and Colleen Moore Ms Vinson as the 2nd wife is also quite effective,positive

I suppose that today this film has relevance because it was an early Sofia Loren film She was 19 years old when the film was made in 1953br br I viewed this film because I wanted to see some of Sofia Lorens early work I was surprised when she came on camera having had her skin bronzed over in brown makeup to resemble an Ethiopian princess Surely today this would have been viewed as a slur and to be avoided in movie making It actually became annoying watching Ms Loren in skin color paint throughout the filmbr br Yes this film would have been better made if the real opera singers had made this movie Then the singing and the actual facial gestures of the real artists would have been apparent I discount the comments by others about whether the real opera singers are older and heavier in weightbr br As beautiful as Ms Loren was at age 19 and still is today the film would have been better received as though it were being performed on the stage After all we dont see beautiful young people on stage with old opera singers back stage singing from behind the curtain Do not discount the success of using heavyweight opera singers One only has to refer to the most artistically produced television commercial for the J G Wentworth Company with the opera singers on stage singing so professionally the praises of the companys product This is one of the best and entertaining TV commercials produced to datebr br The quality of the movie print also makes this production of a somewhat lesser quality The color ink has faded much and that can not be helpedbr br To improve this film on DVD the production company should add English language subtitles so that we who do not speak Italian can know what the lyrics are saying It would help the story and teach it more than the narrator giving 30 seconds of introduction to the scenesbr br Watch this film not because of the story of Aida nor the fact that this is an opera Aside from Ms Sofia Loren none of her coactors are known nor remembered by this writer Instead watch this movie if you are a fan of Ms Loren and wish to see her at age 19  no matter what the production isbr br Larry from Illinois,negative
I didnt expect a lot when i went out to see this but my god what a disappointment The original was kind of fun within its genre but this is so bad i felt abused when i left the theater Theres no plot its not funny its not enjoyable to watch its straight out embarrassing After an hour i hoped my patience would be rewarded but now i regret not leaving the theater Do yourself a favor and ignore this one see it when it comes to the small screen Or see it on budget DVD whatever you do dont waste any money on it Dont say i didnt warn you,negative

The 70s were without a doubt the golden age of madeforTV horror This is one of those that was probably churned out as an ABC movie of the week Its the old story of a house andor ghost possessing one of the new owners The movie has promise but its never realized Everything is rushed too much Tension and suspense need time to build and grow And theres nothing new Weve seen it all before and one betterbr br One final thought I dont understand why Robert Wagners character would fall for the long dead movie star when hes married to Kate Jackson for goodness sake,negative
This film by Oscar Petersson is unique Its uniqueness doesnt lie in the story since many a half brained Hollywood production has served us comparably miserable plots but rather in the thorough way that complete and utter lousiness in one aspect is joined with equal lousiness in all other aspectsbr br The dialog is worse than embarrassing Rotten acting and abysmal direction are thrown into the mix Bosnians speaking English with heavy Swedish accents add an unintentional element of humor Uninspired lightning and camerawork are icing on the turkey film cake As a sort of surprise for the audience there are a few completely unmotivated slow motion sequences where youd least expect any To add insult to injury the whole thing is cut by someone devoid of any sense of timingbr br The bad guy henchman turns good after hearing good guys speech scene in the church is the point at which is time to dethrone Ed Wood from the position as the worst director of all times Move over Ed Wood  here comes Oscar Petersson,negative
Two years passed and mostly everyone looks different some for good and some for worse I still enjoyed as much as I did the original thoughbr br Some flaws they had though like changing the Joker he now has no red lips and looks like more blackish hair and black pupils hes still voiced by Mark Hamill which is a plus I guess They made Poison Ivy more white hinting that she is becoming more like a plant and Catwomen looks much different and not as attractive as she was in the originalbr br Though costumes like Batman Batgirl Killer Croc and Scarecrow look badass especially Scarecrowbr br The show isnt as dark as the original because Batman doesnt work as alone as he used to Most of the time working with Batgirl and the new Robin Tim Drake While NightWingDick Grayson comes to the rescue often Batman gave up the yellow logo and with the black wing on his suit and seems like he got a bit bigger but still kicking tons of assbr br The show isnt as good as the original mostly because of some of the revamped characters but the stories are as exciting as ever and the dialogue is still elite Over the Edge might be one of the greatest Batman episodes ever so make sure you check that outbr br Overall 8910,positive
I put this second version of The Man Who Knew Too Much to my Top 10 Hitchcock movies Together with Frenzy its probably the most argued film among the fans of Hitchcock I consider it far better than say Rebecca which has gained unreasonably much appreciationbr br The film contains many ingenious scenes most of them have been mentioned in other reviews but thats something to be expected from Hitchcock It takes almost half an hour until things really start to happen but that time is used for preparing the following happenings which are full of intriguing suspensebr br If you can ignore the clumsy rear projections the only weakness of this film is the main villain played by Bernard Miles who is a rather flat and undeveloped character Luckily there is a creepy assassin in the form of Reggie Nalder And Hank the little boy isnt as irritating as most kids in old movies,positive
This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films I have ever seen Merhige has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jesus Christ The high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience This film is not for everyone I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation god and humanity Whether this film is a work of art or shock value trash is open to discussion,positive
I dont know why this has the fans it does and I dont know why I have even given it the score I have This is preposterous There are many a giallo where one has to suspend disbelief let the picture roll and catch up with it somewhere before it becomes delirious and some poor police officer has to eventually explain what we have seen But this has very little going for it and has overlong sequences where nothing happens and have no relevance to anything while we have to listen to a most repetitive soundtrack even by Italian standards Not a giallo this is a complete mish mash of horror ideas featuring Klaus Kinski in one his most blatant phoned in performances I reckon he turned up did a days work and cleared off leaving Mr DAmato to get others to fill in Ewa is of course pretty but no it is not enough and in the end we have seen far too much of her popping up all over the place long after we have completely lost interest in this mindless and pretentious twaddle Maybe I just wasnt in the right mood,negative
I will admit that I have seen maybe five minutes of Jerry Springer I dont consider myself a snob but I really think that I am above watching whats on his show You should try to elevate yourself above that toobr br I saw this movie as part of a social studies event I was conducting I was told that this movie really had little to do with Springer himself rather it centered on the lives of those who would appear on Springer Handled better this movie might have actually been a fascinating look at how pathetic these peoples lives actually are I will admit I felt a twinge of empathy for Connie Molly Hagan This is all she has in life How sad that she feels she must go on Jerrys show in order to resolve thisbr br I really feel sorry for Molly Hagan appearing in this Have you noticed that after this movie she has mainly been relegated to B roles on TV I will say this about Hagan She is an extremely beautiful and intelligent woman I have no doubt that she is very earnest in her acting and she tries to play her roles with a lot of empathy The problem is that Hagan cant carry a scene on her own She just doesnt have what it takes to do a lead role Her best work will always be Angel on Hermans Head a show that was not great but its heart was in the right place and when she guested on Seinfeld as Sister Roberta,negative
I cant believe that so many are comparing this movie to Argentos His work is far more imaginative and viciousand a lot more funbr br The director simply lacks the ability to build real tension The murder scenesand lets face it thats what this genre is all aboutarent interesting It was not hard to guess who the murderer was and I really didnt care when it was revealed The cinematography isnt memorable and the muchpraised 19th century Gothic atmosphere just didnt draw me in Several of the actors are quite good especially the headmistress and the sadistic girl who lords it over the younger students but theyre given very little to dobr br Yes there are undertones of incest sadomasochism and lesbianism but amazingly they add very little spice or suspense br br If youre looking for a good horror movie look elsewhere,negative

I love special effects and witnessing new technologies that make science fiction seem real The special effects of this movie are very good I have seen most of this movie since its been airing on HBO for the past couple of months I must admit I MAY have missed a few scenes but Im usually drawn into movies and have seen some scenes more than once But every time I see some of Hollow Man I feel depressed almost like a film noir Im not sure why perhaps its that I dont want Kevin Bacon to be evil and theres disappointment in that But I think its witnessing just HOW relentlessly evil he becomes Regardless I can recommend this movie for excitement although some parts move slowly but I do NOT recommend for youngsters under the age of 14 perhaps 12 if they are mature,negative

ELEPHANT WALK was a thoroughly dull film and I really was quite happy when finally a herd of elephants stormed through the mansion and ended this film Considering the money and cast youd sure expect the film to be a lot better though I also question the odd casting of Dana Andrews as a man who is in love with Elizabeth Taylor Its not just the age difference but I just cant see the pair as a couple Perhaps some of this may be the fault of substituting Miss Taylor for Vivian Leigh at the last minute due to Miss Leighs deteriorating mental conditionthough I also have a hard time visualizing Andrews and Leigh as well In addition for an English woman Miss Taylor doesnt even seem to try using an accentbr br The film begins with Peter Finch and Taylor meeting and marrying in England Their plan is to return to Finchs tea plantation in Ceylon Sri Lanka and at first it seems like a good life However there are no women to talk with and the household staff seem to resent her On top of that once back home Finch behaves like a boorish jerk and Taylor is miserable Neighbor Andrews can see this and he declares his undying passion for her However Taylor isnt yet ready to abandon her marriage But through the course of the film Finch treats Liz more and more like an object and finally she is ready to leavewhen out of the blue Cholera strikes the plantation So its up to Andrews Finch and Taylor to work together to save the daythough by this point I really didnt care as there is absolutely no chemistry between the characters the dialog is pretty dull and you cant understand why Taylor didnt leave her weasel husband within days of arriving in this inhospitable hellbr br The film isnt particularly engaging or convincing and despite a decent budget by Paramount the film is a sluggish mess I particularly was surprised that although the film appeared to be filmed on location many scenes were clearly filmed in a studio with a rear projected and grainy shot that wasnt integrated well In one scene for instance Taylor Finch and the lot are sitting on the veranda and the grass is bright green Then when the picture cuts to people dancing right in front of them the grass is brown Its clear they really are NOT in Ceylon in this scene or the scene with the giant reclining Buddha My advice is to skip this one or at least keep a pot of coffee nearby to keep you awake Despite its budget its just not a very good or inspired filmbr br By the way could Miss Taylor have been pregnant during part of this film In some scenes particularly at the beginning shes wearing billowy clothes has a doublechin and looks puffy This isnt a criticismafter all women do get pregnant But if you look carefully youll see what I meanbr br Also by the way the basic plot in many ways is similar to GIANTa great Taylor film indeed Its amazing how casting and decent direction can do so much,negative
please rewatch all 3 series and do not go see this movie the trailer is completely misleading and the 3 weakest characters in the series stretch a badly thought out 25min TV episode into the most painful 2hrs of my life truly an awful film tubbs and edward are in it for a few mins micky has 1 line and her lipp just reels out the same tired old puns also mr brisss accent just changes about 5 times in the film tons of badly acted extras and really a few laughs that they seem to recycle for 2 hrs i honestly feel this series has been completely ruined by this godawful piece of crapbatman and robin all is forgiven,negative
Sorry if I disappoint anyone about what I am about to say to this made for TV movie But I paid money for the movie and turned out this movie is disaster The directing is really awfully bad But after I looked up its information here I realized there might be reasons for the low quality of directing and producing Maybe they dont have budget but anyway Ang Lees Sense and Sensibility had little money too but it turned out a hit The director in this movie did really bad job in telling the story and the movie couldnt even keep up a rational continuity in itself It keeps pulling me outta scenes Maybe someone need to work hard on story line board The dubbed sound is also awfully bad My god Normally I would appreciate every movie because behind it lie ideas and imaginations of an individual but this time I am just mad  I really wanna hit something HARD Just dont do the job if someone cant fulfill it to its best Bad arts its not even art what is it really hurt people,negative
Must have to agree with the other reviewer This has got to be the WORST movie let alone western I have ever seen Terrible acting dialogue that was unimaginative and pathetic let alone completely inappropriate for supposedly being in the 1800s and oh did I mention a battery pack prominently displayed on the back of one of the characters I was waiting for the boom mike to fall in the middle of a scene And the ending The least I can say is that it was consistent with the rest of the moviecompletely awful And yes it did contain every cliché in the book from the slow walk down the empty dusty road to the laughable lets remember when shots when a main character dies Luckily I saw this on free TV Dont waste your time,negative
Where is it written that sequels must suck Scream 2 didnt Others didnt But this one sure did problems include horrible actors only Christopher Walken could act in the entire film bad writing you will never understand whats going on and I even have done research on the idea of Nephilim before and just horrible choices for casting Eric Roberts makes the stupidest Archangel Michael that I have ever seen in my lifebr br Avoid it like the plague unless you are desperate to see Christopher Walken In that case just fastforward to the parts where he is in the film and avoid the othersbr br Yech,negative
I wouldnt say this totally sucked but if it wasnt for Netflix I wouldnt even have this in my house Steve Martins eccentric president of a chain of health food stores falls flat Hes just not funny Hes another in a LONG slew of SNL rejects that can only find work whoring themselves to the next SNL movie The birthing coach with the Elmer Fudd lisp is about as funny as it is original Amy Poehler simply goes through the same motions she would for a 7 minute SNL skit which is about as funny as SNL lately The only thing going for this movie is that Tina Fey is easy on the eyes The ending was predictable as soon as you heard her character couldnt get pregnant The subject matter could have opened up to other comedic attempts but it seems to simple simmer along not really entertaining or creating laughs,negative
Nightscream is a TV Movie so its bound to be pretty dire especially as its a supposed horror film This young girl is haunted by dreams as she arrives in a small town where there was a murder of a woman one year before She is amazed when everyone in the town thinks she looks exactly like the murdered girl The townsfolk are amazed when she keeps entering dream like trances where she reveals accurate details about the murder and murderer because the police got it all wrong apparently Thinking that they are in danger of being found out the murderers there are two of them start to hatch a plan to get rid of her before she gets to the real truth By this time you will have probably fallen asleep and why do the makers of the film have the mistmaking machine on full throttle in the dream sequences,negative
It is true that some fans of Peter Sellers work may be disappointed with this his last venture But surely any fan of Sellers will find delight in all of his films simply because of the mans huge talent and The Fiendish Plot of Dr Fu Manchu is certainly no exception Unfortunately this would prove to be Sellers last film it was even released after his death but its still nice to see how the man had managed to keep his irreplaceable talent right until his untimely demise And not only do we get one Sellers but we get to for Sellers plays not only the title role but also his nemesis the equally bizarre Nayland Smith the detective on the hunt for the crazed 168 year old Fu The story is equally outlandish as we follow Fus outrageous antics to make his agedefying elixir and also Nayland and his group of associates trying to prevent him Just like any of Sellers greater films the film comes with a guaranteed impeccable performance from him as well as many of his familiarfaced costars  David Tomlinson Sid Caesar John Le Mesurier Clive Dunn and Helen Mirren to name a few Its also nice to see Pink Panther stalwart Burt Kwouk Cato enjoying a cameo with Sellers  albeit playing the same role but still nice The story is indeed pretty ridiculous as are many of the characters involved which classes this as a film strongly under the Goon influence And although it never reaches the heights of Goon comedy there are plenty of amusing jokes that seem to point in the right direction The film failed commercially on its initial release due to the entire world mourning after Sellers death the film was released less than 3 weeks afterand there is always that sorrowful thought lurking in the back of your mind when viewing it that this was Sellers last film Its far from a great film  its often slow too ridiculous and sometimes the jokes simply arent there  but it is nevertheless enjoyable  if only for another top rate performance from Peter Sellers,negative
I came home late one night and turned on the TV to see Siskel and Ebert summarizing their picks of the week I didnt hear anything about Red Rock West except two thumbs up and see it before it went away It wouldnt stay in theaters very long because of the distributors money problems and lack of promotion but they said it deserved betterbr br The next afternoon I followed their advice They were right it was some of the most fun I have ever had at the movies As some readers point out there are a few plot holes and the last 10 minutes dont ever seem to end But its well worth it for the fine craftwork that went into the first hour Its the best role that I have ever seen for Nicholas Cage but almost everybody seems perfectly cast Dennis Hopper goes almost over the top which gets silly but reinforces how well everything else works The sets and the music contribute a great deal to almost every scenebr br When I rented it later for my family it didnt work as well The long scenes that built the tension in the theater were difficult to appreciate with the distractions at home It deserves your full attention turn off the phone make sure you wont be disturbed watch and listen to every scene especially in the beginning,positive

that Jamie Foxx would ever deliver such a wonderful Oscarwinning performance One of the reasons why I was so impressed with Foxxs performance in Ray was because from watching his hammy obnoxious acting in movies like Bait and Booty Call I would never imagine he would ever hold the Oscar If people told me five years ago that Jamie Foxx was one day going to win an Oscar I would laugh right in their faces Who knows Maybe hes better off sticking to drama because if you watch Bait its clearly evident that comedy is not his forte I swear Jamie mugs so much in this movie that Im surprised his face didnt fall off And why does he have to do those stupid voices at every chance he gets Anyone familiar with comedians like Bob Newhart and Steven Wright knows that doing comedy doesnt require being loud and obnoxious If a joke is funny its funny If its not funny then doing some crazy accent is not going to make it any funnier The problem I have with some comedians who decide to try acting is that they favor getting laughs over being in character In real life normal people dont always have witty comebacks and quips Like Albert Brooks said in an interview discussing his character in Taxi Driver its important to be funny as your character rather than be funny as a comedian A prime example of Jamie violating that rule is the nauseatingly awful scene where his mug shots are being taken and he starts posing for the photographs like a model If a regular person were being thrown in jail would he really be acting goofy while having his mug shots taken And wouldnt the police try to scold him if he was There are many scenes like that throughout the film Another awful sequence is one where Jamie is on the unwittingly on the phone with the villain and he starts doing a phony Caribbean accent Not funny Not to mention Jamie never seems to acknowledge the timing of a joke Giving a comedic performance requires patience whereas he goes straight to the punchline whether its the right time for it or not Im not even a big Mike Epps fan but even his performance is good in comparison to Jamies As a matter of fact this is the first time I felt somewhat relieved whenever he would appear on screen Epps has the same flaws when it comes to comedy but at least he chooses a more lowkey approach One of the few bright spots in this clunker of a comedy is David Morse a highly underrated actor mostly known for his supporting roles as villains He seems to be the only actor in the film concerned with grounding it in reality However fellow Green Mile star Doug Hutchison is disgustingly overthetop as the villain A big surprise considering he gave a superb performance in The Green Mile also playing a heavy Antoine Fuqua has proved his directing chops in movies like The Replacement Killers and Training Day Even in Bait he shows he can direct a hell of an action sequence His only problem seemed to be in disciplining Jamie Foxx who probably improvised half the script with one bad joke after another Unless youre a diehard fan of Foxx please dont take the bait,negative
What can I say about Oceans Twelve Who thought that it would ever come to this A gigantic mess that loses itself halfway and cant retrace I found myself amazed at how bad this really was Really I have never seen the ending properly because this film is just insufferable Im a huge fan of the first but this is a lame excuse for a sequel br br What was the point of the heist if they were going to give the money back The movie is just boring and so drag along that I cant ever sit through this It really is bad Just stay as far repeat far away as possible from this movie Its worthless,negative
Robert Siodmak does a fabulous job with this B noir starring Ella Raines Franchot Tone and Alan Curtis And he does it I might add without a lot of help from his male actors ie Curtis and Tone Its Raines all the way a pretty leggy actress who for one reason or another never reached the status of some of her noir counterpartsbr br Siodmaks use of sex light shadows and music is truly remarkable as he tackles this genre The shadows lighting effects and camera angles are all effective But the highlight of the film takes place in a nightclub with a very sexual drum riff by Elisha Cook egged on by an excited Raines Its this scene that brings Phantom Lady into new territorybr br Siodmaks commitment to the material is matched only by Raines who gives a sincere performance as a woman in love trying to save her man Franchot Tone phoned this one in Alan Curtis didnt seem upset that he might die and didnt seem happy that he lived And he never except for a brief moment in prison seemed to be in love with Rainesbr br The amusing thing about many of these films is that as World War II progressed interest in psychiatry deepened But often the terms were used incorrectly in films such as Possessed Spellbound and The Greatest Show on Earth Tone is called paranoid by Thomas Gomez  Tone probably has some paranoia attached to his disorder but he appears to be closer to a psychopath In actuality as evidenced by his headaches he may have had a brain tumor pushing against his brainbr br Phantom Lady doesnt have the greatest plot but its well worth watching,positive
Origins of the Care Bears  their Cousins If you saw the original film youll notice a discrepancy The Cousins are raised with the Care Bears rather than meeting them later However I have no problems with that preferring to treat the films as separate interpretations The babies are adorable and its fun watching them play and grow My favourite is Swift Heart Rabbit The villain is a delightfully menacing shapeshifter I could empathise with the three children since I was never good at sports either Cree Summer is excellent as Christy The songs are sweet and memorable If you have an open heart love the toys or enjoyed the original this is not to be missed 910,positive

This is one of the worst movies I have seen this year You should not see this movie but if you insist on wasting your time you should stop here there are SPOILERS Gray Matters centers on Gray and Sam Baldwin Heather Graham and Tom Cavanagh Only Gray and Sam are Brother and Sister living together in everyone elses eyes as man and wife No sex but just about everything else Early on the movie starts with its theme the most absurd thing at the most absurd moment with you guessed it the most absurd reactions Gray and Sam decided to check out the dog park with a borrowed pooch Rather then push her brother to get the skinny on first woman they see for him she does it and gets to the nittygritty questions too When she signals her brother to come over they start a 3way date Charlie Bridget Moynahan is the girl of THEIR dreams like all the right things etc Sam final hits Gray over the head and the couple finishes the date with a marriage proposal That Charlie accepts In one week Charlie Gray and Sam are to be in Vegas In the next week Charlie and Gray are off shopping for wedding gowns apparently Charlie has an offtherack figure Gray is slurping an iced latte when Charlie suggests Gray tries on some gowns as well and picks out a 10000 frock for her While Charlie is zipping her in this downpaymentonahouse gown Gray continues to slurp on the latte I swear it was like a feed bag What should happen but woops latte all over the gown It is never explained how they got out of Bloomingdales bridal salon with out a 10000 mocha colored gown Back to reality  Caesars palace Las Vegas They have the high roller room Sam is a resident surgeon and Charlie is an intern zoologist  were do they get all this money Gray kicks Sam out to the single room down the hall so she and Charlie can have a bachelorette drinkathon were you guessed it  they kiss Gray remembers everything Charlie remembers nada They make it to wedding chapel and right when the Reverend gets to his line If there is anybody is here who has any objection whatsoever to the union of these two lovebirds Gray gets the hiccups Gray excuses herself for some reason the Reverend must repeat his last line and right on queue again hiccups Gray gets back to NY and starts dating any man she meets literally And of course one is you guessed it again Gay The other is a jerk and the third is a taxi cab driver Alan Cummings named Gordy He is smittened with Gray but the feelings are not returned They become great friends This is good because when she comes clean with Sam about the kiss He blows up and kicks her out of their apartment When Sam comes to his senses he goes to her office Gray works at an ad agency This office is smack in the middle of the twilight zone It has cameras and microphones in all the conference rooms that broadcast to all computer monitors at the agency Sam gets Gray in one of the conference rooms for a notsoprivate conversation and ends up outing her to the entire office This is where I doubt that there was a gay man or lesbian on the crew Gordy comes to her rescue and convinces her to go to a lesbian bar Sorry no men says the bouncer So Gray and Gordy return with Gordy in drag Bad drag He was in a sleeveless black satinlike blouse a string of pearls and a grandmas church hat No lesbian would ever confuse this man in a dress as a drag queen much less a woman The bar was also the straight mans fantasy of what a lesbian bar is full of Victorias Secret models Everything turns out peachy  she goes home with her firms client Gray happens to be on the womans account and finally does more then kiss For some reason no one tells Charlie anything and she is oblivious through the whole movie of this kiss with Gray but that is for the sequel,negative
A series of painfully unfunny skits that seem to go on forever and a day Not as mindnumbingly awful as say Freddy Got Fingered or Lost Reality but that in NO way is an endorsement in ANY way sense or form Features the worst rhyming clown ever Any most if it isnt offensive to anybody but the most prudish or politically correct It also has the worst song parody EVER put on film the WORST Arnold impersonation EVER not just the worst put on film literally the worst EVER I have NO clue why Karen Black Micheal Clarke Duncan or Slash would star in this the reasons I watched this in the first place The only thing mildly amusing was Dickman In conclusion I wouldt recommend this film to ANYONE but the people who are making it their mission in life to get this in the Bottom 250 on this site are pathetic Do something notable with you lives people Plus if its true the Church of Scientalogy hates him he cant be ALL badbr br My Grade D,negative
Danny Lees performance as a wisecracking cop is the only spot of interest in this film even though it has an excellent cast including Chow YunFat Carina Lau Andy Lau Shing FuiOn and Alex Man CYF plays a triad boss who wants to settle down to a life of peace and plenty but Alex Man a total psycho who has a big grudge against CYF wont let him CYF tries to escape to Malacca but to no avail After his family is blown to bits his cronies dead or turncoat wounded and broke CYF returns to Hong Kong to get into some serious revengebr br It sounds a lot better than it is CYF is welldressed and handsome looks pained grimaces and cries on cue but somehow or another you just dont care Andy Lau looks great but thats about it Carina Lau has a tiny tiny little part which was nice but she gets a bullet in the head early on so that ends that Alex Man is a cartoon villain hes so overthetop which at times can be intriguing but the writing here is so flat that he just comes across as a gardenvariety nutbr br Danny Lee is great though  too bad hes only a small blip on the screen of this dark literally and essentially boring moviebr br Rent it dont buy it Or just skip it altogetherbr br This is the sequel to Rich And Famous even though it apparently was filmed simultaneously it was released first because of CYFs boxoffice power,negative
The brilliance of this film lies not in the filmmaking process which is a conventional but executed intertwining tale of the lies of three servicemen post WWII but in the fact that this story was told at all Samuel Goldwyn deserves credit for having the chutzpah to push through a film who has for its leads a disabled vet with pincers for hands an alcoholic and an underachiever,positive
My first attempt at watching this ended in 8 minutes roughly after the TV report scene which I couldnt handle It went approximately like thisbr br Reporter 1 Hmm theres a pyramid in our skies Reporter 2 I think its aliens awkward silence Reporter 1 In other newsbr br A few days later I watched it to the end and it wasnt as horrible as Ive imagined but there are serious problems with this About half of the plot can be easily discarded And the other half should be expanded to explain the background story or somethingbr br What use are the detective the eugenics people and the monsters which are disposed of momentarily by Horus More amusing was the monopoly scene Were all powerful Gods who have lived for aeons and of all the games in the multiverse we happen to play monopoly Monopoly Monopoly Even Erich von Dainiken looks coherent compared to thatbr br The other half is terribly lacking What did our protagonist do to get himself cryofrozen Why was there no big event when he was released at the end He had those pesky followers remember What happened to normal humans Whats the deal with the masked guy How did the bluehaired girl appear Whats with her eyesight Etcetera etceterabr br Visually its OK more or less if you disregard the Egyptian Gods looking like walking turds with rotweiller heads,negative
I saw the film for the first time at BBC on July the 27 of 2005 For me it was a good interpretation of the person Conan Doyleand I truly wonder what the sherlock fans think about it I also think it is a movie for these fans whether they agree or not what is mentionedYou may ask yourself was AC Doyle a strong person or did he put himself in question However he was the creator of the famous Holmesbut how much of it was a sort of semibiography Not the less I strongly put this adaption forward it is a movie you have to see  even if you arent interested in the Sherlock Holmes movies or books  look a it  enjoy yourself and have your own opinion of it,positive
I loved this movie 10 years ago when I was about 16 years old My biggest mistake was to watch it again 10 years later Its not the worst Iwannabeapilot movies ever but it has so many flaws in it that you can hardly overlook thembr br Queens One Vision along with the rest of the soundtrack makes this film better than the average patriotic nonsense you usually get to see br br ,negative
I do not see what is the whole deal about this movie Patricia Kaas sings yes and that makes the film charming but singing is not enough I mean if you want to get all benefits of this one go buy Patricias CD and enjoy The plot is simple if to omit the dreams the main characters seem to love each other instantly and as well instantly forget their other acquaintances Relationships appear almost mandatory and the little detective story thrown in just makes things worse What at first appeared to be a perfect movie ending is first screwed up and then comes out as just a dream I measure movies by how well I would remember them and for this one I already started to forget the details,negative
Why do people need to follow the opinion of the herds of masses and critics RANDOM HEARTS directed by the brilliant Sydney Pollack who has a small role in the film too is another Harrison Ford vehicle As such it is quite good and entertaining Surely anyone who goes to see it has this in mind or read the book which is no better Even Kristin Scott Thomas fans myself included knew it would be a variation of her again playing the love interest of her eldest uncle Even as such the film is satisfying Whats so bad about this movie that is much better in the other much higher rated Harrison Ford vehicles This film is no masterpiece but its not as bad as the masses would have the potential viewer believe,positive
Countenance Antoine Monot in a copycat impersonation of Kevin Smiths Silent Bob keeps asking for it but writerdirector Christian Zübert never listens Zübert just cant say no to a joke no matter how cheap The best thing about this movie is its soundtrack Of course Joey Burns of Calexico and the divine Jonathan Richman understated oldschool bard of Theres something about Mary fame would grace any smalltown dropout story In visual allure Stefan Lukas Gregorowicz looks cool enough riding his tan sixseries BMW twodoor wearing aviator shades going nowhere True he accidentally sleeps with his wildeyed bohemian kid sister Marie Zielcke but then who wouldnt Thumbs up also to how he goes blackandwhite on a liberal dose of that mysterious substance they call zerozero but if youre looking for a slightly more serious rendering of what intoxication can do to you I suggest you check out Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas,negative
What a terrible TERRIBLE film One of the worst movies I have seen in my life I usually love movies like this the whole A guy meets an eccentric woman who he likes but he happens to already be involved with someone who not right for him I expected something predictable and I didnt mind The movies are always entertaining mixing the right amount of romance with comedy but not this one Every single joke falls flat and the romance makes me want to vomit The title character is one of the most please kill me characters that I have ever witnessed on my television the eccentric woman isnt very eccentric more like quirky and annoying The other someone is the most reasonable mature person in this film but also happens to be just as annoying This films flat out sucks theres no way around it dont waste your time,negative
This movie was highly entertaining The soundtrack Bian Adams is simply beautiful and inspiring Even more impressive is Brian Adams doing all the songs in French as well The score is also uplifting and dramaticbr br The movie is made from a mix of traditional animation combined with computer generated images The result is truly stunning I watch this film at least once a week with my kids and we never tire of it The story is compelling and well narratedbr br I dont understand anyone who would rank this movie less than a 7 Definately a keeper in my household,positive
Back in the days before the Toxic Avenger the lowcamp kings at Troma Films tried to take the high OK somewhatlesslow road of producing straight slasher pics Id like to think that viewing the results here is what convinced them to give up all pretension and go for selfconscious parodybr br Splatter University is another film for the masochists in the audience As it meanders about through two separate casts and innumerable pointless subplots it actually becomes painful to watch Lets see if I can summarizebr br After learning that a dangerous psychopath has escaped from a local hospital the action moves to a Catholic university I dont recall the name but in honor of the title lets call it St Splatter The students are listless and sullen and argue pettily with each other slackers ahead of their time Meanwhile the new professor Julie Parker proves utterly incompetent at her job The kids deal with relationships infidelity unwanted pregnancies lecherous priests and how to avoid doing any work in class Julie deals with a creepy boyfriend the inflexible administration at St Splatter counseling unwed mothers and the blank expressionless looks of her students None of it means a darn thing or gets resolved in any meaningful way Oh and every once in a while a POV shot comes along and stabs one of the girls to death but dont hold your breath waiting for it Theres a Red Herring Killer and then a sadly anticlimactic confrontation with the Real Killer then its back to the asylum and roll creditsbr br The slow pace and numerous inane subplots seem almost calculated to produce a mounting sense of frustration in the viewer which is helped along by choppy editing coffeecan sound quality and dialog that just doesnt make any sense And the most agonizing thing about this movie is the killers fixation on women  the men in this movie are just so deserving Idve paid good money to see someone off the jerk with the pregnant girlfriend or the lunkhead Lothario who was fooling around with his girlfriends roommate or any of the creepy priests There aint no justice,negative
I think I usually approach film festival comedies with the low expectation that they will invariably be quirky and that any intended humor will be derived solely at the expense of the characters simplicity in the face of a complicated context What was exceptional about Big Bad Swim was that the director was able to maintain the integrity and development of his characters in his film while still finding laughoutloud humor in scene after scene There was a sophistication maybe due also in part to the sharp work of the DP Ive rarely seen in an indie film and even more rarely in a comedy Of special note here Paget Brewsters turn as Amy the math teacher After seeing this performance I cannot understand why Brewster hasnt been discovered by a larger audience She brings the necessary mix of anger and likability to the role that really helps this picture reach its potential This is a terrific work deserving of a larger audience I look forward to more from the director and this cast,positive

They are hunted and starving They are completely demoralized and yet they press on through sheer inertia This film tries to answer the question How far will human beings go to survive Hopelessness emanates from every of this film and like so many japanese films of this time it condemns the blind military loyalty that pressed the japanese people into war,positive
I must say I was really excited about this film before renting it as it was an Adam Sandler Happy Madison production and I am usually attracted to that type of silly humourbr br There were a few funny moments at the beginning of the film but this film lacked everything that makes a good movie I realize that many filmsthat are not realistic can still be quite funny but this film was unrealistic and not funny at all The acting was horrible the cinematography was very poor the plot made no sense at all I cannot get over the fact that 3 classy older ladies would even work for such poor writing Overall I was very unimpressed with this film and I do not recommend wasting 5 bucks on renting it,negative

before seeing this film the 1998 version was my only experience of this dickens story i didnt enjoy that film very much but this 1974 adaptation moves on in a particulary tiresome fashionbr br the actors dont shine the main couple michael york and sarah miles are especially wooden cases the only character of real interest for me was anthony quayles intelligent jaggersbr br the so called plot is ridiculous but the story itself is a great one its a real lesson on how your distorted values and obsessive principles can destroy you live with an open mind and dont care what other people say you are what you are if others cant take it  em pip was told this early on but he didnt listenbr br the girl adopted by the weird old lady reminded me a little of the old kaspar hauser story not in that same horrible level but in the way she molded the child to create the executor of her personal vendetta against the entire opposite sex she thought had deceived her pips childhood didnt appear much better the ending didnt seem to fit the rest of the storys style the sets looked cheap and coming to imdb im not surprised to see that this was indeed a tvmovie which i had no idea of when i borrowed it from the librarybr br live and learn so many good movies so little time thats why the reviews are here so YOU wouldnt have to waste your time on this sort of moviesbr br 310,negative
Why did I go to see this film Honestly because Jim Carrey was in it and in the past he has made hilarious movies that have made me cry with laughter so do you really blame me for expecting that again Additionally the premise the funny trailer his costar Jennifer Anistons involvement and the fact it was a massive hit stateside encouraged mebr br However as my one line Summary suggests I was Disappointed For various reasonsbr br Reason 1 It wasnt funny In a 2hour movie I laughed for about 510minutesall together the rest of the time I sat thinking I really should have got some icecream I admit that maybe it is wrong to judge Jim Carrey on his previous films but what does he really expect when he makes Gems such as The Truman Show  Liar Liar  Me Myself and Irene  Dumb and Dumber  The Mask and the Ace Ventura films then produces in Bruce Nolans own words such a mediocre filmbr br Reason 2 Jennifer Anistons role was criminally underwritten I mean hello Shes been around in the public eye for about ten years now and in this film she gets about four lines to say Wrongbr br Reason 3 One word  Clichébr br Reason 4 A casual deployment of specifically American References  Jimmy Hoffa Walter Cronkite sweeps week  is a clue to the films specifically homegrown appeal A teenager says no to drugs and yes to an Education  thats a miracle Want to see a miracle soon Be the miracle God tells Bruce a heavy handed sentiment that seems to have gone down a treat in the US but might face tougher resistance in markets that retain an inkling for subtlety Additionally I still go to school and that statement suggests me and all of my friends are miraclesor maybe it just means we have brainsbr br In this film there are enough funny Carrey moments to make you chuckle and prevent Bruce Almighty from being a total calamity but you are advised to start revising your expectations downwards,negative

Bela made 9 pics for Monogram but it was only at THIS one the 4TH that things started to come together All the rest in the series would use this one as the essential template for production writing and character development From here on better or worse the series would also deal with one essential theme a scientist usually Bela makes experiments in the basement or the old house sometimes IN the basement in the old house that causes things to go blooey This was also the first time that Art Director Dave Milton got a chance to spread his wings He came on board for BLACK DRAGONS the flick before but THIS one is where he gets to make his craft start to click Lewis made great atmosphere for next to nothing and was around for all the rest of the Monograms Casting is key in these and its a pretty good one B movie wise here You get Barclay and Harlen also from BLACK DRAGONSalong with Russell who would star in Lewtons CAT PEOPLE moviesand Rosetto from SPOOKS RUN WILDa nice slice of Poverty Row talent If you have limited time and budget start with this oneit sums up everything they had learned up to this point and gives you something to compare the rest to The plot Bela steals gland juice to keep his nasty wife young They both like to sleep in coffins If you can read that and smile the rest will be easy,positive

This was one of the best halfhour horrorsuspensefantasy shows of the eighties without a doubt Granted the show had a barely capable cast with every single episode and it stank as far as production values ie the sets went but darn it I have to give it some credit for being gutsy with the plots I mean the plot of each episode was edgy enough that even I a hardened horror movie shockfilm and 70s grindhouse buff got a little sickened and creeped out Great show just great regardless of what the other reviewers have said here My favorite episode was called Bug House yeah that was the title I think Anyhow it still gives me the willies every time I think about it to this day almost 20 years after it first premiered Other shows like Tales From The Darkside The Outer Limits and of course The Twilight Zone were definitely better production valueswise but in my opinion they aint got a thing as far as plot lines go when compared to this sick little show It definitely paved the way for the even more graphic cult classic phenomenon that was Tales From The Crypt,positive

Possible spoilersbr br Although there was some good acting  particularly Chloe Sevigny and Radha Mitchell in the comedy half  this simply was not an engaging film The segues between the comedy part and the tragedy part were awkward or sometimes not obvious This viewer was initially confused by the fact that the supporting cast differs in the two halves I thought with the way things were laid out in the opening scene that the people surrounding Melinda would be the same people just reacting differently more of a He Said She Said premise However what we have is two totally different stories and two totally different women both of whom happen to be played by Radha Mitchellbr br The two playwrights in the opening scene  the comedian and the tragedian  supposedly take the same premise and go from there but the two stories are only tenuously related They do little to support the topic of discussion which is that almost anything can be looked at as either comedy or tragedy Nice cast but a disappointing film,negative
An unmarried woman named Stella Bette Midler gets pregnant by a wealthy man Stephen Collins He offers to marry her out of a sense of obligation but she turns him down flat and decides to raise the kid on her own Things go OK until the child named Jenny Trini Alvarado becomes a teenager and things gradually and predictably become worsebr br Ive seen both the silent version and sound version of Stella Dallas Neither one affected me much and I cry easily but they were wellmade if dated Trying to remake this in 1990 was just a stupid idea I guess Midler had enough power after the incomprehensible success of Beaches to get this made This predictably bombed The story is laughable and dated by todays standards Even though Midler and Alvarado give good performances this film really drags and I was bored silly by the end Stephen Collins and Marsha Mason both good actors dont help in supporting roles Flimsy and dull Reallywho thought this would work See the 1937 Stanwyck version instead I give this a 1,negative
Perhaps I missed something but I found GOYAS GHOSTS to be a tedious costume melodrama As to the story it was trying to tell I found that a confusing mishmash that went off in all directions And perhaps it should have been made by a Spanish director with the appropriate languages subtitled rather than in unconvincingly accented English I cant judge the historical veracity of the story but it seemed to move along with a similar artists models tragic fate plot line as GIRL WITH A PEARL EARRING Was the movie a commentary on the religious injustices of the Inquisition false piety torture then and now or what I never seemed to be able to figure that one out Natalie Portmans various characters also seemed ridiculously stereotypical And ultimately the movie was crowned with the concluding melodrama of a disheveled Bardems head and body hanging on the edge of cart heading off into the sunsetwith Ines and Goya following along behindCant Milos Forman do better than that,negative
If I hadnt read his name on the DVD cover I never would have suspected that this rather gushy and old fashioned musical was made by a man so closely associated with the French New Wave In fact the film is so far from that that I wonder if back in the 50s and 60s New Wave auteurs would have absolutely hated this type of filmits sosounreal And it seems to have little to do with so many of his previous films This isnt necessarily a bad thingjust a very surprising thingbr br What I also found a bit surprising was the amount of praise some of the reviewers gave this filmespecially when there are so many better French musicals out there The songs in this film were simply not particularly interesting and the characters all seemed so bland and stereotypical If I had to see another rich person who fretted about how hard it is to be rich or get a good sale price on a designer outfit I was going to pukebr br The bottom line is that like American musicals not every French musical is gold This film is not another Les parapluies de Cherbourg UMBRELLAS OF CHERBOURG or Huit Femmes EIGHT WOMEN and despite the presence of Audrey Tautou I cant see much reason to recommend it as anything other than a dull oddity,negative
I saw this film at the Chicago Reeling film festival To pick up on the previous reviewers remarks the claustrophobic feel and off colors of the film is I sense quite intentional and conveys the sense of limited space drab architecture overall drabness that constitutes the urban environment of most people in Eastern and Central Europe A bit shabby housing project style is how Id describe it and this is how many people live on the outskirts of larger cities I cant say that Im familiar with Bucharest Romania where the action unfolded but I have visited and lived in Eastern Europe for six months br br When I visited Russia as a student for a semester my entire group had to drag their luggage seven stories up the staircase of a shabby student dorm building just as the heroine does when moving in with a woman because the elevators werent working But I do concur with the reviewer that the claustrophobia and muted colors its overdone for there are to be sure beautiful historic buildings parks squares you can find in Bucharest or in any historic city center of Eastern Europe and Bucharests didnt get much of any footage in this film For me watching this film conveys well the claustrophobia that I would feel during my halfyear stay there feeling trapped and limited It makes you see why someone would want to immigrate and find a better life just as people if hope to escape from a United States urban ghetto br br Also given the climate of homophobia say circa US in the 1980s the two young women who fall in love with one another are forced to keep their love a very private matter hence the focus on their interaction in the apartmentbr br Its remarkable and commendable in my view that this queer themed film was even made in Romania and I find the complaint of the previous reviewer about the poor film quality quite uninformed and patronizing Its unlikely that the director and producer drummed up much government support and funding for their film and they did the best they could with their likely limited resources The actors were fairly good and believable the dialog was overall well done and I could identity with these womenbr br The film offers an added twist to that of forbidden love between two young women Kiki an energetic funloving free spirit with a dark troubling secret her admiration and love for an abusive incestuous brother Sandu falls in love with Alexandra a bright bookish idealistic young woman who moves to Bucharest to begin her college studies Opposites attract and their personalities seem to complement one another though there is some tension between the ambitious studious intellectual Alexandra and Kiki who seems to be attending college to please her parents Keeping their love hidden from their parents seems manageable though we dont get any sense of the tension it requires nor do we ever see or meet any other studentshard to believeand the tension keeping their love secret would have entailed The chief threat to their love is Kikis brother and her difficulty in trying to severe her relation to him But Kikis love for Alexandra seems to give her the strength she needs to finally severe this bond or does it Thats what the suspense of the film focuses on as the narrative develops and I wont say how it concludesbr br Ironically Kikis love sickness isnt love for another woman but her illicit incestuous love for her brother Thus loving a woman offers the potential cure to the sickness of loving a sibling br br Though this feel of this film is stifling and claustrophobic overly confined to interactions between Kiki and Alexandra it was still engaging and moving to watch so Ill give it a 7,positive

Good to see Im not the only person who remembers this great film I have very fond memories of this movie  seem to vaguely remember back to when I was about 8 and Id watch the kids TV shows after school Broom Cupboard anyone This was the first and last film to scare me  and the images of the boy surrounded by mist on a hill will stay with me forever Like most films of this era it has a happy ending  aimed at children but with a definite ability to capture an adults attention The lovely Cornish scenery really sets the film up to feel isolated  and the ghostly scenes are simple but very very effective Id love to try and find this movie again  see if it still hits home,positive
I suggest that in the future any movie made by the Sci fi channel and subsequently released on DVD must say that it was indeed made by such channel as I would not buy this stuff if I had known this fact Not that this was all bad but when you have fade out for commercials in the middle of your movie it just ruins the flow of said film This in turn makes the movie rather more boring This one had an interesting story however the light hearted and extremely generic soundtrack distracted one from the film as did most of the bad actors with the exception of Dien and Linda Carter The story vampires are on the attack in South America of course the rules of vampire movies are not in effect which the usually arent in any of the movies about vampires I have seen lately with the exception of the Blade trilogy Group of soldiers are sent down to battle said squad another team is sent to meet up with the team and to track down the ex wife of one of the soldierswhy she is not just his wife who knows as this part of the plot really goes no where Still we get an interesting boat ride some nice jungle scenery and a lot of blood This fact however does not save the film from being way to jerky in its presentation and really dull seeming at times I dont know maybe it was the cgi blood and smoke and whatever they have to make cgi now even though old effects look better and dont cost that much more I mean cheap Italian zombie movies could do a bullet hole without cgi why cant we now,negative
This is a short crudely animated series by David Lynch as it says in the beginning and it follows the misadventures of a backwoods overallwearing large man with a wife who has a stress disorder and an annoying son Both of those elements are harped upon repeatedly in the short episodes and theres no real plot to be seen Its easier if you think of this as an exceptionally odd slightly macabre Looney Tunes with far more gore profanity bloody violence and occasional moments of hilaritybr br I bought the DVD along with Eraserhead having previously seen Eraserhead Dont look to this series if you want an artistic masterpiece this is anything but In fact it seems to almost be a statement against such things as its rough style spits in the face of any sort of animation convention you may see As Lynch says If this is funny it is only funny because we see the absurdity of it all,positive
Illtempered verbally abusive movie studio chief runs his male assistant ragged with nitpicking requests keeping the young man firmly under his thumb with constant threats of unemployment after a year of officeterror the working stiff finally cracks Writerdirector George Huang has possibly bit off more than he can chew here His Swimming With Sharks isnt a diatribe against Hollywood nor is it a tribute to the hardworking underlinginstead its stunt filmmaking with a twist a onetrick pony with tunnelvision The surroundings dont look or feel like Tinsel Town perhaps due to a limited budget and we never get a sense of this stressful environment as a moviemaking entity it could be a realtors office in the Valley for all we know Lead Kevin Spacey who also served as one of the films producers gives a controlled and focused performance as the powermad mogul whose ego is out of control he does good work and yet the character doesnt ring true We learn so little about him and his acquaintances that his important position and highranking status fail to jibe with what we do see who does this man answer to what drives him beyond humiliating others for sport what projects is he juggling aside from the one script we see passed around The film is so emotionally stunted and underpopulated it begins to seem like a stageplay padded out for the big screenand yet one without enough characters or motivations in it Perhaps Huang wanted to keep things simple but instead his movie looks like a halfbaked project which needed a lot more insight humor and atmosphere  from ,negative
Are we really making video nasties again In the guise of a digital wide screen big budget remake of 8MM this is quite a ride Unfortunately there is a bit too much story and at times this becomes like a travelogue as our heroine searches the sleaze spots of Paris Hamburg and Amsterdam I am however being rather churlish for the depraved scenes including everything from hot wax harsh whipping and rough sex to drowning beheading and some These scenes are immaculate and its a pity Bruno and his budget couldnt stretch to make all the many characterful creatures introduced become more than simply caricatures,positive
Brilliant overacting by Lesley Ann Warren Best dramatic hobo lady I have ever seen and love scenes in clothes warehouse are second to none The corn on face is a classic as good as anything in Blazing Saddles The take on lawyers is also superb After being accused of being a turncoat selling out his boss and being dishonest the lawyer of Pepto Bolt shrugs indifferently Im a lawyer he says Three funny words Jeffrey Tambor a favorite from the later Larry Sanders show is fantastic here too as a mad millionaire who wants to crush the ghetto His character is more malevolent than usual The hospital scene and the scene where the homeless invade a demolition site are alltime classics Look for the legs scene and the two big diggers fighting one bleeds This movie gets better each time I see it which is quite often,positive
Clive Barker of Hellraiser fame has written and produced a fantasy horror film that is funny and excitingbr br The makeup done by Bob Keen and Geoffrey Portass was fantastic It took quite an imagination to come up with these mutants that lived underground It was really a treat to see the quality of workbr br It wasnt particularly horrible as the worst creature was actually a human serial killerbr br I just saw Craig Sheffer in Shadow of Doubt the other day and he did a good job in this film also Nothing spectacular but fair This was only Anne Bobbys third film and she was good alsobr br The ending was spectacular and the rednecks got their just desserts as did David Cronenberg Ha,positive

I couldnt believe this terrible movie was actually made at all With the worst actors you could find the worst script written Mark Frost  Sollace Mitchell and by far the worst waste of time in viewing I wont belabor the story as its really not worth it But I will elaborate on some of the performances and definitely the story As to the story it is very hard to believe that this bitty crazy schemer could actually do what she did That in reality the wife couldnt defend herself against a little bitty of a thing That the husband could actually find the nut case attractive at all That the defense attorney could break every court rule there was and keep on doing it after the judge ordered the blankety blank to shut up And the final result of the film is an insult to justice movie codes and the male species The theme of this mess is let women do as they wish kill whom they want defend the killer and get away with it while the guy rots in jail the innocent victim Hard to believe that Sollace Mitchell the director and a man would even want to make this dribblebr br As to the acting Jordan Ladd the killer is awful A loony toons who does needlepoint during her murder trial is this allowed in court She bored me to the hilt One more look of her batting her eyes and indicating how innocent she was and Id throw up Shes not even attractive enough for any guy to leave his wife The husband played on one level by Vincent Spano just seems to look and act stupid most of the time He was so predictable in his performance falling into the traps set for him by all the women surrounding him The worst by far was Holland Taylor as the Defense Attourney She over acted throughout the film and made a mockery of justice If she would cross examine me anytime Id have told her to go take a hike Everybody else in this sleazy film did their job as directed to do sobr br I wish I could give this film a zero rating However we are forced to start with 1 Too bad Lets not have anymore painful watching films like this Lifetime can do better then this I know itbr br This is a postscript Made the mistake of turning this insipid movie on by mistake As soon as I saw the bimbo Jordan Ladd I knew Id seen it before and didnt like it or her I not only turned the darn thing off but had to add my anger at people like Sollace Mitchell who wrote the screenplay but also directed this horrible flick Doesent anyone see that herhis message is that sickness pays Being ill and going around killing people is okay with this directorwriter Totally making the male species idiots Well this male tells you to go stuff it somewhere painful Were not all that stupid and will speak out to your so called movie which in this persons mind deserves to be trashedbr br And again this loser is shown Why Cant you read the comments on this stupid and despicable movie Are we constantly subjected to see the bimbo Jordan Ladd again and again Get her off TV films and out of sight Shes just terrible in every sense of the word Phew,negative
This movie is the second worst film that I have ever seen the first being Ghost Rider There is absolutely no plot climax conflict or any other major detail required in portraying a story This film is basically just another excuse for Toby Keith to show off his manly side and the tough guy he really is I completely wasted my time watching this film The best part would have to be the ending credits If I were Ebert or Roper I would have cut my thumbs off and thrown them at the producers Whoever in their right mind gave Toby Keith the chance to act in a feature film is obviously on the same mental level as him In conclusion do not waste your time watching this movie it could quite possibly be the only thing you regret,negative
Fata Morgana is by far one of the weirdest and most perplexing art films I have ever seen I hesitate to call it a documentary because while is does have elements of documentation of its images the images themselves are so unusual so hallucinogenic so unclear that I wonder whether it was really worth telling this story just so that these images can exist The film basically is the tale of the earth and the creation of the earth shot from the perspective of an outsider be it alien or something otherwise indescribable all taking place in the Sahara desert The title of the picture relates to the illusion or reflection of images both real and hallucinated that people in the desert often witness These are also known as miragesbr br The film opens with a plane landing followed by the plane landing again and then again and again and again and again and again and again With each plane landing shot the actual architecture of both the location it is landing at and the plane itself begin to slowly dissolve into one another and grow less and less real and more and more reflective imagery The imagery in this film only grows more intense and more unusual as the picture continues The narration of the film tells of the creation of the universe as alarming sexual images of sand and landscape move past the camera The shots go further and further into the desert and Herzog films whatever he sees and finds The strangest reflections of the world are on display in the distance while Herzog meets some of the most pure and photogenic collections of outsiders that you are ever likely to see When the Leonard Cohen soundtrack kicks in you can be sure that you are in the world of a mad man who is in love with the universebr br I cannot say too much more about this film without ruining anything but I will say that it is a sobering experience and theres really nothing like it I love seeing films that are just in classes of their own This film certainly is a good example of how Herzog loves to intermingle narrative storytelling and documentary filmmaking into an interchangeable form Fata Morgana unfortunately does overstay its welcome just a bit but by the time it nears its end the images will most likely be burned into your mind forever Definitely a mustsee for those who are obsessed with the nature and the origin of the universe,positive
I havent yet read the Kurt Vonnegut book this was adapted from but I am familiar with some of his other work and was interested to see how it would be translated to the screen Overall I think this is a very successful adaptation of one of Vonneguts novels It concerns the story of an American living in Germany who is recruited as a spy for the US His job is to ingratiate himself with high ranked Nazis and send secret messages to the Americans via his weekly radio show But when the war ends he is denounced as a war criminal but escapes to New York where various odd plot twists awaitbr br If Mother Night has a problem its that it tends to get a little too sentimental at times But for most of the film the schmaltz is kept to a minimum and the very strange plot is carried through with skill and aplomb And there are some fabulous moments of black comedy involving three right wing Christian fundamentalists and a very highly ranked Nazi in a prison cell Very much recommended,positive
This is the kind of movie i fear the most Arrogant and Irresponsible it presents a sketch of the colombian conflict so cliched and dumb it represents an insult to all Colombian people The performances are godawul from Grisales her naked scene is absolutely pitiful to Bejarano to Fanny Mickey who looks right out of a Tim Burton nightmare to Díaz who makes a notable effort to bring life to a character so onedimensional so cliched and so badly written all hes left to work with is a mustache Not to mention the gratuitous ending a gore fest so cheesy that it would make Ed Wood cringe It fails in all ways cinematography art direction costumes makeup editing and most of all directing Jorge Alí Triana has always been a lousy filmmaker but at least his previous movies had some dignity I cant say anything good about this waste of money except that i hope Colombian filmmakers learn a lesson about honesty integrity and responsability from this meanintended fiasco,negative
The 1977 animatedlive action hybrid version of Gullivers Travels or rather Travel since he only gets as far as Lilliput didnt get much of a release and its not too difficult to see why Michel Legrand comes up with some catchy tunes but they merely inspire lyricist Don Black to the likes of One simple fact remainsNoone here suffers from growing pains Richard Harris once again overindulges in his passion for excessive makeup toning down the eyeliner for far too much foundation this time in an effort to hide the fact hes at least 25 years too old for the role but at least he perhaps inappropriately reduces his largerthanlife tendencies for a performance made up mainly of patronising whispering The Belgian animation looks only slightly better than early morning French childrens TV but Peter Hunts film is not nearly as bad as it sounds  the use of real model sets for the animated characters harks back to Max and Dave Fleischers 1939 version while a couple of moments of Swiftian satire do remain  although its definitely aimed at the youngest of children,negative
I just took my 11 year old daughter and 8 year old son to this movie and I cant remember a movie where I laughed SO hard  literal out loud deep bursts of laughter because this movie is hilarious Granted the story line is predictable but the ride is so extremely enjoyable it doesnt matter that you know how its going to end The actors comedic senses of timing were impeccable The actors were perfectly cast My children mentioned that Amanda Bynes seems to be the last of the young women actresses who arent ruining their lives She is so refreshing My children said this is now their favorite movie of 2006 Our money was well spent on this movie,positive
These are the kinds of movies I loved and still love growing up Unlike big budget movies that crate huge plot holes and never acknowledge them This movie takes in all in stride and just makes something you can sit back and enjoybr br There was some film student earlier that complained it wasnt A list material But that is not the point The point of this movie is that no everyone likes huge CGI Cliché filled movies There are a lot of people who like movies that are meant to just entertain you and not get as much money as they canbr br Besides its also nice to know that good ol Bruce isnt dead yet,positive
The year 2000 had been a bad year for indian films due to lack of quality and imagination from film directors Other than Mohabbatein and Kaho Naa Pyaar Hai nothing stood out CCCC had lot of contraversy due to the financing of the film and this with not really knowing what the film is about has generated good publicity and advanced ticket sales for the film around India and Abroad The only information given was that it was a suspense thriller The film is now been released in 2001 and the film was surprisingly quite good The main plot is to do with surrogacy and is well handled Salman And Preiti give a good performance where Salman doesnt actually take is shirt off at allmust be special effects Rani plays Salmans wife but it is slightly a less demanding role compared with Preiti who plays Prostitute who eventually becomes the surrogate mother The three main leads confirm after Har Di Jo Pyar Karega they have a solid on screen and off screen chemistryapparently Salman Khan who is excellent plays a serious role in the film as a successful business man and is a pity is being exploited as a wannabe comedian in his other films as he is quite underrated in the Mumbai film industry partly due to the films he chooses Ranis Character does not know Preiti is a prostitute until the endthis kept from her and the rest of the familythe rest you should find out as it will ruin the film if i told you The songs are all picturised well especially dekhne walon and the main title song The other supporting actors do a minimal but fine effort as Salmans loving family Abbas Mastan has produced a hit and handled the film subject tactfullyI say go and watch it or rent it whatever you prefer,positive

Let me first start out by saying 1 out of 10 is too good for this movie Its unfortunate that IMDb doesnt have tenths of a star I watched this abortion of a movie in the middle of the night due to insomnia and it was absolute garbage The plot was horrible The acting was horrible The movie was utterly boring malachi looked like the Shadow with Alec Baldwin The Shadow is infinitely better than this as well The character Eve was so undeveloped and 2 dimensional she didnt even grab my attention I didnt even know her name was Eve Don was interesting when he kept his mouth shut The TWIST if you can call it that was laughable and pathetic When it came the movie had done such a horrid job of building suspense or attachment to any character that I simply thought Who gives a S The only thing that made me even lift an eyebrow about this movie was the fact the med teacher was Dyson in Terminator 2 Also a movie that was light years ahead of this motion picture massacre Anyone who was involved in this movie should be ashamed of themselves for wasting 90 minutes of countless peoples time Its no wonder no actor from this movie ever had a fruitful career In summary This movie is so bad I feel dirty and need a shower Worst movie in history Gigli was better Prom Night the remake was better and dare I say it Saw IV was better,negative

I was very excited to see a documentary on one of my favorite Italian directors DAmato has dabbled in everything from Horror postapocalyptic to hardcore Porn He has touched upon genius a couple of times with films like Buio Omega and Emmanuelle  The Last Cannibals This documentary is a lenghty and informative guide to the films of DAmato He is interviewed throughout with English subtitles rolling across the bottom of the screen The excerpts from his films are narrated by a narrator with english subtitles The documentary proved extra interesting when it analyzed the often censored Emmanuelle In America Here Damato explaines the faked snuff scenes in detail and recalls some funny stories In fact good ol Joe is very warm and funny throughout always wearing a smile and smoking a cigarette The one disapointing aspect of this documentary is that it spends little time on Damatos Horror films like Anthropophagus and the brilliant Buio Omega It spends too much time on the erotic cinema and hardly touches the postapocaplyptic films But I cant complain It is wonderful to see Damato get the respect he deserves Highly recommended for fans of Damato May he rest in peace,positive

Released as KING BOXER in the UKbr br This film was essentially the FIRST kung fu film to go on general release in the UK Many of us had ratcheted through Kurosawas astonishingly gritty and involving dramas and were used to oriental film being beautifully shot and lit with somewhat restrained pacing all in all like leafing through an album of very fine still photographs that just happened to be movingbr br Along come Run Run Shaw and co with their widescreen home movie production values and astonishing ripeforparody dubbing and all the rules have changed KIng Boxer was the first in through the door leaving a clearly marked trail for others to follow with their feet planted firmly on top of the blazed footstepsbr br In spite of hokey plots pantomime acting cheesy jumpcuts and spaghetti western style snapstepped zooms this film was marvellous Gorgeous without being opulent and with the most brilliant fight choreography ever to grace a screen We loved the sickening violence the anguish the testosterone The martial artists among us found some of the techniques fascinating if flamboyant and oftentimes silly It was so very different from the Japanese stuff we all knew and it had lovely acrobatic grace that perfectly complemented the sickening violence and bloodstained floors Delightfulbr br The KIng Lear scene was at the time quite a milestone in schlock You cruel bastards My   Now its rather less shocking but still a bit of a gutchurnerbr br We didnt notice that any females in sight were absolutely onedimensional After seeing more films of the genre it now stands out like a sore thumb but at the time it didnt matterbr br This film defined what would rapidly become the kungfu movie clichés All of them Watch it and remember that until this burst onto the western screens there was no genre for it to slot into It was unique and awesome It was the first kung fu movie and it still is for me and many others the best,positive
I must say that I was disapointed with this film I have never been a huge BNL fans I find their songs kind of childish and obsessively nostalgic this is me in grade 9 if i had a million dollars shoe box of life etc However I have seen clips of their live show and I really like the improvisational and goofy nature of the show I was hoping that this movie would highlight this which is unfortunately the most interesting part of the show because their music is well played yet somehow bland and not that compelling there is a standup bass solo in the middle which was completely pointless and boring despite how much Jim Creegan was digging himself The film does not and shows only a few minutes of it and you know theyve had better moments as in the Afgahnistan concert Koffee Anan hes the man in charge my names Steve Paige and Im really large br br BNL are kind of like when I went to Europe a few years ago and heard that godawfull Blue song by Effeil 99 or whatever every 2 minutes I came back to Canada and then a month later that song was all over the place again I nearly chewed off my own arm BNL is like that years ago I remember many a fond memory of sitting around campfires in Canada listening to people play If I had a million dollars BNL was a cult phenomenon in Canada and much of their humour has a particular Canadian slant to it Kraft Dinner is a staple for many students up here and the name Gordon is quintessentially Canadian a few years went by where they slipped into obscurity and I was somewhat gratefull Then all of a sudden they become huge in States and everyone down there thinks they are this brand new band yeah theyre brand new but theyre all in their 30s while the rest of Canada is going Oh geez I thought those guys folded years ago do I have to listen to million dollars againbr br The concert footage is not bad but I would have liked to have seen more of their stage routine the shooting is not that great and things like clips from their massive free show in Boston are glazed over much too quickly The interviews are surprisingly dull for such a funny bunch of guys I think theyre all old and they have families and houses and stuff and have settled down a bit There are times when they go into Spinal Tap type of material where they deliver deadpan satire then they break into laughs and giggles that kind of ruins it The interviews with Moses Znaimer a Canadian media mogule and Terry David Mulligan Music dude are extremely pretentious and verge into Tap territory unintentionallybr br This movie doesnt really document very much either I mean its basically one show and at the start of the film they are already huge and have a massive touring entourage its not like we see them rising from obscurity and surprise they are popular its a methodically planned out event so in the end its rather lifeless kind of half live concert half documentary and not much of eitherbr br ,negative
Unconditional Love is one of the best movies Ive seen in a while Its an emotional rollercoaster One of my favorite scenes is the pub scene When Dirk tells Grace that he didnt want to go to the pub because the villagers dont like him you expect the worst When the old woman holds her glass up and says To the Memory of Victor Fox and the whole pub follows suit I wanted to cry The funeral scene is hysterical Julie does it in her typical Julie Andrews style Johnathan Pryce is excellent as Victor Grace is one of Kathy Bates best roles Meredith Eaton steals just about every scene that she is in Rupert Everett does some of his finest work in Unconditional as Dirk The Kiss between Rupert and Meredith took me to another bout of hysterics In this day and age of Gay rights being questioned I think this movie should be seen by all As a gay Man in my late 40s I have seen people lose everything when a loved one dies So kudos to all involved in the making of this film,positive
THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE Written by Mary Harron  Guinevere Turner Directed by Mary Harronbr br How do you define a person who has always been between two worlds one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption Especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point If youre director Mary Harron you dont shy away from showing the pushpull nature of THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE You allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of God and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance afforded to Page during her years as a pinup model By doing so audiences are offered a complex character that is propelled forward by a desire to leave her difficult past with a naive enjoyment in others lust for her and a struggle to reconcile her image in the eyes of God Come the right time it will no longer matter how many eyes are on her because there is only one pair that countsbr br Shot mostly in black and white with some unnecessary bursts of color THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE is at times a light humorous comedy making the film an enjoyable experience and also one that pokes fun at how seriously people believe in the corruption of pornography But the delicate hand of the director is more palpably felt during Pages times of despair Harron is a sensitive considerate director who does not throw Pages numerous and devastating blows of abuse in the face of her viewer Instead she allows the surprisingly effective Gretchen Moll who plays the title role the chance to hammer the pain of her character into the viewer with fear in her eyes exhaustion is her cries and shame on her skin Whereas most directors perhaps most male directors would find it essential to show the heroine in painful positions in order to draw a link between the kinds of atrocities that were put upon her and where her life took her Harron has too much compassion for her character her actress and her audience From fragility Page learns to trust people again and as more and more photographers fall in love with her image the more she falls in love with their admiration and the control she has over the gaze By the time her poses cross over into the realm of softcore SM she has found a way to combine her need to be respected with the objectification she has been accustomed to her whole lifebr br Mary Harrons Bettie Page is a woman who yearns for control over her life and destiny yet ultimately is always being told where to stand how to smile and what to wear When she finally realizes that none of her choices have been her own she chooses to embrace God and preach his word to those who will listen The true sadness behind this most important decision is that she is still letting someone else guide her blindly she just has more faith that this direction will be better for her soul,positive

Annie Potts is the only highlight in this truly dull film Mark Hamill plays a teenager who is really really really upset that someone stole the Corvette he and his classmates turned into a hotrod quite possibly the ugliest looking car to be featured in a movie and heads off to Las Vegas with Annie to track down the evil genius who has stolen his pride and joybr br I would have plucked out my eyes after watching this if it wasnt for the fun of watching Annie Potts in a very early role and its too bad for Hamill that he didnt take a few acting lessons from her Danny Bonaduce also makes a goofy cameo,negative
an very good storyline good thrill to it  but the 10 last seconds destroyed the whole movie what happened extremely well made and an good story destroyed in the last seconds sorry to say but a 1 in vote thats what it it deserve i would think that Chris Shadley could come up with a better end but maybe next time   all this meaningless blood gore for nothing the end would lift the story to close to a 10 but it didnt the end destroyed the whole story i think most people arent lame and when they goes a movie thy want a good end even if it is intricate  but the only lame here is the end sorry,negative

If it is true that sadomasochism is a twosided coin which contains the whole in the diverse expression of its opposites then the cinematic portrait of Erika Kohut has its reality Professor Kohut treats her piano students with a kind of fascist sadism while longing for the same for herself Her outward expression projects her desire That is why she can hurt without guilt or remorsebr br Along comes talented charming handsome young Walter Klemmer Benoit Magimel who is attracted to her because of her passion and her intensity He wants to become her student so as to be close to her She rejects him out of hand but because of his talent the Vienna conservatory votes him in He falls in love with her Again she pushes him away but he will not take no for an answer and thereby begins his own descent into depravity and loss of selfrespectbr br The question the viewer might ask at this point is who is in control The sadist or the masochist Indeed who is the sadist and who the masochist It is hard to tell Is it the person who has just been greatly abused both psychologically and physically who is actually lying wounded on the floor in grotesque triumphant and fulfillment or is it the person who is rushing out the door sated giving the order that no one is to know what happenedbr br But Erika is not just a sadomasochistic freak She is a sex extreme freak She wants to experience the extremes of human sexuality while maintaining the facade of respectability Actually that isnt even true She says she doesnt care what others think She doesnt care if they walk in and find her bleeding on the floor because she is in love Love she calls it For her sex and love are one and the samebr br At one point Walter tells her that love isnt everything How ironic such a superfluity is to her How gratuitous the commentbr br The movie is beautifully cut and masterfully directed by Michael Haneke who spins the tale with expert camera work and carefully constructed sets in which the essence of the action is not just clear but exemplified as in the bathroom when Walter propels himself high above the top of the stall to find Erika within He also employs a fine positioning of the players so that they are always where they should be with well timed cuts from one angle to another This is particularly important in the scene in which Erika like a blooddrained corpse caught in stark white and black light lies under her lover rigid as stone Here for the most part we only see her face and the stark outline of her neck with its pulsating artery We dont need to see any morebr br The part of Erika Kohut is perfect for Isabelle Huppert who is not afraid of extremes indeed she excels in them I have seen her in a number of movies and what she does better than almost anyone is become the character body and soul Like the woman she plays in this movie she is unafraid of what others may think and cares little about her appearance in a decorative sense What matters to her is the performance and the challenge No part is too demanding No character too depraved Its as if Huppert wants to experience all of humanity and wants us to watch her as she does She is always fascinating and nearly flawless She is not merely a leading light of the French cinema she is one of the great actresses of our time who has put together an amazingly diverse body of workbr br I think it is highly instructive and affords us a wonderful and striking contrast to compare her performance here with her performance in The Lacemaker La Dentellière from 1977 when she was 22 years old There she was apple sweet in her red hair and freckles and her pretty face and her cute little figure playing Pomme a Parisian apprentice hairdresser Her character was shy about sex and modestjust an ordinary French girl who hoped one day to be a beautician Here she is a selfdestructive witch bitter with hateful knowledge of herself shameless and entirely depravedbr br Huppert is fortunate in being an actress in France where there are parts like this for women past the age of starlets Hollywood could never make a movie like this In the American cinema only a handful of the very best and hardest working actresses can hope to have a career after the age of about thirty Huppert greatly increases her exposure because of her ability and range but also because she is willing to play unsympathetic roles here and also in La Cérémonie 1995 in which she plays a vile spiteful murderessbr br Do see this for Isabelle Huppert You wont forget her or the character she brings to life,positive

I expected so much more than what I received from watching this movie It is not that I object to literary license if that is what it should be called especially when there is no overt attempt to say based on a true story But this movie is about Beethoven  a real historical person who is so widely known and so deeply embedded into our musical experiences and I expected the movie to be true to history at least in the primary elements This movie took such great exception from the historic record it could only disappointbr br My assumption because I had not researched the movie at all was that it was true Half way through I stopped the movie to look it up on IMDb The rest of the movie was a remarkably different experience I was relieved that this was not accurate with history because it was so hard to believe a major portion of the story To enjoy this movie I was required to recognize it as a fantasy a what if it was like this story The movie lacked this honest disclaimerbr br What disappointed me most was the fictionalized conducting of the 9th symphony The very concept portrayed in the film stretched my imagination to the point of incredulity I ended up doubting anything was true to history other than Ludwig van Beethoven and his relationship with Karl van Beethovenbr br I really enjoyed the performance of Ed Harris  an exceptional actor who knows how to play a role and keep himself out of it and that was about it and for that I give it a 310br br Those who portend that this movie is as good as or better than Amadeus have not a clue about either either composers life and are looking only for what this movie really is for in the end it was a cheap novel of a story  pulp fiction,negative

I learned a thing you have to take this film like a funny period comedy if you dont want to be disappointed The films enjoyable because its a delicious comedy I think the overhype damaged it the too much glorified Monica Bellucci appears in few scenes and isnt so good as they wanted to let you believe She sounds unnatural false the best actress in this film is Sabrina Impacciatore who speaks with a perfect Tuscan accent and shines together with Massimo Ceccherini Elio Germano is very very good the most promising young Italian actor according to me Daniel Auteuil looks like Napoleon but I preferred other actors So the most hyped performances were also the worstbr br Costumes and production design are okay sure American period movies are more accurate about these things because have bigger budgets but the Italian ability rewards the lack of money A nice period comedy in short with a firstrate casting except for Bellucci and Auteuil,positive
You will be able to tell within the first 30 seconds of this film whether you want to finish watching it The film opens with images of planes landing at an airport one plane after another diving into a miragefilled runway You will be able to accurately guess that this movie is not about a story At first viewing its even easy to think the opening images are repetitive shots of the same plane The initial drama is in the acuteness of your perception which is built on your willingness to experience the film simply as a series of images If after this opening you want to see the movie you will not be bored You may even be mesmerized The movie may be an emotional experience it may be an intellectual experience it may be both Judging from the DVD commentary which is essential it was primarily an emotional experience for Herzog and at one point he talks explicitly about how the film is a collaboration between filmmaker and viewer Theres plenty of room for the viewer to make of this film exactly what he or she wants to make of it Take a gamble,positive

I cannot believe I never added my two cents about this film as yetbr br This is one of the best films of all time Many critics and moviegoers alike talk of John Carpenters Halloween for setting trends and being his best work Those folks have not seen this version of The Thing because it is right up there with Halloweenbr br John Carpenters work shines in this film He took a film that was already made and instead of remaking the film he made the book the first film was based on Brilliantbr br The casting of each man was great the tension between them was real it made me scream made me scared made me guess made me laugh made me question even up to today who goes there in that film This film had no Hollywood sweetie pie or funnytype ending and what a bold move not to have one in 1982 Another brilliant movebr br I was at the screening for this film when I was on vacation in Southern California The audience at the screening went wild I carry those memories for years it was so much fun We all thought that there was no way on Gods green earth this film was not going to be a hit But by box office receipts it was a dud because of ET The Extra Terrestrial and Poltergeist two very good family oriented films took the box office in 1982 when this film came outbr br This film was what I as a horror film adult buff was looking for a horrorthriller with an adult script and real adult actors Not kids playing adults Not little Miss bigbreasted screamqueen of the day running around screaming for titilation BUT real guys with real problems delivering some of the best monologues youll ever hear Heck being a feminist I didnt even MISS women in this film And good for Mr Carpenter by not putting one in there it really wouldnt have made sense Unless The Thing was actually feminine Something to think aboutbr br I saw special effects of that time I had never seen before I saw makeup that made me sit up a few nights This is what horrorthrillers of today are missing Today the Directors wimp out Today the Studios wimp out Too much CGI and not enough belief too much CGI and not enough story not enough imagination You leave the theater and in a week  or less  you forget about the film and move onto the next grand film opening This one stays with ya Thats one of the marks of an excellent filmbr br On many reviews Ive written how now paying 10 for a film is horrid For films like this one youd pay it and not feel slighted This film is NOT for everyonebr br I find it horrific that they lable this film a cult film I find that the audience is broader than many would lead you to belive and although not a commercial success in 1982 this is an example of how releasing a darn good film on the wrong date can make a darn good film look bad After John Carpenters film many people copied many techniques makeup special effects and story lines from this version of The Thingbr br I am now excitd to go on record and state that this film is one of the best films of all time very much under rated Please see it uncut please see it in letterbox and please hear it digitally Youll talk about it for years as well,positive
Not even original in the plot Ho hum There were a couple of angles that could have been quite interesting but the film follows the path of 90 of Hollywood movies I dont really get Samuel Jacksons acting most of the time in his other films but he was rather good in this film He rarely yelled and went much further in his character rather than reverting to an in your face anger I liked Eva Mendes  as usual  and even though she is great eye candy she proves herself to be much more than that as an actress Luis Guzman was actually really good also except that I disliked the change of his character towards Samuel Jackson at the end of the film How can ones character center around a dislike for a former cop and then turn into lollipop land within a split second Is there no original thought left in Hollywood,negative
I really enjoyed this documentary about Kenny and Spencers attempt to pitch The Dawn Was a great look at how outsiders try to get to the inside to make it big br br The story was put together well and organized in an interesting manner that made the film flow well Certainly worth a watch My only complaint is that their appeared to be no closure Perhaps that is part of the point We expect it but in reality that is not what happened or usually happensbr br The film is also a great way to see the personality of Kenny and Spencer outside of their Canadian television show You can see a bit of what is yet to come br br I look forward to a chance to see The Papal Chase,positive
Proud as i am of being a Dutchman im truly shocked by flicks like these Why why this cheap acting Why this storyline that just sucks why a dozen sequels why o why they add a lot of hot Dutch chicks in an effort of saving this movie from redemption and guess what all the underaged breezergirlies in Holland go and see it I was forced to watch it at a party all the girls were going crazy when Daan Schuurmans entered the screen all the guys took a another beer and grumbled But the thing that really bothers me is the fact that this kind of flicks are the only sort of movies Dutch filmmakers can produce apart from Van God Los and Lek This doesnt prove our superiority to other countries It doesnt add anything to our imagination It just Fks up the brains of little 13 year old girls Johan Nijenhuis I hope you will burn forever,negative
A halfhearted attempt to bring Elvis Presley into the modern day but despite a sexy little shower scene and a pseudoPlayboy magazine subplot Presley is surrounded by the same old coy winking clichés A woman picks EP up on the beach and then proceeds to take over his lifeand he doesnt seem to care Dick Sargent is grueling in another sidebar but Don Porter and Rudy Vallee  try hard as Elvis two bosses hes moonlighting you see Some of the songs are quite good especially Almost in Love but if you want to see a looser hipper updated Elvis sexcomedylook elsewhere When Elvis and his Fatal Attraction get into bed together theres actually a wooden board in between them Get real  from ,negative
Ru Paul plays a secret agent called Starrbooty She teams up with another drag queen agent to fight the evil Annaka Manners Candis Cayneand get her kidnapped niece backor something like that Seriously I had trouble concentrating on the plot The movie is seemingly directed by somebody with severe ADDquick camera cuts nonstop that make it impossible to focus on anything The dialogue is incomprehensible at times and when you can hear it you wish it remained incomprehensible The acting is actually pretty OK except for Ru Paul who overacts to an embarrassing degree Also the film is full of disgusting bathroom humor that is just revolting and not even remotely funny After 30 minutes I had to leave because I was bored sick and just couldnt stand it anymore I pride myself on sitting through anything but this went WAY beyond my limits People are comparing this to the early work of John Waters I disagree Waters work is sick but goodthis is just sick Avoid,negative
And how many actors can he get to stand in for his own neurotic compulsive uberNew Yorker persona In this film Woody is played by Will Ferrell in what is mercifully less a direct impersonation than the one Kenneth Branagh did in Celebrity Its an annoyingly repetitive story now nebbishy neurotic man with a wife or girlfriend falls madly in love with a shiksa queen upon which he projects all manner of perfection Everyone lives in perfect gigantic apartments in great Manhattan neighborhoods everyone constantly patronizes expensive exclusive restaurants during which all the characters relate fascinating anecdotes and discuss arcane philosophy there is always a trip to the Hamptons during which the nebbishy main character spazzes out about sand and physical exertion and possible exposure to diseases and then of course said main character feels guilty about his lust for the shiksa queen but pursues her anyway sometimes succeeding sometimes failing etcbr br This a tired formula and proof that Allen isnt really a great film artist at all He just seems like a dirty old man with the libido and emotions of a 20yearold who is intent upon telling the same boring old stories again and again,negative
This 1988 movie was shown recently on a cable channel We wanted to see another film which supposedly was starting but because a mix up RentaCop was shown in that time slot Never having seen it when it was commercially released we took a chance at it Bad decisionbr br One wonders what possessed the people behind the picture to go ahead with RentaCop or how they sold it to the studio behind the distribution It appears this movie misfired big time This film doesnt add anything new to its genre Its totally predictable as once the basic premise is shown we know how it will endbr br Burt Reynolds plays a wooden Church This actor can do better but who knows what was going on behind the scenes or perhaps the direction given to him by Jerry London had the opposite effect Mr Reynolds has one expression throughout the movie He just doesnt register any emotion at allbr br Lisa Minnelli as the hooker who witnessed the original slaughter at the Chicago hotel makes no sense at all The romance between her Della and Church seems phony from the beginning She and Mr Reynolds play one dimensional charactersbr br Dont waste your time with this turkey,negative
It is a very great film documentary about Istanbul and their people and its music of every kind Editing and the success of the director is very impressive Ive been interested with Faith Akin since I saw the Gegen die Wand HeadOn Duvara Kars305 and I admired his work very much but this one has been the most touching one for me so Im here writing this It is not just about Turks or something like that it is a very good biography of a city and how music stay alive in it we can say There are views of many people and so very variant ideas about even life and love I liked it very much and I thing anyone and everyone should see it NOT ONLY but especially the ones anyhow related with Turkey,positive

I watch them allbr br Its not better than the amazing ones _Strictly Ballroom_ _Shall we dance_ Japanese version but its completely respectable and pleasingly different in partsbr br I am an English teacher and I find some of the ignorance about language in some of these reviews rather upsetting For example the name should scream dont watch How she move Since when can movie titles ignore grammar br br There is nothing inherently incorrect about Caribbean English grammar Its just not Canadian standard English grammar Comments about the dialogue seem off to me I put on the subtitles because Im a Canadian standard English speaker so I just AUTOMATICALLY assumed that I would have trouble understanding all of it It wasnt all that difficult and it gave a distinctly different flavour as the other step movies I have seen were so Americanbr br I loved that this movie was set in Toronto and in fact wish it was even more clearly set there I loved that the heroine was so atypically cast I enjoyed the stepping routines I liked the driven Mum character I felt that many of the issues in the movie were addressed more subtly than is characteristic of dance moviesbr br In summary if you tend to like dance movies then this is a decent one If you have superiority issues about the grammar of the English standard you grew up speaking your narrow mind may have difficulty enjoying this movie,positive
I dont understand how some people can stand playing HalfLife CounterStrike when there are so many better firstperson shooting games availablebr br CounterStrike is a game that doesnt use any imaginative ideas in its weaponry All the weapons in the game are reallife weapons but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a supernatural weapon like the allpowerful BFG in the Quake  Doom gamesbr br Another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually This can become extremely annoying especially while in the middle of a firefight when you are so close to killing the enemy The reloading delay also gives the feeling that the gun is slow at performing its taskbr br There are not many choices of characters to choose from If I remember correctly there are 4 types of characters each for the Terrorist and CounterTerrorist forces This means that many of the characters look the same as each other which really brings down the games realismbr br The game is pretty sexist when it comes to character selections In the early version of CounterStrike there was a woman available to choose in the Terrorist force selection which was good for the female gamers In the latest versions however the female character was deleted and replaced with another male character I wonder if the women who played the game were disappointed at the newer versionsbr br Finally the maps in the game are very small The biggest map seems to be the desert map but it has standard detail In fact all the maps in the game have standard graphics In other words nothing newbr br To sum up I think HalfLife CounterStrike is the most unimaginative firstperson shooting game of all time There are plenty of better  more imaginative shooting games to play so why waste your time on this boring game Youre better off playing the Unreal Tournament Quake and Doom games Avoid this overrated  overhyped gamebr br I give the game a 110,negative

Holes is an awesome movie I love it a lot and its one of my favorite films Its one of the few flicks produced by Disney that isnt cheesy Holes is generally a very cool motion picture I wish Disney would make more pictures like it Holes is indeed a rare breed of Disney flicker shows that is cool Dont get the wrong idea I dont mean to bad mouth Disney but most of its stuff is aimed towards kids and THATS OKAY Children deserve to have their entertainment too But Disney has been guilty of trying to appeal to the teen audience and they usually fail But not with Holes Its the type of movie anyone of any age can watch and enjoy and not once think its corny Really its the kind of movie that even a lot of young hoods might enjoy since there are characters in it that they can relate tobr br Holes does a good job of being a mix of good family entertainment but not being too cheesy and living a little on the edge I hope Disney takes more risks and makes more edgy flicks like this,positive

Have you ever tried a kind of food that your friend made and then said to yourself wow that was not a good mix Well that is how I felt after watching this filmbr br Many viewers will be left highly uncomfortable with this weird mix of crime and very very corny comedy Its almost like watching Mr Rogers play a ruthless gangster very weird Some things just dont mix and this film clearly proves thatbr br There are some very good performances here as Dean Stockwell Mercedes Ruhle and Alec Baldwin are all excellent but that doesnt make up for the lack of balance and symmetry in the filmbr br Jonathan Demme has done some excellent work in films such as Silence of the Lambs and Philadelphia but seems to be out of his element with this one,negative

This film to me deserves a lot of praise because even though I am not a surfer or skater I remained inspired throughout the whole documentarybr br The depth of history and development of these two extreme sports emphasised what they were able to do for two groups of individuals The dedication that these individuals hadhave is truly inspiring and it was because of them that others can now enjoy and do what these guys foundedbr br Unlike most other documentaries this one was cleverly put together the amount of footage that was recorded and survived throughout the decades is outstanding and it was because of this that some of the greatest editing I have ever seen was put together and resulted in the subject remaining focused Without the urge for them to retort to recent footage of the more famous surfers and skaters that remains popular todaybr br The film explores areas such as the success such accomplishing new tricks winning competitions and gathering fame As well as failures such as injury or burning outbr br It was also fulfilling to hear the experiences come from the skaters and surfers themselves and not from second hand information This resulted in a better picture to be drawnbr br Overall a truly outstanding effort,positive
Loosely intended as a satire of DW Griffiths Intolerance The Three Ages was Buster Keatons first attempt at a full length comedy feature The only similarities to Intolerance are the opening book scene and the fact that similar stories through the ages are edited together into a complete film Keatons reasoning for appropriating this style was that if it didnt succeed as a feature film it could be reduced to three tworeelers Fortunately The Three Ages succeeds brilliantly as a comedy and contains some of the funniest routines Ive seen in any of Keatons film There is nothing unique or daring about the story lines They are simple boymeetsgirl boylosesgirl boygetsgirl plots but the period satires are riotous and set the standard for future works by Mel Brooks and all films of this genre However I dont believe that anyone has ever topped this comedy No one can play the lovable goof like Keaton and the stunts in this film are some of his best In addition Wallace Beerys appearance as Keatons rival adds to this films appeal Anyone who thinks that comedy from the 1920s cannot be appreciated by modern audiences needs to see this movie,positive
I just watched this movie in high definition on television I am in a wheelchair due to a neuromuscular disorder and like to watch the few films made about those with physical disabilitiesbr br At first I found the main character somewhat noble and captivating His message about the disabled and the life time he spent fighting to have the disabled recognized and integrated into mainstream societys job market is great And my problem isnt with the real person who did these things HE was a great man But this film is completely hypocritical and diametrically opposed to the very message it is preaching that I found it insultingbr br First of all they didnt cast anyone in a title role with an actual physical disability Sure they were competent actors but it seems completely dis genuine to preach about hiring the disabled and then not actually HIRING THE DISABLED for anything in the film Further compounded by the fact that in one scene mid way through the film a man is seen walking to a podium on crutches appearing to have only one leg But the CGI in this scene is so apparent it is shameful What They couldnt find an actual amputee anywhere for the film For a 5 second shot it was more financially sound to do CGI effects than to just HIRE an ACTUAL amputee At that point in the film I found it so fraudulent and completely against the message it was trying to convey that I came here to bitch and whine about it like the pathetic cripple I ambr br Figure that out,negative
This movie is horrible if you pay attention to it Its a perfect movie if you just watch the colorful images dance across the screen  each one with no apparent connection to the next I rented this movie because Im a David Bowie fan and I really appreciate musicals In finality Bowie was in the film for a total of ten minutes and the songs and dance sequences were sparse and left something to be desired The moral of the story was really befuddling I couldnt tell if it was about racial issues in London in the 1950s or about not selling out For the first half of the movie I was chuckling at how cheesy it was but I liked the campiness of the no selling out message When blacks started being murdered I thought my tape had gotten messed up Maybe I rented half of two different movies Nope there was a Keep Britain White song and dance sequence Im sorry but WWII is not something you can write a musical about At least not a musical that could conceivably be described as campy as I have several times in this review Overall Id say this movie could do a whole lot better if it made up its mind and cast better actors And put David Bowie in it for longer goddammit My grade C,negative

As I am a fan of hospital and medical shows I have found this one gripping and sometimes humorous especially the scenes with Dr Whitman which brings a bit la light relief However I was looking forward to the last episode because I expected that the bad ones would be punished and the good ones reinstated Instead of that the hospital management are making even more fools of themselves in an unbelievable manner and its getting worse and worse for the good ones You cant help wondering what the unions are doing or doesnt Rob Donna and Maria know what unions are there for  Besides never seeing the outside trees grass sunlight is a bit oppressive Anyone understood what the last words were  ie the answer Rob Lake gave to Mrs Strawberrys children question Why are you telling us all that It was very frustrating not to be able to understand it,negative
I just rented and watched this movie just to see whats all the fuss about So heres what my reactions to it are Its easily seen that this is a low budget film with poor actors The main plot of this movie is about a woman getting revenge on her rapists This concept if done right could easily turn out to be a really provocative film However the movie doesnt shock or disturb me at all It just bored me This movie could be easily shortened to under 45 minutes All lot of scenes are mainly there to fill in time like those scenery scenes and some scenes I described belowbr br Contains spoiler I find the rape scenes quite tame I dont know if I have watched the cut or uncut version if there is actually such a version I also found many plot holes within the already badly written plot Heres a list on top of my mindbr br Why dont the rapists rape Jennifer during the night when she walked out her house to find out what those noise are That would be an excellent timebr br Why dont they just gang rape her instead of delaying some of the rapists the pleasure and lengthening Jennifers ordeal by such a long time It would probably be more shocking and disturbing that waybr br I found it really stupid that the rapists left her in the forest and head back to her house Maybe to show that these rapists are really imbecilesbr br These rapists should at least know that if you want to do a dirty job right they shouldnt send a coward imbecile to do the jobbr br Why didnt Jennifer call the police when the rapists finally left Which should be the first thing that pops up in most peoples mind especially for someone who is a writer br br Why didnt these rapists smell danger miles away when they saw Jennifer is alivebr br I find it really amazing that a slender lady like Camille can pull a man up a tree and hang him Ends spoilerbr br But hey this movie is not without its merits Camille Keaton is gorgeous and I get to hear one of the funniest line I have recently heard when Matthew protest of going back into the house and kills Jennifer Why me Why Me I didnt even cm,negative
Critters 3 starts on the open road as Clifford John Calvin his teenage daughter Annie Aimee Brooks  his young son Johnny the IMDb list two actors Christian  Josephh Cousins identical twins perhaps are heading back home from a vacation Suddenly the tyre on their van blows  they have to stop at a public rest area to fix it While there Annie  Johnny meet a kid named Josh Leonardo DiCaprio yes that one who in turn all run into Charlie McFadden the films coproducer Don Keith Opper from the previous two Critter films Charlie tells them the story of the Critters  the town of Grovers Bend but they dont believe him Meanwhile back at the van a Critter lays some eggs on its underside out of sight from everyone Once Clifford has fixed the tyre the trio set off for their home a run down urban tenement block in Los Angeles somewhere complete with Critter eggs along for the ride Upon arrival the eggs hatch  the Critters head straight inside the tenement block quickly disposing of Frank Geoffrey Blake the caretaker As the night draws on the few remaining residents a fat woman named Rosalie Diana Bellamy a telephone repair woman Marsha Katherine Cortez an elderly couple Mr Bill Zuckert  Mrs Menges Frances Bay must come together with Clifford  his kids to fight the Critters Josh also makes an appearance as his Stepfather William Dennis Hunt owns the building But will the group be able to defeat the Critters  prevent themselves from becoming dinnerbr br Directed Kristine Peterson I thought Critters 3 was an incredibly undistinguished film but at least she can say she made a film staring Leonardo DiCaprio  not many people can say that The budget for Critters 3 probably wasnt exactly a fortune as the whole production looks cheap throughout there are very few characters very few Critters  I think only 3 ever appear in the same shot at once  it does away with any sort of space angle so there are no expensive spaceship or distant alien planet special effects to pay for The script by David J Schow is strictly bythenumbers  very predictable A group of humans are stuck in an isolated situation with Critters  have no means of contacting the outside world for help that plot scenario sounds very familiar right Well its same as the previous Critters 1986  Critters 2 The Main Course 1988  many other horror films so it should Critters 3 does nothing with the premise it never even tries to add anything to an already old tired  well used storyline Critters 3 is also very tame for a horror film with only two people actually being killed the comedy elements are seriously lacking as well with the best joke Critters 3 can mange being a Critter eating some beans  then farting very funny if your about 5 years old The characters are mostly standard horror film clichés  quickly became annoying There is virtually no blood or gore in Critters 3 at all just a few splashes of blood  disappointingly Critters 3 in fact seems to go out of its way not to show any violence The special effects on the Critters are OK but they still look like static simplistic handpuppets that have very little movement The acting isnt that good  Critters 3 happens to be a certain Leonardo DiCaprios very first feature film to be fair to the kid hes alright  I wonder if any of the other cast or crew had an idea what he go on to become Why on Earth does that Charlie guy have to keep popping up in these Critter films To give Critters 3 some credit it moves along at a good pace  isnt boring its generally well made with nice enough production values  its a bit of harmless fun if your in the right sort of mood  thankfully it only lasts for about 80 odd minutes Overall Critters 3 is an OK time waster but dont expect anything deep or meaningful Theres nothing really wrong with it as cheap horror film but I couldnt help feeling that Id seen it all before An average timewaster that isnt as good as either of the previous two Critter films Critters 3 ends with a to be continued as this was filmed back to back with Critters 4 1991 which unsurprisingly went straight to video probably to save even more money Critters 3 is a decent enough way to waste 80 odd minutes if you can watch it on TV for free otherwise dont bother,negative

I had the good fortune of reading the book before seeing the movie It was an epic of adolescence a dream of summers gone a great potential indie film or big budget drama It somehow got into the hands of a hack who clearly took notes watching Boogie Nights and Rushmore without actually learning anything at all The script loses the meat of the book in favor of forced emotional notes and low brow gags I feel sorry for the actors since the characters in the book were rich and textured but cut down to embarrassing charactures in the film Mason Gamble is great when given the opportunity as is Dylan Baker but the skeleton that remains of the story plays out like a bad after school special Poor people  GOOD Rich people  BAD br br Though its almost worth watching to see the Southern California beach where Gary Sinise parks his trailer which is meant to pass for a bay in Delaware br br Its a good book but an embarrassing turn for first time director Mills Goodloe br br K,negative

This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny When I saw this film I saw it for John Candy and assumed incorrectly that it would be hilarious Instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments And to top it off Candy delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time So despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find a few laughs Its really a shameit could have been so much better I mean with Eugene Levy Joe Flaherty and John Candy it SHOULD have been wonderful,negative

The first time I saw Brotherhood of Satan I was 12 yrs old I saw it in a little town in central Washington state it played before Tales from the crypt which we left early because my sisters were already scared from the Brotherhood of Satan All in all I thought it was a pretty good movie The beginning was good we had just sat down and that tank did a number on that station wagonbr br What struck me about the movie was the scenery around the town in which it was filmed it looked almost like the area around Chelan WA where I saw the movie especially when they were driving towards the town of Hillsboro which is the location of the movie a small town in SW New Mexico I have always liked LQ Jones and Strother Martin and also Charles Bateman who was on Get Smart another show I like I gave the movie a 7 and later on when I did get to see Tales from the crypt I thought Brotherhood of Satan was better,positive

I remember that the trailer for Legend of Zu was quite impressive and being a fan of A Man Called Hero my all time favourite Storm Riders I decided that I must watch this one too I know that there is way to much critcism on Ekin Chengs acting ability everywhere but he is my favourite Hong Kong moviestar so far way better than Nicolas Tse neverthelessand he is one of the factors that I enjoyed this movie Without a doubt this film is a work of art from the beginning to the end I even thought that only the actors were real and everything else was computer generated by the end of this film They must have put a lot of work into this one and they deserve good credit for that The storyline of the movie was a fairytale between good and evil with a love story thrown in I guess Ekin Cheng pulls the girls easilyThe story is not very intellectual and deep but that is not what you expect when watcing an action movie I wished there were more martial arts action with fists and fist instead of battles with magical abilities but well thats life and it never goes the way you want it to And why did they sound like supersonic planes in the battle through the sky in the end  Thats way too funny Legend of Zu cannot be A Man Called Hero in my eyes but it flows like a videogame and that is not a bad thing at all If a company decides to publish games on this movie I will not get suprised as it carries all the videogames elements Good work Please make more fantasy movies like this,positive

Although I do not recommend this film neither do I recommend reading this review without first seeing the movie Though I have not given away the ending or most of the plot twists this movie would be best viewed without any prior information Its hard to pinpoint the chief problem with the film Donnie Darko as there are many to deal with Richard Kelly in his first feature film seems to have collected enough scenes of adolescent rage latenight stoner diatribes selfrighteous justifications and inoffensive banal philosophy to inspire twenty teenangst dramas then mashed them into a single two hour package with a scifi twist The result is deeply distressing for all the wrong reasons The film attempts to lead the audience down convoluted paths without any sense of symbolism or meaning to make them sympathize with onedimensional characters and above all hopes that they will ignore the underdeveloped plot full of unreconciled loose ends by hiding it under a veneer of CGI effects and neosurrealism The main character Donnie Darko is a young man committed to therapy misunderstood by his friends and rendered hostile and disaffected by his suburban life We are meant to feel that he is more intelligent than his schoolmates although sometimes that is a difficult assumption to make For example when one of his friends comes up with an absurd theory about the Smurfs and Donnie counters with a theory of his own his friend complains about Donnie acting all smart Donnies speech however is no smarter than that of his friend just angrier The only clear evidence of his intelligence is his principals description of his standardized test scores as intimidating but given the directors slant against simple categorization of human elements as shown in the FEARLOVE sequence this is a poor substitute for character development Donnie takes prescribed drugs to combat mental problems which are not addressed directly in this film In fact the entire issue of the drugs is understated and one of the first chances the director has to redeem the film is lost The ambiguity of Donnies strange destiny the possibility that all of this may be a product of his imagination is pushed into the background making the film 100 percent science fiction This would not be a bad thing in itself except that the science behind the fiction is very shaky The explanations of time travel are weak at best sounding like detached uninformed rambling We get the idea that the films writer once read a book about time travel or a few chapters and cant quite remember how it worked but was sure that it was really interesting and wanted to work it into the film The scientific portion as a result depends more heavily on expensive computer animations than actual development of the theories involved at one point a teacher discussing time travel states that if he continues to speak on the subject hed be fired Apparently no further explanation is needed Donnies dealings with a visitor from the future lead him to commit several vicious actions The justification for these actions is a tricky business He damages his school but its okay because his school doesnt treat him like a person His punishment of a creepy selfesteem advocate somewhat similar to Tom Cruises character in Magnolia results in the mans public humiliation But should the audience believe that Donnie is some sort of avenging angel striking out against ignorance and debauchery He himself seems ignorant of the effects of these actions until after the fact Aside from these flaws the film is riddled with flat uninteresting generalizations of humanity The story is set in 1988 just before the BushDukakis election and the director touches on this point during the film The focus however extends exactly this far Donnies gruff blue collar father is voting for Bush while his freespirited rebellious daughter plans to vote for Dukakis There is nothing even remotely resembling a political statement here simply a statement of the obvious The former are not necessary to make a good film but the latter should be left out Likewise Donnies heartfelt speech about not being able to lump all human emotions into the bland categories of fear and love this doesnt ask the audience to make any great leaps of understanding Everybody knows that there are more that two human emotions and particular emphasis on this fact is worthless Mr Kelly gives homage to several symbols of 80s pop culture in his film ET Stephen King the Smurfs Back to the Future At its heart this film feels like the directors homage to himself a collection of his own experiences interests personal heroes and adversaries affirmations and disenchantments roughly stitched together by untrained hands Entire songs are played in music video format to the characters actions seemingly because the director likes the songs Characters who have little to no bearing on the plot including the archetypal bully fat girl and rightwing idiot teacher are given unnecessary focus because the director really wanted to pack them in somehow The awkward mess that is Donnie Darko leaves us wondering if Mr Kelly has enough ideas left in his head to make another film or if he has wasted all his creativity in one pointless cluttered meandering effortbr br My rating 110,negative
This was a great 1981 film which had a great story about three men and two girls who go on a camping trip together and go through thick woods and high mountains with a great water fall This group of people run into property owned by George Kennedy Roy McLean who plays the role as a Forest Ranger and rides a white horse Roy McLean warns these young people that where they are going is no area for camping and they should turn back Of course these young people pay no attention and proceed to have a ball swimming in the nude near the water fall and playing great music and dancing by the fire and having plenty of beer and wine There is an old wooden one room school house that draws the gals and guys inside and it is from that point on the film starts to get very scary There is one occasion when a young girl has to climb a tree in order to get away from a human beast who desires her body and starts chopping the tree down in order to capture her Dont miss this film there is plenty of everything,positive

The reviewer who called this movie a bust has clearly missed the point Its obvious he hasnt been young or innocent in a very long time or he might have understood that the tragedy of it was that the wellmeaning young characters actually thought they COULD make a difference by putting up posters and holding a rave for peace If only it was that easy But the cynics sit and sneer at people who earnestly try their best to make things better as the situation gets worse and worse every single day Well if youre not part of the solution youre part of the problembr br The central theme is that revenge begets more revenge which begets even more in an everexpanding bloodbath Both sides will tell you tales of atrocities committed by the other side which they think justify their committing even MORE in retaliation Where does it end And apparently he missed the significance of the bubble referred to in the name which was that people living in Tel Aviv are strangely cut off from the ugly realities of what is going on all around them which is partly why they seemed so naive He also seemed to think that Ashraf could slip through the checkpoints without a problem which tells me he wasnt paying attention when Ashraf related the delays and problems he had encountered br br I found it very brave of the director the screenplay writer and both starcrossed lovers to update the Romeo  Juliet story to a modern troubled land and to make both lovers male Lets be honest here Very few people would have a problem if one of them had been a female young love wins all hearts  but when peoples uneasiness with their sexuality is added to the fact that incredibly these same people would rather have them HATE each other then the conclusion is inevitable,positive
One Life Stand is an accomplished piece of film making which hasnt been given the credit it deserves Its IMDB rating of 17 doesnt do it justice and is perhaps due to the very few screenings it has had rather than the quality of the film itself Shot on digital in black and white the film is well directed with production values that belie its shoestring budget The performances are excellent particularly that of Gary Lewis who gets better with every role My only criticisms are that it is a bit on the long side and could have done with a touch more humour to offset the darker moments Overall though it is a fine piece of work,positive

Roy Scheider is not Steve McQueen or Clint Eastwood but then who is The SevenUps is one of the better cop movies even today and is second only to McQueens Bullitt and the Dirty Harry series which isnt bad company There are three things that seem to make a good cop movie Believable script with great acting great car chase scenes and some heavy action This movie has all three and the car chase scene is better than that in Dirty Harry Scheider plays the head of a group of cops out to get NYs bad guys sentenced to seven years or more hence the name SevenUps Overall not quite up to Dirty Harry or Bullitt but far better than all of the cop movies made since the Dirty Harry series 910,positive

I do not want to go into a criticism of the movie which I think is  for a big budget movie  quite exceptional and daringbr br I just wanted to remark that I am really fed up with the studios policies and the laws of different states which treat their viewers like children In the database we find at least 4 different versions of the movie according to running time But of course it is likely that there are much more different cutsbr br The result is complete confusion and you can never be sure to talk about the same movie unless you live in Argentina where the movie runs 115 minutes which sounds quite completebr br Later on DVD and Video the studios try to rob us further by selling us a presumable directors cut in Germany there is already such a version around running approx 110 minutesbr br It would be nice if the studios would not only think of the cash they make with their movies but also think of their products as a work of art even at the risk of an unfavourable rating so that I as a viewer dont have to feel cheated and am taken seriously not only as a resource of money,positive

PUT THE CAMERA ON ME is a deceptively cute film It is actually a complex glimpse at the psychology of children and offers interesting insights into the development of adults and an artist On the surface this is a nostalgic look at some home movies made in the 80s by a group of upper class neighborhood kids One of the films directors Darren Stein had access to a video camera and quickly took over as the artistic leader for all of the movies Sure these are just some cute kids having fun But this is also much more This is a look into some moments in time as children grapple with a number of confusing issues that all of us face in life  fear sexual awakening unrequited love loneliness and just trying to make sense of the adult world which seems to explode all around us As we get older we tend to forget how overwhlelming the realities of life were when we were little br br What makes this film all the more valid is to watch a young Darren Stein turn into a little general of a filmmaker It is clear that Darren is running this show and these little movies are his vision but they are all informed by his friends their problems the interpersonal dynamics and the general confusion regarding the horrors of adult life A lot of children make home movies but Ive never heard of or seen children create little movies about the holocaust homosexuality nuclear war and the inability to fit in and make friends These kids are confronting and dealing with some heavy stuff br br The power of this film is the way Stein and Shell pull various scenes together so tightly with running interviews with the kids  all now adults and all still friends This adds a new angle to the film How many of us have stayed in touch with our childhood friends These guys have And many of the issues with which they were dealing are still running between them two decades later br br Among the conflicts  a confession of a crush reveals a heart still broken a very normal childhood sexual experience continues to be a sticky subject between two of the men some ongoing resentments over the dynamics of relationships and there is still a member of this team who remains very much in charge and in center stage Which makes perfect sense as one watches these home movies progress over the course of a couple of years Darren Stein is a director No doubt about it br br Stein and Shell take turns chatting with each other from time to time and one cant help but imagine the awkwardness of allowing us to peek into the young lives of these people This is particularly true for Stein who has gone on to a great deal of success in the entertainment industry as a film producer writer and director From the first moment of PUT THE CAMERA ON ME we can see the emergence of a gay little boy trying to figure it all out We also see sides of the artistic mind and personality that are not always nice or caring  and this is a bold move for any artist to share with an audience br br There are so many revealing moments but the most disturbing and complex moments involve a movie in which we see a Jewish concentration camp victim being tortured and killed by a Nazi We discover thru interviews and narration that the Nazi is played by a Jewish child and the part of the victim is played by a gentile child It is a painfully disturbing moment that glimpses into the darker side of fear and the way children work thru the horrors of the adult world that are beyond adult understanding much less that of a child br br This is much more than some home movies This documentary captures the pain beauty joy and sadness of growing up Powerful stuff  and well worth seeing br br ,positive
Silly movie is really really funny Yes its got its dead moments it can be a bit too obvious it declines a bit in the second half and the story is an incoherent mess but its laugh out loud funny all the way And its worth seeing just for Ed McMahon as a right wing kook This movie is in the same class as Elvira Mistress of the Dark another incredibly funny underappreciated film,positive
I got to watch this movie in my french class as part of lets say french culture I thought the way it was filmed and the editing was real good but mostly it was entertaining especially the guy that played Wendys brother Also the story line was really good as well as it was believable and yet adventurous as wellbr br Favorite Part When William is making fun of the German guy studying and when he acts out how flies reproduce  br br My french isnt that good but with the subtitles i could pretty much get what was going on br br WATCH IT,positive
Great voices lots of adventure and clever dialogue make this a very good movie The addition of character to the three lead animals gives the story a lot more depth and meaning particularly the relationship between the older fellow Shadow and the young hellraiser Chance The earlier versions of this film were unable to give the animals any real personality or motive which is done perfectly here Sally Field is lovable in anything but really shines in this film as the proud feline Sassy Great contrast between cat and dog perspectives on life and just the right amount of spirit and warm fuzzies to make the plot and resolution excellent Theres even an uplifting score and beautiful mountain scenery Definitely perfect for an evening alone or with the kids Hats off to Disney,positive

Back in 1995 Barry Sonnenfeld directed a movie that ended up on many critics best of lists by the time the years recaps were being printed in entertainment publications The movie was Get Shorty and it gave lead star John Travolta his second big hit in as many years after Pulp Fiction put him back in front of the paparazzis lenses Based on a novel by Elmore Leonard the film focused on wise guy Chili Palmer Travolta and his attempts to break into the movie business I for one was completely captured by the diverse characters and crisp dialogue of the original So much so that when I heard there was going to be a sequel I seemed to forgo my usual shivering that occurs when a studio tries to rehash what was a good idea over ten years later The sequel also based on a novel by Leonard is this time directed by F Gary Gray whos Italian Job in 2003 was one of the years highest grossing films Couple that with the cast now expanding to include Uma Thurman Harvey Keitel Cedric the Entertainer The Rock Vince Vaughn and James Woods and you have all the makings of a great continuance in the exploits of one of the more interesting characters of the 1990s This time round we pick up as Chili Travolta is leaving the movie business after being disappointed in both himself and the industry for participating in the making of a sequel to his successful first film Thanks in small part to his friend Tommy Athens Woods and the misfortune of his death Chili decides to look into the lucrative and dangerous music industry This first leads to the famous Viper club where Chili meets singing sensation Linda Moon Christina Milian who as lead of an upstart trio can belt out tunes like Whitney Houston that is the Whitney before Bobby Brown started bringing home the small packages of sugar Linda is under contract with Raji Vaughn who with his overly apparent gay bodyguard Elliot Wilhelm The Rock plan to ensure Linda fulfills the final five years of her contract even if that means putting Chili on ice So with Lindas future in the balance Chili weaves an interesting web which will include a record producer Thurman a gangsta sound mixer Cedric the Russian mob the police Aerosmiths lead singer Steven Tyler and a whole lot of angry gun pointing WooWheee That sounds exciting So why wasnt it Be Cool tries too hard to well be cool But the result is a film that unlike the original has no heart and no soul Be Cool feels instead like it was directed by a Saturday Night Live producer as there are individual scenes or skits that dont string together over a whole movie Take for example the scene where Travolta and Thurman dance together for the first time since Pulp Fiction as Black Eyed Peas performs live in the background The scene is forced and should have ended up on the cutting room floor Instead it is coupled between two other needless chapters that do nothing to push the story forwards with any real thrust The Aerosmith concert and The Rocks trip to a boot shop are also prime examples of individual moments that dont amount to much of a movie when put together But those arent the only issues with the sequel  which could probably be renamed Product Placement with the amount of 2Ways and Diet Pepsis that seem to stare at you more intensely than Chilis serious look The story contains just about every stereotype imaginable and each one has just enough screen time to become slightly offensive or embarrassing Whether it is the gangsta entourage or the gay muscle guy that has a movie poster of Sylvester Stallones Rhinestone on the wall no characters is above offering us anything we havent seen many times before and in much better films With the magic all but gone from the first film we end up with an inferior product that is the second film in the past six months Oceans 13 being the other that cram a bunch of stars onto a marquee only to end up as a movie that no actor would bring to an open audition Be Cool was a major disappointment I so wanted it to be the Get Shorty of the new millennium and I ended up with a film where the outtakes must have been a gas but experience left me with a stinker,negative

Jeremy Irons and Forrest Whitaker are good actors But this movie was badly written First of all during the hijack scene Irons sits too comfortably in his chairhe appears to be READING something and rather calmly too Perhaps the director shot the actor in between takes Also the violence at the hijacking was a big letdown Slowmo bullets flyinghow his wife and daughter get killed is just not that interesting and the tension is lost His grieving afterward wasted another 10 minutes Then he decided to get revenge and talk to all his industry journalist friends and ambassadors hes a journalist for the stuffy Economist rag and lo and behold they actually give him tips on where to find the bad guys How do they know But what really made me turn the movie off halfway through was when Irons finds his way into a warehouse where baddies are hanging outBUT NOT THE BADDIES WHO KILLED HIS WIFEand blows them away anyway so hes just a murderer he gets away and wellI shut it off I mean I couldnt figure out how his friends knew anything and also I thought he was after the remaining 2 guys in custody who were the original hijackers Instead hes going after their friends I guess or anyone who hangs out in warehouses and leaves automatic weapons laying around The suspense was just totally conventional and the dialog was lame its OK son crying helps he says to his son Son says no it doesnt and father says Youre rightit doesntIrons takes on questionable roleslike that one dragon movie he did He was excellent in Brideshead Revisited which is a completely different animal than this lukewarm thriller,negative
No movie could ever do justice to Faulkners command of the English language but they did a pretty good job here Lucas Beauchamp is exactly the way I pictured him in the book as is Chick What the movie couldnt really go into was how Beauchamp wasnt liked by the Negro people either because he was equally as stubborn Not that it is a bad thing but from my take on the book that was his attitude toward the world yet I got the feeling it was white societys racism that started it and it spilled over into Negro society until that became his attitude toward everyonebr br the best part of the movie is that you get to see Yoknapatawpha county actually Oxford Mississippi exactly as Faulkner wrote about it the film was made when Faulkner was alive and writing It doesnt look that much different today Because of this alone the movie is worth a watch considering it is filmed in Faulkners backyard A true must see for Faulkner fans,positive

Having read the comments on the site I feel compelled to write in for the first time It seems this movie is like Marmite and has split the audience I have to say that while I agree films dont have to make sense to be enjoyable see MULHOLLAND DRIVE they still have to engage you with the characters Now while I was totally absorbed by the murderous lesbian affair in Lynchs opus I have to say I couldnt give a turd about Mr Green or the other cardboard gangsters that inhabited this dayglo world br br Also while so many people seem to try and say you didnt enjoy because you didnt get it I would have to disagree  I didnt enjoy because I was bored I wanted the film to end and constantly listening to those quotes over and over again did not help Call it clever if you will  I think its repetitiousbr br However my main reason for writing is to ask all the other reviewers a question  there were no end credits on the print of the film I saw Just music over black Did I watch a dud print or is this evidence of GRs pretentiousness Or did everyone involved in the movie watch the rough cut and have their name removed,negative
I am a huge Randolph Scott fan so I was surprised and disappointed to find he is barely in this film The movie really belongs to Robert Ryan who is the hero in the jam and the one embroiled in the love triangle Good grief Gabby Hayes gets more screen time than Mr Scott in this movie For many viewers that is not a problem but I am from the Walter Brennan school of sidekicks not Gabby Hayesalthough I will say that his lines were a bit more humorous than annoying in this film than in many of his films with Randolph Scott and John Waynebr br Personally I found the movie very slow going with a convoluted plot that was muddied even more by the unnecessary romance subplot By convoluted I dont mean impossible to understand or figure out I just mean too messy for its own goodbr br The direction is uninspired and the two main bad guys have the most unsatisfying comeuppance at the end The whole movie comes across as fake unrealistic and poorly filmedbr br Just so you dont think I cant find anything good herebr br On the plus side Anne Jeffreys is very sexy in her alltoobrief parts of this film Not sure if it is actually her singing or someone else but whoever it was had a very pretty voice Ms Jeffreys also had a couple of nice acting moments The script needed either a lot more of her or to remove her character altogether As it was her nice few moments werent enough to help the filmbr br Lastly there is Mr Scott He looks fantastic in this film and is the nononsense lawman out to set things right Some folks complain that his characters prior to 1950 were too goodygoody perfect but thats never bothered me at all Ill take him goodygoody pre1950 or gritty and violent post1950either way Randolph Scott was a real Western herobr br It saddens me to have to say it but I would have to recommend passing this film by unless you are a diehard fanthere are so many better Scott films out there that this one wont be missed,negative

Redo the Oscars from 1992 and this film might get nominated or even win It was SO good at capturing its era and dual cultures that it belongs in American and Japanese time capsules If you wanted to know what living here or there was like back then this film will show you As an American youll feel like you tagged along for an extended Japanese vacation and by the end of the film youll be a diehard Dragons fan as you accept the injection of Japanese tradition and culture into their baseball much as we have done with our culture in our own gamebr br Jack Elliot Tom Selleck is a slumping aging Detroit Tigers slugger who is traded to the Dragons perennial runnersup to the dynastic Yomuri Giants Japans answer to the Yankees The Giants are admired for their success yet that success also has everyone wanting to surpass them something which is rarely done The Dragons manager recruits Jack as the final piece of the pennantwinning puzzle and were left with what could have been Gung Ho on a baseball field but instead was much morebr br The casting was outstanding Selleck proved that with a good script and a character that suits him he can carry a film as well as he did his television show and the Japanese cast was equally good down to Mr Takagi from Die Hard back as the imageconscious owner The other actors including the one who plays the love interest also the managers daughter strong and independent yet simultaneously a believer in Japanese traditions beyond what was forced on her She is a proper and supportive girlfriend for Jack Even her father never tells her not to see him almost sympathizing with Jack for what he endures from her and a bit relieved he at least knows the man she has chosen to lovebr br The baseball scenes are great bolstered immensely by a prefame Dennis Haysbert as another American expatriate and Jacks western mentor The usual fishoutofwater elements are there and you can almost feel yourself stumbling right along with Jack to fit into a country that doesnt speak our language and doesnt practice our ways yet copies everything we do including our national pastime one of the funnier scenes occurs when Jack clutching a magazine informs his manager that he has learned of the tradition in Japan where you can get drunk and tell off your boss and it cant be used against you and exercises that right very humorously The plots and subplots are tied up neatly at the end but not too neatly and nothing concludes unrealisticallybr br To call this a comedy is misguided its a pure comedydrama or even a drama with good humor The plot is too deep to dismiss it the way it was by critics as an actor out of his league trying to carry a lightweight film The situations were amusing but in their place against a far more serious profound and precisely detailed backdrop that results in one of the best films Ive ever seen The baseball cinematography rivals that of For Love Of The Game for realismbr br Some say the film is about baseball or about Japan but more than anything it seems to be about the workplace and how people arrive at work from totally different origins with different agendas and somehow have to put their differences aside for the good of the company or the teambr br A truly great film that never should have had to apologize for itself the way it did when it was in theaters,positive
Jennifer Montgomerys Art for Teachers of Children is a stunning disturbing masterpiece Montgomerys gritty camerawork and cinematography coupled with the brilliantly unemotional performances she evokes from her cast heighten the sense of shocking raw realism in this autobiographical story of a 14yearold Jennifers seduction of her married boardingschool guidance counselor The scenes between the amazingly uncanny actress playing Jennifer Caitlin Grace McDonnell and Jennifers mother actually voiced by Ruth Montgomery on the phone are some of the most intriguing and powerful Ive ever seen captured on film The lesson ultimately learned here Theres nothing more dangerous than a boring man who creates bad art Well I would highly recommend this remarkable piece of Art for anyone interested in thoughtprovoking independent cinema,positive

The Hindi version of the film is 121 minutes Set in Bengal in the early 1900s the film based on Tagores novel draws an analogy between the British colonization of India and the subjugation of women An educated and beautiful woman Binodini becomes a widow within a year of her marriage but she does not accept the constraints imposed on her as a widow by her society The film has a beautiful look to it but perhaps Aishwarya Rai is out of her depth in portraying Binodinis strong character with its subtle combination of idealism and deviousness Binodinis idealism does not come across and as a result the analogy between women and colonization remains somewhat buried,positive

one of those actors who always looks like he must have been a Doctor Who around the time noone was watching it anymore hamming up the blasé public school macho in the hope that noone will ever see it and the peerless reaction shots of John Hallam as the male nurse who keeps on opening the door midpsychictornado to bring in more drugs As if they needed any more in this film Its just a shame that Frank Finlays madhaired scientist who isnt qualified to certify death on alien life forms a role originally intended for Klaus Kinski missed out on the action in that onebr br No matter how mad you

naked Mathilda May or the space vampires turning St Pauls Cathedral into the worlds biggest lasershow to transport human souls from the London Underground to their geostationary mother ship I loved every gloriously insane moment In its own truly unique way this might be the greatest film ever madebr br The DVD offers the original 116minute version that opened in the UK rather than the heavily edited 101minute US version which not only offers much more hilarity for your dollar but also fully restores Henry Mancinis score to its original glory the US version covered a lot of the gaps with additional cues by Michael Kamen and James Guthrie Although a somewhat surprising choice at first sight Mancini cut his teeth on many of the classic Universal scifi horrors of the 50s and his score is quite superb with a terrific driving main title that offers a rare reminder of just how interesting he could be away from Blake Edwards Sadly theres no more than a trailer by way of extras though it would be nice to hope some day for a special edition with some of the deleted scenes from Hoopers originally intended 128minute cut from whats on display here these might just offer even more comedy

Firstly let me get this of my chest I hate Octopussy with an absolute passion What is so frustrating is that it had so much potential and had a very good opening sequence unfortunately post the opening sequence it all goes downhill Firstly there was absolutely no plot to begin with just an excuse for Moore to tell his corny jokes Next there are several sequences that would make a Bond fan cringefor instance the sequence in which Bond turns up to diffuse a bomb dressed as a clown The villains are pretty poor Louis Jordon fails to make an impact as Kamal Khan and Bollywood veteran Kabir Bedi is equally poor as his henchman Its funny that when people debate over what the worst Bond movie is and Octopussy gets overlooked when it can easily give them a run for their money,negative
This movie was pretty good The acting was great and there were some really great actors in it like Buchholz and Roger Moore This film is full of surprises Confusing at timesyes but the twists and turns of the plot always keeps you in suspense The only thing that this movie had too much of was exploding cars,positive
BSG is one of my all time favourite TV series I was lucky enough to start watching it as the series came to its final season It was a marathon from start to finish for me and what an incredible ride it was br br As soon as I noticed the pilot on Hulu I knew exactly what I was in for just by the title  Caprica Although some things dont add up when you compare both series it is still beautifully executed There were no mention about the holobands in Battlestar Galactica or the mention of virtual worlds but maybe I havent got far enough into the series for them to explain whybr br I recommend this show to anyone who loves the universe technology and alternate fantasies of our world This show is very interesting and will have you wanting to watch more,positive

William Faulkner was one of the American writers to win the Nobel Prize in literature Faulkner mostly wrote about life in the South particularly during the depression years Many of his stories have been adapted to screen Short stories like Two Soldiers is an endearing tale of two brothers in December 1941 after the attack on Pearl Harbor The older brother Pete Greer goes to Memphis Tennessee to enlist like hundreds of thousands of young men some who would never come home His younger brother doesnt take his departure well He manages to get a bus ticket to Memphis without any money to find his brother He surprisingly becomes a soldier of another kind since he wants to enlist also at 10 years old Ron Perlman does a surprising performance as the military leader who manages to take care and bond with the boy This short film won an Oscar for Best ShortLive Action film which is welldeserved If it was longer it could compete with the longer films Everything else like costumes art direction and recreating the era of America in 1941 is perfect The film also shows the heartbreaking war at home as most Americans were surviving the great depression The actors and actresses are not known but they do a first rate performances If Hollywood would make more quality films I would probably go to the cinema more If Broadway had more quality shows I would go to the theater more,positive

Everybody who wants to be an editor should watch this movie It shows you about every mistake not to do in editing a movie My grandma could have done better than that But thats not the only reason why this movie is really bad Its actually so bad that Im not able to write a sentence without exclamation mark If the first episode of Les Visiteurs was a quite good familial comedy with funny jokes and cult dialogues this sequel is copying badly the receipe of the first one The funny parts could be counted on one hand and maybe half of it Clavier is overacting his role even more than in the first part Robin is trying to act like Lemercier because shes replacing her but thats grotesque Lemercier is Lemercier Robin is Robin Even if Muriel Robin can be funny by herself on stage she is not in this movie because shes not acting as she used to act I know that it should be hard to replace somebody who was good in a role Lemercier obtained a César award for her role in the first movie but she made a big mistake instead of playing her role she played Lemercier playing her role As for the story its just too much Of course we knew at he end of the first movie that there would be a sequel but Poiré and Clavier should hae tried to write a more simple story like the first episode The gags are repetitive childish and déjàvu No really theres no more than 3 funny parts in this The only good things might be the costumes and some special effects So you have only 2 reasons to watch it 1 if you want to learn how to edit awfully a movie 2 if you want to waste your time or if you really need a brainless moment 210,negative

When I heard about Hammerhead being released on DVD and finally found it at my local DVD store I thought well just another cheap monster movie from Nu Image Those guys around Boaz Davidson and Avi Lerner produced cheap but very entertaining B  Pictures in the past few months but also some very disappointing movies So I didnt expect much especially after having watched the rather disappointing Shark Zone just a few days before But Hammerhead turned out to be an excellent revival of the 1950s monster movies We have a mad scientist a group of people in a dangerous situation screaming women and damsels in distress maneating plants and of course we have the creature a huge mutant mix between a man and a hammerhead shark Everything you need for an entertaining monster movie The only thing missing are graphic sex scenes and nudity which you expect in movies of this kind but since the movie was made for TV its understandable why these scenes are missing And it doesnt matter anyway cause Hammerhead is action and horror entertainment at its best There are two reasons why I gave it seven out of ten points though First of all the monster isnt seen very often and the showdown with the destruction of the creature is too fast and poorly done and secondly William Forsythe just isnt the right guy for the hero part and for falling in love with gorgeous Hunter Tylo Other than that I can highly recommend this movie for any monster movie fan out there Grab yourselves a cool drink and some popcorn watch this movie and have fun Jasper P Morgan,positive
The acting other reviews notwithstanding was remarkably welldone Brad Pitt handles the role of an annoying obnoxious Austrian climber quite well Other acting is fine The story could have been riveting but somehow it misses  one never really understands or cares for the characters shown and so the story which could have been quite dramatic fails to draw in this audiencebr br Beautiful scenery and cinematography a remarkably dramatic true story important events that shaped the world that we live in  but I could not try as I might involve myself in this story As an unabashed Brad Pitt fan I consider him one of the top 5 actors of his generation I expected to love this flick  and yet it left me coldbr br It could be a failing within myself but I tend to point toward the creative end of this movie  direction scriptwriting production editing  somehow they lost me Its a shame because it could have been wonderfulbr br Good acting dramatic story beautifully shot  it should have been magnificent It wasnt Probably worth watching just to make your own mind up on it  but dont expect too much and perhaps you wont be as disappointed as I was Mostly it bored me,negative
Believe it or not at 12 minutes this film for 1912 is a fulllength film Very very few films were longer than that back then but that is definitely NOT what sets this odd little film apart from the rest No whats different is that all the actors with the exception of one frog are bugsyes bugs This simple little domestic comedy could have looked much like productions starring the likes of Chaplin Laurel and Hardy or Max Linder but instead this Russian production uses bugs or I think models that looked just like bugs Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy were yet to be discovered and I assume Linder was busy so perhaps thats why they used bugs Using stopmotion the bugs moved and danced and fought amazingly welland a heck of a lot more realistically than King Kong 21 years later br br The film starts with Mr Beetle sneaking off for a good time He goes to a bawdy club while his wife supposedly waits at home But unfortunately for Mr Beetle he is caught on camera by a local film buff Plus he doesnt know it but Mrs Beetle is also carrying on with a bohemian grasshopper painter Of course theres a lot more to this domestic comedy than this but the plot is ageold and very entertaining for adults and kids alikebr br Weird but also very amazing and watchable,positive
Ok so its an adult movie But it really is very tastefully done Its obvious that the producers spent a lot of time and money into making a classy sort of movie I was pleasantly surprised at just how good it was Even the acting was fairly decent The plot was more solid than most adult films Ive seen The camera work was above average Its just a good flick,positive
After I got done watching this movie I was so upset that I had wasted 2 hours of my life Thats 2 hours Ill never get back Ugh When you start this you might think Wow this is really good But rest assured that first impressions mean NOTHING I was so excited about this movie until the dumbest ending I have ever seen This movie is simply pathetic The acting is bland the story line is anything but original and theres nothing especially unique about this except that its the WORST MOVIE EVER DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE WARNING DUMBEST MOVIE EVER YOU WILL BE SORRY IF YOU WASTE 2 HOURS OF YOUR LIFE ON THIS 110,negative
This is far worse than those awful Laurel and Hardy cartoons of the 60s They were terrible but at least they were simple ripoffs of a then Stan and Ollie resurgence New audiences had rediscovered the pairs comedic genius and the cartoons were mindnumbing garbage geared to cash in on childrens interest It was to be expected But how does one even attempt to rationalize this work of I cant even think of a word Im sure the makers hoped it would somehow inspire another Laurel and Hardy revival but you cant inspire interest in the past with a shallow and unfunny caricature of what made the original so appealing The impressionists I hesitate to call them actors do a Vegas act and thats where it belongs The plot is even flimsier than those used in the old days trying to stretch out tworeel ideas for a feature If this film was someones first exposure to the REAL Laurel and Hardy Im sure that viewer would dismiss the original duos reputation as senility gone amok The only movie I hate worse than this is I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE And you know these filmmmakers basically did the same thing to Stan and Ollie,negative
yes i have a copy of it on VHS uncut in great condition that i transfered to DVD and if anyone one wants to bring back the memories of a Christmas classic please emil me at dmd2222verizonneti searched everywhere and i found nothing on this and i thought that i cant be the only one on this planet that has this classic on tape there has to be other people and if they do i fit in with them being that very very few that has this classic so i consider myself lucky and i have all of the muppets Christmas except one that john denver did with the muppets again i thinks its called a smokey mountain holiday im not to sure but its close,positive
I really loved this movie I thought it was very well done The character interaction was wonderfully done as was the characterization The actors were definitely believable The plot was very deep and intriguing Even though parts of it are a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring its definitely worth watching several times The chemistry between the three main actors was great If you dont want to watch it for that then at least watch it for the drama between the characters I mean the whole thing was just Whoa It was like I couldnt look away The whole movie grabbed my attention and kept my interest even through the slow parts I loved this movie and almost everything about it I loved the ending because it was so interesting and if you watch the movie a second time makes perfect sense But Im not spoiling anything,positive
i dont know why but after all the hype on NPR i thought this was a new movieall the best footage has been used for BBC docs and NatGeo projects that you have seen if you are interested in nature programsit has been repackaged with sappy narration and overdramatic music for Disney to take advantage of Earth Daythere are great moments and it is always nice to listen to Darth Vaderoops James Earl Jones speak but I had hoped for a ground breaking movie  considering the new camera technology used in the making of this filmit has been sanitized for a child audience so one can actually see better footage for free on youtube i feel that we are due for something as ground breaking as Koyannisquatsi sic and this movie is certainly not it,negative
Although inevitably linked to the 70s decade the concept of exploitationcinema is actually nearly as old as cinema itself Moreover Universal Studios practically invented the term with their long running monster cycles Dracula Frankenstein The Wolf Man and The Mummy Every original classic spawned a couple of sequels at least and after a while they even thought up the idea of making genuine monster stewing House of Frankenstein released one year earlier and also directed by Erle C Kenton was quite a successful effort with interesting ideas and enthusiast performances but House of Dracula is a little too loony for me to recommend it The plot suffers too much from extremely irritating coincidental situations forced twists  dialogs and  most of all  a far too short running time to elaborate the monsters personalities like they deserve Onslow Stevens doesnt receive top billing but plays the most fundamental role as miracle a doctor whos challenged to cure Count Dracula Carradine from his incontrollable thirst for blood and fix Lawrence Talbots illness of mutating into a hairy Wolf Man whenever the moon is full During a nightly walk in some caves they also pick up the remainders of Frankensteins monster and the good doctor himself eventually undergoes a JekyllHyde metamorphosis due to a bad blood transfusion The last invitation to the messy party is a female hunchback though not of the Notre Dame Something is very wrong when youre watching a movie that is literally stuffed with horror icons yet the only character in the whole movie that is able to freak you out is an ordinary villager going by the name Siegfried The actual monsters are dull and their oncefabulous backgrounds are fully drained Count Dracula is a whining romanticist Talbot is a pitiable and also whining old martyr and the Frankenstein creation  well his share in the plot isnt even worth mentioning Theres a serious lack of atmospheric settings and nifty photography in this Universal film especially compared to all their other efforts and the abrupt climax is a disaster,negative
I was fortunate enough to record this wonderful drama both parts when it originally aired on Masterpiece Theatre I loved it but lost it Then one day while going through old tapes found it again I recorded it to DVD and watched and  WOW I still love it The leads are excellent and my only complaint is I wish we had seen more Kester What a man And Prue Shes so strong and wonderful  living in a time and age where her affliction and how she deals with it is seen as unfortunate and evil Even her own brother tells Prue to her face that he doubts that a man will ever have her sigh Unfortunately my copy is not the greatest with wear and tear over the years and I too would absolutely love to own this on professional DVD if it ever happens,positive
This could have been great The voiceovers are exactly right and fit the characters to a T One small problem though the look of the characters mostly the supporting or guest characters look exactly the same The same bored look on every face only with minor changes such as hairlines or weight size It looks kind of odd to see a really big guest stars voice coming out of a lifeless form like the characters here If I am not mistaken Kathy Griffin did a voiceover for this show and it looked too odd to be funnybr br There is a few other problems one being the family plot The Simpsons did it much better where you could actually buy most of the situations the characters got themselves into Here we get too much annoying diversions like someone having a weird fantasy and then we are supposed to find that funny but for some reason the delivery is a bit off As you can probably tell it is hard for me to put a finger on exactly what is wrong with this show because it basically nothing more than a clone of the Simpsons or even more Married with Childrenbr br If I should point a finger on what is totally wrong with this it probably is its repetitiveness Peter Griffin is not really a bright character but neither are any of the others Lois should have been named Lois Lame because she is sort of onedimensional Seth Green as the kind of retarded son is the best thing about this show and that is the most stereotypical part on the showbr br So what more can I say There isnt exactly anything wrong with this show but in the long run you have to admit that it takes a lot of work to do what the Simpsons has done for almost two decades,negative
A delightful story about two evacuees has been turned into a nice little film by the BBC Most children who like a good story will enjoy this The characters are played really well by a very good cast Not sure whether our American friends will appreciate it but they do get a mention as Aunty Lou runs off with a gorgeous American soldier,positive

This film should be called adventures in Cinemascope It is like the screenwriter and director tooks the Cliffs Notes page 3 outline and decided that this would be a great vehicle for a film about the Italian Alps Rock Hudson is pretty good here but the dialogue bears no resemblance to Hemingway at all This is a made up version of Hemingway Hecht the screenwriter is a hack Watch the 1932 version with Gary Cooper and Helen Hayes That is great cinema and was made by someone who understood Hemingway and the war in Northern Italy Gary Cooper is very very good compared to his performance in For Whom the Bell Tolls where he is stiff as a board and thinks he is in a westernbr br Anyway if you are a Hemingway fan do yourself a favor and do not watch this film Your best bet is to get the unabridged audio CD and just listen to one of the greatest novels ever written,negative
I go to the movies to be entertained I was very entertained by the first film in this series The DaVinci Code It had plenty of twists and turns throughout to keep me very interested Angels and Demons is no different If you enjoyed the DaVinci Code then you will undoubtedly enjoy this movie as well Angels and Demons is made pretty much with the exact same style as the previous film but faster paced which I liked Ron Howard kept me glued to my seat for the full two hours without boring me one bitbr br What I really liked about this movie was that even though it is obviously fictitious they leave enough real history to make it seem very believable If there is one thing that I didnt like about this movie it is that the plot itself is very unbelievable dont want to give any spoilers But hey its a movie I was entertained throughout the whole thing and was very satisfied with what I saw,positive

The storyline of The Thief of Bagdad is complex owing to its being told in flashbacks and having three separate and equally important strands woven together The screenplay by Lajo Biros and the dialogue by Miles Malleson keep the story moving skillfully at all pointsThe young King Ahmad of Bagdad is angry at his vizier Jaffar for executing a man for having different ideas He discovers while in disguise that people blame him for Jaffars deeds and hate him He is imprisoned by Jaffar where he meets Abu the young thief The two escape and take a boat to the city of Basra There the companions spy when men clear the way so none will see the Princess of the city passing by Ahmad falls in love with her and visits her in her garden He tells her he has come to her from beyond time and wins a kiss Then he is captured When Jaffar comes to win the Princess of Basra for himself Ahmad attacks the evil vizier who blinds him and turns Abu into a dog Jaffar then asks for the Princesss hand and he gives the gift of a mechanical flying horse to the Sultan of Basra The blind Ahmad then tells his tale in the marketplace accompanied by Abu as his dog The Prince has fallen into a sleep and nothing can wake her So Jaffar sends his servant Halima for Ahmad and the dog in hopes the prince can rouse her He does awaken her She boards a ship to find a doctor to cure Ahmad but she is captured by Jaffar who then throws the dog overboard She then allows Jaffar to take her in his arms on his promise to restore Ahmads sight and turn Abu back into a thief The princess sees a vision of Ahmad he is in a boat Jaffar sends a storm to beset him and Abu is shipwrecked on a deserted island Abu finds a genie or djinn who wants to kill him now that he is free after many centuries spent imprisoned in a bottle Abu tricks him into proving he really came from so small a vessel then corks him in again For freeing him he gets three wishes His first is for sausages In the meanwhile the Princess pleads with her father to refuse Jaffar but Jaffar shows the Sultan a new mechanical toy one of whose six arms stabs him to death Abu makes a second wish to find Ahmad The cunning genie flies him to the goddess of the AllSeeing eye Abu has to climb a great web to get to the gem that is the eye battling a giant spider then scaling the goddesss statue Abu gazes into the eye and sees Ahmad in a canyon He has the genie take him to Ahmad Ahmad uses the eye to see the princess She smells a flower and forgets everything at once Abu wishes they were in Bagdad but the genie laughs and leaves Jaffar tells the Princess that she is in love with him omitting mention of Ahmad Ahmad tries to fight his way to the Princess but Jaffar smashes the eye Abu finds himself in the Land of Legend where the old men who rule want to make him their king He steals a bow and a magic carpet and escapes instead to hurry to save Ahmad and the princess The thief arrives in time to save the young king from the executioner using his bow from the flying carpet to the wonder of the throng who had come to watch the execution Jaffar tries to flee on the mechanical flying horse but another shot from the bow finishes him Ahmad is ruler again and plans to wed his Princess but when he tries to make Abu his vizier the young thief refuses saying that what he wants is adventure not hard work and confinement in a palace however grand it may be This fantastic story was given a sumptuous production by producer Alexander Korda The production was designed by Vincent Korda who was also art director while Georges Perinal did the colorful cinematography The directors credited are Ludwig Berger and Michael Powell with Tim Whelan Alexander Korda William Cameron Menzies and Zoltan Korda participating The extraordinary and numerous costumes designs were the work of John Armstrong Oliver Messel and Marcel Vertes The production apart from its gorgeous and expensivelooking visual splendors I claim is dominated by two other elements the choral music of Miklos Rozsa and the performance by Conrad Veidt as the evil Jaffar Rex Ingram plays the genie with a curious accent plus his usual intelligence and power June Duprez is lovely and effective as the Princess Mary Morris is a sad and beautiful Halima and Miles Malleson a properly bumbling and avaricious Sultan As Ahmad John Justin appears to do most of what can be done with the part of a young prince in love and then some he is memorably good in his winning role This film has a spaciousness about it that is found I assert in other Korda works also Its imaginative content stands in contrast to verystrong realistic sets costumes and setdesign elements This is one of the most memorable idealevel fantasies of all time worthy to be enjoyed over and over,positive
A text prologue warns us that we should not allow evil to enter our house but I think the more apt word is entropy Good grief what slobs these two babes arebr br George Seymour Cassell is alone in his San Francisco office and his monstrously expensive home in Tiburon while his wife and child are away in San Diego Two girls Sondra Locke as Jackson and Colleen Camp as Donna knock on his door asking directions Well its raining and theyre shivering like two drenched pitiful kittens and theyre not sure of the address theyre looking for and what with one thing and another George invites them to come in and partake of his pizza by the fire All three of them wind up in Georges bath tub and there follows about five minutes of mostly undifferentiated nudity in double exposure triple exposure quadruple exposure and dodekakuple exposure They spend the night in a threesome and the next morning the girls fix him breakfast But something has gotten slightly cockeyed because Georgies guests gobble everything down with their fingers and pour ketchup and syrup all over the linen and  You eat like ANIMALS George exclaims and tells them to get out In his dreams br br Now dont get me wrong Sondra Locke is an extraordinary looking young blond with cobaltblue eyes and Colleen Camp bounces around like a superball You gotta say they breed em mighty cute down there in Shelbyville Tennessee where Locke comes from and they breed em with bodacious tushes too as we cant help but note after the first five or ten minutesbr br But when the girls go berserk so does the movie The film is thereafter bathed in a garish green light The pair put on ghoulish makeup and make gargoyle faces at themselves in the mirrors They brain a delivery boy and then drown him to make sure They cuss up a storm and smash windows and furniture They have one of those scenes in which two people sit across the table from one another licking food and then jumping each others bones br br And Georgie They first render Georgie unconscious with mace which contains nothing that you cant find in that little red bottle of McIlhenys Tabasco sauce in your kitchen cabinet tie him up pour flour and milk all over him subject him to a psychotic trial put him through one of those Tolstoytype semiexecutions slap him around dress up in outlandish costumes then prance out on him and his virtually destroyed uppermiddleclass home and are dispatched by a delivery van ex machinabr br As for the acting its as if someone had told Georgie First act polite to these girls then act panicked after youre tied up And to the girls First act shy unwilling to impose on anyone then act crazy And thats it br br The photography and location work are straight out of a 1970s porn movie Im not sure that suggests a total lack of skill It takes effort and talent to turn San Francisco ugly The score gives us two Leitmotivs Georgies is some pop tune with lyrics about being free and giving in Jackson and Donnas is a catchy rinkytink thing called My Good Old Dad br br I approve of the moral lesson behind the story though There are some things you should simply not give in to even though they might look like a lot of fun at first All very educational,negative
For the uninitiated almost any Andy Milligan film is a shock but despite the fact that Ive seen many of his films this one still takes the cake for sheer shoddinessbr br This is of course Milligans take on the Sweeney Todd tale done with period costumes but not necessarily period hairstyles in some cases and the usual headacheinducing camerawork  grainy quality As for the gore well the version I saw may have been cut some for theres not a lot for a film with bloodthirsty in the title The best indication of subversive filmmaking here is a meat pie consisting only of some poor victims titbr br So while I will still treasure this piece of uh work on my video shelf its definitely somewhat of a letdown as far as content though Recommended for only the foolhardy  morbidly curious 3 out of 10,negative
Acolytes presents an interesting mix of original concepts in screaming teen cliché horror with a more thrillerlike pacing In some ways Acolytes is very successful but in many other ways the film fails miserablybr br Overall Acolytes avoided the typical archetypes of the naivety and innocence of youth of endless horror films in the like of Cabin Fever Texas Chainsaw Massacre and countless other films where unsuspecting and relatively naive and innocent teenagers have sex run around screaming and onebyone are plucked off by some sort of monster Instead this innocence is replaced with pride retaliation and arrogance The characters had several opportunities to save themselves from immanent death and despair but failed to do so due to their own personal demons In the end you were left with the feeling that there were no and perhaps are no innocent victimsbr br As the name implies the film also touches greatly on following a leader or authority This was used in a direct sense of if the main character would become like the serial killer and was also used less directly throughout the film Following a central figure is a reoccurring theme throughout the filmbr br Through all this the film makers also incorporated a lot of cliché which I suspect was intentional and gave the film a unique mixture of depth as well as shallowness which I found intriguing This perhaps inadvertently plays well with the characters who are at first appearance very shallow but as the story unfolds it becomes obvious that they are at least the two main male characters quite complexbr br Technically the film has a lot of problems however The cinematography which is typically regarded highly I find rather sophomoric and overstylized utilizing formulaic 23 approaches far too rigidly Many transitions I felt were also overstylized The use of symbolism was not only vague but also greatly over usedbr br The plot was poorly planned and relied exclusively on misinformation in order to achieve a rather hokey twist ending which was poorly resolved and leaves viewers confused Methods used to resolve the climax are cheap and illprepared motivations are routinely unclear and major plot points remain untied in the endbr br Overall the films relative originality themes and thesis are lost in a maze of poor technical execution overstylized imagery unclear motives obtuse and unnecessary symbolism and cheap twists maintained only by a lack of or entirely incorrect informationbr br If the film were better executed it would have been excellent However Acolytes receives only two stars in my opinion,negative
This must be one of the worse movies that I have ever seen On a par with Blair Witch and just as annoying The flashing helmet lights made things difficult to see and I think that epileptics should take heed as there are moments with strobing that makes this movie even more annoying I think if they had been quieter they might have found a way out Then when you think the geek might come up trumps even he resorts to a nervous breakdown Oh and when is the guy who is having sex realise that when the girl says she can hear something She Can Really Hear Something One of these guys must have at least seen Scream where they draw your attention to such things It is also a big letdown when a premise offers so much promise and then someone writes the script So sorry folks I got this on weekly at the video shop and I would still like my money back,negative
The first episode of this new show was on today and it was horrible Not only did Shaggy have a squeaky new voice that made listening to his lines torture but its so far away from the original concept and animation style that its barely recognizable as a ScoobyDoo showbr br Even back in the dark days when Fred and Velma were gone and Scoobys nephew Scrappy was there the team still solved mysteries This new show instead features Shaggy and Scooby battling a James Bond type supervillain and his henchmen while living in a mansion Theres not even a van called The Mystery Machine and the teaser for the next episode which promised a transformers type robot car did NOT put my mind at ease How can anyone take Scooby Doo and make THIS br br The show earns two point for two scenes featuring the whole Scooby Doo gang all of whom speak with the correct voices except Shaggy and even then Im being far too generous,negative
Wellnow that I know where Rob Zombie stole the title for his House of 1000 Corpses crapfest I can now rest in peace Nothing about the somnambulant performances or trite script would raise the dead in The House of Seven Corpses but a groovie ghoulie comes up from his plot ha anyway to kill the bloody amateurs making a lowrent horror flick in his former abode In Hell House sorry I dont remember the actual name of the residence a bunch of mysterious unexplained deaths took place long ago some like arthritic Lurch standin John Carradine whose small role provides the films only worthwhile moments attribute it to the supernatural bellowing film director John Ireland dismisses it as superstitious hokum The result comes across like Satans School for Girls catchy title madeforTV production values intriguing plot crossed with Children Shouldnt Play With Dead Things lowrent movie about lowrent movie makers who wake the dead trouble is its nowhere near as entertaining or fun The House of Seven Corpses is dead at frame one and spends the rest of its 89 minutes going through rigor mortis dragging us along for every aching second,negative
This is an extraordinary film musically It made me feel awful that Rodrigues died in 1999 before I had a chance to see her live To know that she performed a marvelous Lincoln Ctr concert in 1991  that I mightve been there but wasnt is painful beyond wordsbr br I just purchased my first Amalia recording While the musical recording is fantastic being able in this film to SEE her face  its tremendous expressiveness  passion as she sings these songs of terrible sadness is wonderful Sort of like seeing the face of Mary as she cradles Jesus in her arms in the Pieta Watching her on film reminded me of being witness to a similar extraordinary concert performance by Mercedes Sosa in the mid 1990s at Lincoln Ctr As I sat listening to Mercedes sing I felt I was in the presence of a tremendous spiritual  musical force that contained awesome primal power Some of The Art of Amalias musical segments are touching such as Caetano Veloso paying tribute to Amalia  singing one of her songs solo in front of a packed concert hall The musical segments also convey the incredible international sweep of her musical repertoire  the bonds she created w fans throughout the entire world There is one segment in which she claims that she has played in every single town in Italy that has a stagebr br In another section Amalia talks about her bout w mouth cancer  how she came to NYC to commit suicide in a hotel Yet through watching Fred Astaire film videos she gradually persuaded herself that life was worth living  turned away from killing herself Amazing Later in the film she quite bravely  directly admits to the interviewer that though she mightve conquered the world musically her personal life was one of pure sadness She admits that she has never been happy This is unbearably sad to hear but perfectly in keeping w a singer steeped in the fado which she translates as bad destiny or bad luck tradition Also one longs to hear more about her personal life what was in that made her so sad what were her disappointmentsbr br The Art of Amalia is a little disappointing in other major areas My quibbles to show 2030 full songs in the film yet to only provide an English translation for the very last one seems a waste unless the film was only intended for a Portuguese speaking audience which I cant imagine To see the profound pain on her face as she sings  not to understand the lyrics is a let down As for the other minuses there is almost no biographical material about Amalias family background There is one 20 sec snippet w her singing w her mother its absolutely grand There is one short reference to her parents moving fr the countryside to Lisbon I wouldve loved to see film footage of the village she came from The interviews such as they are are almost solely w Amalia herself  a few close friends She is a good but not great subject There are no interview subjects who are experts on fado or Portuguese culture  society so we get no depth of understanding of her musical rootsbr br In short this is a wonderful film that everyone interested in Amalia should see But its not a perfect or definitive work on the subject,positive
From the beginning of this filmwith its The Lost boys rip off opening sequence to the bad wire work and even worse dialog ending this movie slimed along at a snails pace The Covenant came highly recommended from some of my coworkers who I am thoroughly convinced were playing a practical joke on me At least I hope that was the intention and their taste isnt that bad This movie was not much longer than an hour and a half yet felt much much longer then that The story was so basic that it could have been summed up in about 15 minutes maximum They could have at least filled the rest of the movie with some entertaining magic or fight scenes however someone decidedmaybe the director but I dont know if anyone really directed this movie that it was going to be filled with some poorly executed artsy camera shots and nonsensical scenes of the boys swimming and getting into bar fights About half way through this film I thought that maybe bashing my head against a wall would be more entertaining and partially to rid myself of this horrible dirty feeling I had for continuing to watch it  So I did bash my head against a wall and I did enjoy it more then the movie I watched it all the way to the bitter end hoping it would eventually offer me more enjoyment Nopemy efforts were rewarded with How about I make you my Wheeaytch I vomited and then just felt embarrassment for the screen writer and pity for the poor actor who had to deliver this drivel The acting really wasnt as bad as other reviewers seemed to think but even the most talented thespian could not saved this work and work it did on my nerves I give movies a chance even bad ones because they usually offer some form of enjoyment and this actually wasnt the worst movie I have ever seen After it was over I did feel like watching the movie Stealth again and WOW it was so much better this time around Oh yeah Case in point dont bother with this movie really dont Watch a few episodes of Charmed and watch The Lost boys after having a fair amount of alcohol and you will be a much better person If you do fall into the same trap that I did and watch The Covenant make sure to keep all sharp objects far far away from yourself youll thank me for it,negative
