21,It is a great tragedy that both Richard Harris and John Derek are no longer with us But that shouldnt blind anybody to the fact that in 1981 a pretty ugly blotch appears on both mens CVs No doubt John Derek conceived this movie doing for his wife what Some Like it Hot and One Million Years BC did for Maryln Monroe and Raquel Welsh respectively creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade Having run to embrace Dudley Moore on the beach in 10 Bos reputation an allstar cast and location filming in Sri Lanka meant that nothing could go wrong Alas as they say Mortals plan and God laughs It is said that when this film premiered in 1981 the Edgar Rice Burrows estate tried to take legal action against it Bo Derek plays Jane Parker who sets off into turnofthe century Africa to be reunited with her boozy abusive Dad Richard Harris Daddy Parker is an explorer who has set out to find the Great Inland Sea the stuff of local legend whose existence has been poopooed by conventional wisdom Harris is worth watching for a wonderfully hammy tanked up performance which includes singing an Irish ditty at an Indian elephant that somehow found its way into Africa did it arrive at the same time as the OrangUtan from Sumatra Furthermore although Jane professes to despise Parker Bo and Richs relationship is creepily incestuous testimony perhaps to the effects of the tropical heat Before long however local legends start to circulate about a Great White Ape and Jane hears the famous yodel This is the movies cue for Miles OKeefe a future BMovie star making a rather odd debut as the loinclothed Lord of the Jungle Unlike Johnny Weismuller with his pidgin English or Ron Ely who speaks the language fluently the OKeefe Tarzan is mute Given some of Bo and Richies dialog though this is probably not a bad thing Harris and his caravan eventually reaches the Great Inland Sea located atop a gigantic plateau that seems to run halfway across Africahang on arent seas lakes and other watery places generally located in lowlying areas Nevermind it is just one of many anomalies in the John Derek universe The crew attempt to mount the cliffs and when the ropes snap Harris roars echoing abuse at the hapless men who have plummeted to their deaths On another occasion Jane decides to take a nude swim by the Inland Sea giving another occasion to see some gratuitous nudity Out of nowhere a single male lion appears Now lions usually travel in prides and never go near beaches but later on Tarzan will be wrestling with a venomous boa constrictor Zoology doesnt seem to have been one of John Dereks strong points This being a Tarzan movie Jane becomes enchanted with the Lord of the Jungle and resolves to take his virginity But having seen his closeness to some of those chimps you do have to wonderSpeaking of which its not only the Edgar Rice Burroughs estate could have sued It is highly probable that certain primates were on the phone to their lawyers the chimps here make you miss Cheeta badly Especially when they do ridiculous things like ride on the backs of elephants and clap their hands when Tarzan and Jane finally get it on The climax of this film has Bo and Harris captured by some rather stereotypical cannibals who paint our heroine and prepare to sacrificeeatexecute her Suffice is to say that The Great Wooden Ape gets his girl and SPOILER Harris gets himself impaled on a huge elephant tusk This doesnt stop the dying Parker from delivering a rambling monologue to Jane As far as I am aware the law suit from the Rice Burrows estate never materialized but Tarzan the Ape Man was crucified at the box office no kidding A pity John Derek could have directed Tarzan the Ape Man 2 with Bo Derek and Miles OKeefe living in domestic bliss and Dudley Moore as Boy,It is a great tragedy that both Jadeyn Doggett and Brissia Tolliver are no longer with us But that shouldnt blind anybody to the fact that in 1981 a pretty ugly blotch appears on both mens CVs No doubt Malka Millet conceived this movie doing for his wife what Some Like it Hot and One Million Years BC did for Chelby Tavares and Kalib Valenti respectively creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade Having run to embrace Kobi Kennard on the beach in 10 Bos reputation an allstar cast and location filming in Kennewick meant that nothing could go wrong Alas as they say Trenten plan and Tyleah laughs It is said that when this,1,0,0,fail

1606,The Play Macbeth was written by William Shakespeare between the years of 1604 and 1606 Ever since then many other versions of the play have been produced including remakes completed in 1948 1971 and 2006 Akira Kurosawa even directed a Japanese version of Macbeth in 1957 entitled Kumonosu jô The play starts out with King Duncan hearing about the success of two of his generals Macbeth and Banquo in a recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegians After a quick promotion from Duncan Macbeth instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access to the crown even if it includes murderbr  Geoffrey Wright tried creating his own version of the famous play in 2006 by setting it in the modern Melbourne underworld Just imagine a lowly Macbeth slaying hundreds of soldiers with an AK47 and rapping his own rendition of Low at the same time Just kidding about the latter but one thing he does do is utter the traditional Shakespeare And he keeps it going throughout the whole movie Thats right Shakespeare meets ghetto Its all you could ever hope for Not The newest Macbeth is rough and violent enough to match up with any other modern day action film but it lacks decent acting the right lingo and a good technique of camera workbr  The modernized movie starts out with Macbeth Sam Worthington who works as a hit mandrug dealer for Duncan Gary Sweet a drug lord from Melbourne Australia After being promoted to the Thane of Glamis by Duncan as the three witches had predicted aspiration starts to take over Macbeth as he sets his eyes on the throne After promoting Macbeth Duncan invites himself over to Macbeths house for a night of drugs and alcohol Before the festivities begin Lady Macbeth Victoria Hall talks Macbeth into killing Duncan to take power over the throne After the bodyguards are drunk and everyones asleep Macbeth sneaks into Duncans room and stabs him to death After his murder Macbeth takes all of Duncans belongings including hid title and crown Just as soon as he thinks hes got what he wanted he finds out that it will take more than bribery and running away to solve his problems   One major flaw of the movie was the acting A once seemingly flamboyant and empowered Macbeth suddenly turns into a sissy And he looks like a sad puppy dog throughout the entire film I dont really know if this was Worthingtons or Wrights fault but either way one of the two should have realized Macbeth was a king not a knot on a log that took everything his wife had to say literally Like I said earlier Macbeth should have been rude arrogant and spiteful But when his character changes over to a drug lord he changes personalities as well I suppose On the other hand Lady Macbeth really knew how to nip it in the bud when it came to recognizing and personifying her character She didnt seem quite as spiteful as she was in the play or the 1971 version but she reminds Macbeth that compared to murder anything else he could possibly do wouldnt quite match up   Another thing I found distasteful was all the nudity This fluke HAD to be Wrights fault The witches didnt do a bit of acting unless you call parading around in your birthday suit acting At one point in the film I started to wonder if I was watching Macbeth or Unique Positions Vol 2   Dont get me wrong when I say I find the Shakespearean dialogue out of place Its spoken flawlessly but when its spoken by an Australian gangster its just really weird When Macbeth starts to kill people off he first lets them know by talking to them in Ye Olde English Macbeth contains plenty of action blood gore and nudity to last anyone a lifetime You forget all the positive facts though when you start to think to yourself Okay what in the heck did he just say in that last sentence At some points in the movie I dont even think the actors themselves knew what they were saying The new ageness of the movie could have easily been pulled off it werent for the Thous and the Thees   The camera work was just simply fair for me One thing I could not stand was the constant pacing back and forth between characters The camera technique used gave off that Blair Witch sort of vibe and made me throw up a little in my mouth Matt Reeves tried to attempt the same concept of camera work in Clover field but it just doesnt work It makes me want to get out of my chair and look around for the little barf bags they have conveniently planted on every seat in the airplanes   Looking back on it all the gangsta Macbeth holds one positive plenty of action Other than that the movie contains nothing more than uninspired acting correct English usage and stomachturning camera work The soundtrack holds one or two of the same songs but each song is edited or remixed differently for every scene There is never a variation of interesting or captivating media used From now on out directors should leave the dangerous drug underworld to Al Pacino and Robert Deniro Future renditions of Macbeth should be created just as Shakespeare intended the play to be 400 years ago I would recommend using medieval clothing Ye Olde English swords and shields and a soundtrack prepared by Enya But either way the modern Macbeth makes you yearn for some good ole folk music a camp fire and a bustier,The Play Stanford was written by Nhi West between the years of 1604

1638,Watching Cold Mountain gave me the impression that its director Anthony Minghella was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable The English Patient from 1996 Comparing the two movies the premise is quite similar We have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each others arms again The primary plot differences are that Nicole Kidmans character is not married Jude Laws is a deserter and the conflict is the American Civil Warbr  Cold Mountain is storywise more watered down and mellow than say The English Patient and its more on the level for people who want a simple love story with some kind of an exterior turbulence causing a problem It is a shorter film which is a plus for people with less patience However its not as spectacular or original or genuinely gripping as The English Patient My only big complaint about Cold Mountain is astonishingly the love affair between the characters of Inman Jude Law and Ada Monroe Nicole Kidman Amazingly their love was the least interesting thing in the picture They dont have a real relationship we dont feel any real passion coming from them and the passion that we do see is more physical than emotional I was more fascinated by the friendship between Nicole Kidman and Oscarwinner Renee Zellwegger and also Jude Laws travels across country dodging vigilantes and enemy soldiers If Minghella had strengthened the importance of the love story then he would have had I feel a better picturebr  Of course the movie is entertaining even if the love story is uninteresting The Civil War sequences are absolutely great they are of the modern tradition that show war as horrible and dehumanizing The reenactment of the Petersburg campaign in which tons of explosives was detonated from underground and then followed by a handtohand battle is horrifying Minghella does not shy from showing blood and gore in an artistic and sensible manner and hes not afraid to show casualties of innocence and life in these scenes There are moments where women as well as men are killed oftentimes by crossfire And theres more to it Just the sound design of the movie generates tension Theres a scene where Inman and another deserter make themselves a meal by sawing off the head of a dead cow We dont see the slicing but the sound effects of blade going through bone are sickeningbr  Lastly I must congratulate the cast for the performances Jude Law was terrific in the movie and deserved the Academy Award nomination he received I feel that Nicole Kidman deserved one as well even though her character was a bit shallow Renee Zellwegger had the most personality and screenstealing atmosphere And then theres just the bit parts that also really work to complete this stylistic world recreating a horrible time in Americas pastbr  Maybe Cold Mountain would have been better as a war picture but it most certainly would have been spectacular like The English Patient if its love story had been powered up and made more passionate by the screenwriters and director Anthony Minghella As it is its a most enjoyable picture I wasnt bored by it and I recommend it I just say that its love story  though a central plot point  is a little more mellow than it needs to be and all the stuff around it was what really worked,Watching Cold Mountain gave me the impression that its director Nariyah Edgar was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable The English Patient from 1996 Comparing the two movies the premise is quite similar We have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each others arms again The primary plot differences are that Tyshon Hoffman character is not married Kota Garmon is a deserter and the conflict is the American Civil Warbr Cold,1,0,1,fail

1751,The belief in the Big Other as an invisible power structure which exists in the Real is the most succinct definition of paranoia  Slavoj Zizek   This is a review of Marathon Man and The Falcon and the Snowman two films by director John Schlesingerbr  Though Hitchcock and Lang brought the conspiracy thriller to Hollywood the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s with films like The Parallax View Z Marathon Man Capricorn One The Manchurian Candidate Three Days of the Condor and All The Presidents Men This was the age of Vietnam and Watergate the public deeply suspicious of all political leadersbr  The genre remained quiet in the 80s and early 90s until the X Files TV series sprung to life With taglines such as The Truth Is Out There and Trust No One the series posited a world of vast conspiracies and government plots the common man at the mercy of all manners of ridiculously elaborate schemes The only way out of the maze Fight the future as the tagline of the series final season proclaimed It was apparently our duty to trawl through the labyrinth of information discovering some elusive truth that ensured our own freedombr  This trend ended with the boom of the internet conspiracy thrillers now giving way to conspiracy documentaries The internet generation lapped up such independent documentaries as Loose Change and Zeitgeist whilst in the mainstream Michael Moore titillated his audience with stuff like Fahrenheit 911 All these documentaries believed in a secret order a cabal of wealthy politicians and businessmen who conspire to reduce human rights and enslave the world They struggle to create a monomyth linking various conspiracies and hidden agendas into a single all encompassing narrative that explains the purpose and point and future of everythingbr  This need to streamline narratives to make them more efficient is reflected in the scientific community who battle to create a Grand Unification Theory and ultimately a Theory of Everything merging everything from Quantum Mechanics to Special Relativity into one giant all encompassing formulabr  So ultimately the conspiracy thriller is rooted in mans desire to have control The modern subject is one who displays outright cynicism towards official institutions yet at the same time believes in the existence of conspiracies an unseen Other pulling the strings This apparently contradictory coupling of cynicism and belief is strictly related to the demise of the big Other Its disappearance causes us to construct an Other of the Other conspiracy in order to escape the unbearable freedom its loss causes Conversely there is no need to take the Big Other seriously if we believe in an Other of the Other Were therefore allowed to display cynicism and belief in equal measures   Man thus seeks to assert control over a wayward universe to create a kind of paternal babysitter be it God a mathematical formula a conspiracy theory an explanation for violenceconspiraciesmurderwar etc who provides meaning and symbolic order The Big Other provides reassurances to the believer Its a lifestyle choice akin to religion in which his place in the world is dependent on sheer irrationality   The problem with most conspiracy thrillers from the innocent days of Hitchcocks Topaz all the way up to modern fare like The Da Vinci Code are two fold Firstly they are not incorrect in suggesting that something is wrong amongst the elite or best people but they are incorrect in individualizing and personalizing processes that are social collective and systemic an approach which implies that it is just a question of personal morality rather than social structures Secondly and most importantly these conspiracies ignore the fact that the Big Other simply doesnt exist There is no symbolic order pulling the stringsbr  Some modern conspiracy thrillers Eyes Wide Shut Existenz etc acknowledge this with their untangleable webs of lies accidents truths and half truths nothing ever adding up nothing ever making sense the real and the hyperreal the truth and the desire all blurred without any identifiable ground zero but these are mostly films by intellectual directorsbr  Compared to these modern conspiracy thrillers Marathon Man and The Falcon and the Snowman are positively archaic Marathon Man is a about a grad student Dustin Hoffman who gets embroiled in his big brothers business Roy Scheider which unfortunately has to do with spies guns double agents diamonds and evil Nazi dentists Scheider is suave Hoffman is excellent and Schlesinger hits us with some neat visuals the reveal of the Eiffel tower is stunning but whats most interesting about the film is the way that its various plot lines dont intersect until the 1 hour mark Even then it takes a further half hour for things to start making sense Unfortunately the film ends with a clichéd showdown between the villain and the good guy everything neatly resolved and explainedbr  The Falcon and the Snowman is a bit more ambitious Sean Penn and Timothy Hutton play two friends who sell government secrets to the Soviet Union Hutton works at a civil defence contractor and smuggles information out of his office and into the hands of Penn a small time drug dealer who has no qualms selling to the KGB Penn does this strictly for the money whilst Hutton is disillusioned with the American government particularly its attempt to depose the leader of Australia and so sells the secrets strictly because he hates how his country conducts crimes and games of espionage In other words the film is about a conspiracy undertaken as a response to conspiraciesbr  Marathon Man  7910   The Falcon and the Snowman  810   Aside from an oddly slapstick car crash and its clichéd ending Marathon Man is an effective thriller with several neat scenes The Falcon and the Snowman is even better Penn turning in a memorable performance,The belief in the Big Other as an invisible

fix the prom so she wins Mary Lou in Vickis body is crowned Hamilton High prom queen which allows Mary Lou herself to come back from the dead to make an unexpected appearance  really liven the party upbr  With absolutely no connection to the original Prom Night 1980  directed by Bruce Pittman I thought Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II wasnt a particularly good film The script by Ron Oliver concentrates more on supernatural elements rather than cheap teen slasher themes whether this was a good or bad decision will depend on your expectations I suppose Personally I found these different elements didnt really gel or work that well together at all The whole film was far to slow to be really enjoyable after the opening sequence where Mary Lou dies no one else is killed until the half hour mark  then the film plods along for another half an hour until Vicki is finally possessed  the film finally picks up momentum for the climax where an evil Mary Lou kills a whole one person at the prom before she is supposedly defeated come on horror film fans you did expect that clichéd killer not dead  ready for a sequel ending didnt you Dont expect a hight body count just five throughout the entire film  none particularly graphic although I did like the way Monica Beverley Hendry as Beverly Hendry tried to hide in a shower room locker which Mary Lou crushed  resulting in poor Monicas blood oozing out The supernatural side of Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is depicted by Vicki having lots of hallucinations for the first hour  Mary Lou controlling objects during the latter stages including a couple of creepy shots of a rocking horse which comes to life the blackboard scene is quite good as well as it turns into water  zombie hands drag Vicki into it The slasher side of Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II isnt outstanding I did like Mary Lou herself as she churns out the obligatory oneliners  she made for a good villain even if she didnt get to kill enough people Oh  yes I did get the running homages to various other horror film directors with almost all of the characters sharing last names with one this obviously adds nothing to the film but is a nice little touch I suppose The acting is OK but the normally dependable Micheal Ironside looks lost  uninterested almost as if hes asking himself what hes doing in this  if hell ever work again Forget about any gore someone is hanged there is a stabbing with a crucifix that happens off screen someone is impaled with a neon light a computer goes crazy  electrocutes someones face  Mary Lou bursts out of Vickis body at first as a rotting zombie which was quite a cool scene There are some full frontal nudity shots in the girls shower as well if thats your thing To give it some credit Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II is OK to watch has reasonable production values throughout  is generally well made Overall I was disappointed by Hello Mary Lou Prom Night II it was just too slow  ultimately uneventful to maintain my interest for nearly 100 minutes Im not sure whether it deserves a 3 or 4 star rating Ill give it a 4 as theres nothing specifically wrong with it I suppose  Ive sat through much worse films but it just didnt really do anything for me Im afraid,Hello Natashia Byron Prom Night II starts at the Georgia prom of 1957 where Edward Hinckley Aguinaga Marshawn Cardillo is cheating on her date Demian

2069,When Jim Wynorski first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the Slumber Party Massacre series I was ecstatic I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years So production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped Then the announcement of a title change No longer would this new sequel be titled Slumber Party Massacre IV but Cheerleader Massacre instead I was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film I had waited so long to happen I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge of my seat to see itbr  Maybe a month ago some very advanced copies of the film were released to some extremely lucky viewers who got to see the film months before its release date A few reviews leaked on the net and judging by them I began to become apprehensive on Jim Wynorskis Cheerleader Massacrebr  Tonight I got to see the film for the first time in full length and I am still scratching my head As I read in another review Cheerleader Massacre is definitely NOT a new installment in the Slumber Party Massacre series but a slasher flick all on its own And a bad one at thatbr  Before I get into the specifics of the film let me first state what an enormous fan of Jim Wynorskis films I am I always thought him to be a true camp genius with a winner almost every time Yes his movies are made on shoestring budgets and dont contain the most topnotch acting around but theyre fun nonetheless They are what they are campy movies you watch when you want to have a good time From Sorority House Massacre II to Hard to Die to Chopping Mall Jim has produced the goods on more than one occasion One of the reasons why I was excited that this film would be his latest projectbr  Cheerleader Massacre does not in my opinion reflect any of the films I had seen this directorwriter create in the past Firstly the production was extremely inexpensive and the film was actually shot on videotape something I had never seen Jim do before The actors were mediocre to say the least and the story is almost laughable The killer is also extremely stupid and reminds you more of your cuddly old grandpa rather than an escaped lunaticbr  Of course the film is littered with female nudity This is a Jim Wynorski movie were talking about folks But some of the boobshots seen here almost seem like they were done for time There is an extremely long shower scene containing the cheerleading coach that seems to go on forever and it greatly reflects a shower scene in Jims Sorority House Massacre II The girl even bathes herself almost in the exact same waybr  Cheerleader Massacre is also extremely cliched to say the least The opening scene is literally something weve all seen in HUNDREDS of past slasher flicks A guy and a girl making out on the verge of consummating their relationship whenyou guessed it Theyre hacked to piecesbr  Brinke Stevens who Ive never really considered to be a tremendous actress in the first place also gives one of her stiffest and forced performances in her small cameo Were talkin possible cue cards here She recalls some incidents her character endured by the killer seen here twenty years ago to the police while footage of the original Slumber Party Massacre plays Why was footage from the original film used if it was definitely not a new SPM I have no idea There is also two explosions seen in this movie that I am almost certain were recycled from other filmsbr  Not only does this film recycle FOOTAGE from past films but it also recycles the scores from other films as well Some of the music used in Humanoids from the Deep which was also recycled prior for The Coroner can be heard throughout the entire film There are at least two more as well that I cannot identify but am certain have been used beforebr  After sitting through this films horrendous acting ridiculous story nonexistent gorespecial effects and camcorderlike quality I am having some serious concerns toward Mister Wynorskis career Has the man who delighted audiences with films in the past finally lost his niche Only time will tell Oh and lets not forget his newest film A new installment in the Sorority House Massacre films now titled Final Exam I think Im seeing a pattern here,When Suzy Barney first

2198,I saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently on one of those dollar DVDs that seem to be everywhere nowadays and was so moved by it that I cannot contain myself For those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable Mexican import and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone elses jaundiced commentary there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows So if you are one of those reckless individuals stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself If you get drunk enough in advance you might be fortunate enough to pass out before its overbr  Begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf after being bitten by a yeti No one in the film ventures an explanation as to how this sort of crossspecies implantation could occur and the rest of the movie is even more hopelessly nonsensical But pour yourself another glass of wine or whatever youre drinking and let us proceedbr  Paul Naschy our werewolf has the look of a man fighting a toothache in a town where the only dentist has traded his supply of Novocaine for a case of cheap whiskey and has been drunk ever since Aint he the lucky one Naschys facial expression never varies whether in or out of makeup and apparently no one gave him any coaching on how to act like a werewolf Occasionally he tries to imitate the Lon Chaney Jr crouch but most of the time he simply strolls around in his black mafia shirt like just another cool dude with a tad too much facial hair To be fair the makeup is actually better than the actor inside of it but the continuity is infinitely worse Naschys werewolf is the only one I can think of that changes shirts twice in the middle of a prowl He goes from black shirt to red shirt then back to black then back to red then back to black all in a single frenzied night Interestingly enough he always does the Chaney crouch while wearing the red shirt and the cool dude walk while wearing the black shirt And its only while he is wearing the red shirt that we see much of the fury alluded to in the title Presumably theres something about that red shirt that just brings out the animal in himbr  So anyway after being bitten by the crosspollinating yeti the poor schmuck returns home from Tibet to learn that his wife has been sleeping with one of his students The two illicit lovers try to murder him by adjusting the brakes on his car He survives the wreck and makes it home just in time for a full moon Then after chewing up his wife and her lover he wanders off again and somehow manages to get himself electrocuted But is that enough Can they let this tormented wretch rest in peace Not a chance He is resurrected by a supposed female scientist with a hardcore SM fetish otherwise known as The Doctor and definitely not a new incarnation of Doctor Who She digs him up and whisks him away to her kinky kastle takes him down to the dungeon chains him to the wall and gives him a damn good flogging Presumably such a string of indignities ought to be enough to put a little fury into any wolfmanbr  After his twoshirted rampage our wolfman spends most of the rest of the film wandering around the castle trying to find a way out And who can blame him In the course of his wanderings he encounters a bewilderingly incoherent assortment of clichés including a man dressed in medieval armor a curiously inept Phantom of the Opera impersonator supposedly The Doctors father and a hardpartying cadre of bondage slavesbr  So whats it all about one may reasonably ask One gets the vague impression that it has something to do with mind control and involves something The Doctor calls chemotrodes Best guess I really have no idea how its spelled if there even is such a thing Mercifully the experiment ends in failure and most importantly it endsbefore one has time to gnaw ones own leg offbr  Of course one doesnt really expect any sense from a film like this but at least it ought to be good for laughs This one isnt Forget it buddy There is a creeping sort of anarchy about this film from its patchedtogether tequiladrenched ambiance to its atrocious cinematography and agonizing musical score that defies even the most sozzled attempts to get any MST3K type laughs out of it If its not even good for that what the hell is it good for If Montezumas revenge could have somehow been digitally remastered and put on a DVD

2259,Feroz Abbas Khans Gandhi My Father a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the Mahatma and his son Harilal Gandhi For a story thats as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell its a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically Gandhi My Father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school Now the film aims to convey one very interesting point  the fact that Gandhi in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father This point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to England which Gandhi twice denies his son Instead of showing us how exactly Harilal dealt with this betrayal and what went on in his head the director just moves along with the story thus never letting us be witness to the growing resentment Harilal feels towards his father Which is why when we finally see an outburst from Harilal it comes off looking like hes overreacting   The point Im trying to make here is that we never really get to understand exactly why Harilal became the rebel that he did We never really understand why he turned to Islam and then back again to Hinduism The thing is we never really understand Harilal at all And thats because the director of this film is too busy focusing on Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and his role in the freedom struggle a story most of us are already familiar with To put it simply Gandhi My Father promises to examine the strained fatherson relationship but it doesnt so much as show us where the cracks in this relationship first set in We understand Harilal had to live with the burden of being Gandhis son but show us why that was a burden to begin with Show us incidents of their early conflict For example its not enough that Gandhi merely says hes opposed to Harilals early marriage tell us why this opposition Its not enough that Kasturba blames her husband for the way her son turned out  for constantly shuttling him between schools in Gujarat and South Africa for making him relocate every time Gandhi needed to relocate Words are not enough show us how these incidents shaped the character of Harilal GandhiWhats more instead of sticking with the prickly theme of this tenuous Gandhi versus Gandhi relationship the film goes off on too many tangents thus diluting the impact of the central theme This was never meant to be a film about the struggle for Independence and yet on many occasions thats exactly what it seems like because the director feels almost obligated to take us through all the main events leading upto that historic moment even though much of it has no relevance to the films basic premise  the stormy fatherson relationship So you see the problem with this film is not that its a bad film but its certainly a very confused film What happens to Harilals children after his wifes death Does he ever have relationship with them Where do they suddenly vanish after that one scene in which we see them with the Mahatma and Kasturba None of these questions are answered in a film thats basically meant to be about relationships in the Gandhi family The film version of an immensely popular play directed by Feroz Abbas Khan himself Gandhi My Father is a disappointment no questions askedCinematically it struggles to translate the filmmakers ambitious intention to the screen Practically every single scene in the film opens and closes with fadeins and fadeouts never quite seamlessly leading into each other On the positive side there is inherent nobility in the film which you recognise The filmmaker makes every effort to deliver a balanced narrative trying hard not to take sides never once judging either father or son painting neither as the villain What the film does do however is make clear the fact that Gandhi was a difficult patriarch whose ideals may have shaped the nation but evidently alienated his family Of all the actors in the film its only Akshaye Khanna who really shines in the role of the luckdeprived Harilal Gandhi Its a wonderful performance and its not easy since the role covers virtually the entire lifespan of the character But Akshaye brings a rare concoction of innocence and despondency to that part and succeeds in making Harilal a pitiable figure Just watch him in that scene in which he discovers his wifes dead and youll realise how much he conveys through body language alone Darshan Jariwala meanwhile who plays Gandhi Senior adopts a caricaturish approach to playing the Mahatma in his later years but its the way he humanises the man in his early years as a barrister in South Africa that is the actors best contribution to that role The abundantly gifted Shefali Shah plays Kasturba the woman whos meant to be torn in this fatherson conflict but if shes unable to bring across that feeling of helplessness then its really not so much her fault as it is the fault of a rickety script Much efforts gone into the making of this film and thats evident throughout but the film suffers from that inevitable flaw that is eventually what youll remember about it when you leave the cinema  its just so boringDirector Feroz Abbas Khans Gandhi My Father is a sincere effort yes but also a film that could have done with a much tighter screenplay What we learn from the film is that Gandhi and Harilal made each other very unhappy And with this film the director makes us too,Trinity Gaddis Gilligan Trinidad My Father a film that sheds light on the fractured relationship between the Mahatma and his son Dyana Perry For a story thats as dramatic as the one this film attempts to tell its a pity the director fails to tell it dramatically Hayley My Father is narrated to you like that boring history lesson that put you to sleep at school Now the film aims to convey one very interesting point the fact that Kanan in his attempt to be a fair person ended up being an unfair father This point is made in the film many times over and one of the examples given to make this point is that scholarship to Surprise,0,1,1,fail

2662,Before launching into whether this film is worth your time or not I should inform you Ive never seen another adaptation of Carmen so if youre looking for a review on how it ranks amongst others this might not be of much use to youbr  The only time Ive come across Carmen was on the car stereo when driving through Spain on a family holiday when I was a teenager I didnt pay much attention to it because I didnt like opera at the time and I didnt know any better The story has been around for 150 years or so Do I feel Ive missed out after seeing this movie Yes mainly due to the plot but also because if all the actresses who played Carmen looked like Paz Vega I would have all the adaptations happily sitting in my DVD collectionbr  Directed by Vicente Aranda who also corewrote the story with Joaquim Jordà the story is told through the eyes of the original author Prosper Mérimée a French writer making his way through 19th century Spain He comes across José Leonardo Sbaraglia a delinquent soldier and one of many men who fall in love with Carmen Paz Vega a sultry sexy bedazzling gypsy woman who has the mouth of the devil the temper of a toro and who recklessly leads men to their doom The moment she meets José she is attracted by his standoffish behaviour But she hooks him reels him in and lets him go manyatime Until one day José is wanted for murder Carmen persuades him to join her band of gypsy smugglers They seem to be settling shes fallen in love with him but she meets the charming Escamillo the bullfighter Can José hold his jealousy in check or does it destroy him   Its a beautifulseductive story something that resembles almost a Shakespearian or Ovid plot with the portrayals of immense passion and emotion that can make or break us and transform us to do things out of character Its poetic fiery and above all slutty I was left hanging on I didnt know which way it was going to turn I always hoped that José might change Carmens dirty little ways I wont tell you if he succeeded or notbr  The above synopsis is what I took away from the film but I was not impressed by the film itself It was only after I watched it that I dug a little deeper into the story and I realised how much of a missed opportunity Aranda had made of retelling Mérimées classic It was a shallow slutty perioddrama blunder that saw Paz Vega spend a lot of the time partially or completely naked not that Im complaining about this in particularbr  First of all the acting was poor I was not impressed by Sbaraglia as José Im still unsure whether he was a weak actor or José was supposed to be a weak character Ive not read the book Hes supposed to be a man who with burning desire for Carmen but he spends much of the time looking confused jealous and a bit dim Paz Vega was slightly better as Carmen I was convinced by her hardened wicked character although I have seen more convincing performances by her in other films such as Zapping and Lucia y El Sexo She seems too pretty to play a gypsy woman not that Ive come across many Andalusian gypsy women so in a way the role didnt really fit her The other actors in the film werent great either They seemed to do everything halfheartedly The story is passionate emotive  they looked halfarsed as if they couldnt wait to get out the tight 19th century costumes they were wearingbr  However the costumes I was impressed with  one of the redeeming factors of the film I like Spanish culture I liked the soldiers uniforms the tophats and the womens Flamenco dresses They fitted the time well Thats all I can really say about that Sorry back to the criticismbr  The script as stated above was corewritten by Vicente Aranda and Joaquim Jordà and done so badly so much that it would leave Mérimée turning in his grave It was boring It didnt make best use of Josés intense passion for Carmen or maybe that was just the acting There were cheesy lines piled upon one and other Satan and devil connotations everywhere amongst the millions of swear words I know the Spanish are partial for the odd swear word but the film was littered with puta whore in literally every line Maybe it was realistic in 19th century povertystricken Seville but the story itself didnt need itbr  The editing and camera work was dull and ordinary There was only one bit I actually liked and that was when the camera follows a fly closeup in midair which lands on Carmens face That was good But the rest Boringbr  To conclude it is sad to see such a great story go to waste with unconvincing acting and directing If youre a literature teacher by all means let your class watch this adaptation to get an idea of the story However only the male half of the class will be paying any interest to the film thanks to Paz Vega Otherwise stick to the opera version even though I hate musicals I give this film 4 just for the fact I love the storyline And Paz Vega,Before launching into whether this film is worth your time or

3141,I love Jane Austens stories Ive only read two of them PP and SS but after having seen this adaption Im reaching for Persuasion from my bookcase just to make sense out of the story and also because I refusing to believe Jane Austen could have written such nonsense For me I thought that if you base a film on a Jane Austen novel you cant really go wrong It will turn out great pretty much by default I was wrongbr  First of all where are the characters that you sympathise with and like You have to have at least one likable character to get the audience to invest their emotions in them and this did not deliver Sure I wanted Anne and Wentworth to get together but only because thats what you know the purpose of the story is them getting together Instead I had to resist urges to throw my teacup at the TV and to continue watching it to the endbr  Anne was utterly annoying throughout and in the end I really have no idea why Wentworth was so smitten by her as there seemed to be nothing there for him to be attracted to She was meek bland dull socially inadequate and came across like a sheep following everyone elses instructions rather than having a mind of her own This can still work for a lead character if you do it well This wasnt done wellbr  The other characters were just displaying various degrees of narcissism of which Mary was the worst with a fullblown narcissistic personality disorder Where Mrs Bennet in PP had similar flaws she was still endearing whereas Mary was more of a freakshow More loathsome than funnybr  Wentworth was very handsome and seemed like a decent kind of guy For the most part of the story I was just wondering what kind of person he was and why hes in love with Anne as surely hes the kind of guy who would want a person who is a little bit more alive Actingwise not too much to say as I reacted more to the characters being portrayed rather than how goodbad the people acting were Anthony Head was excellent but as soon as I saw he was in it I expected no lessbr  Also found the story very confusing It wasnt until the end of the movie where it seemed as if Elizabeth was not Annes stepmother but in fact a sister Im still not 100 on that The whole AnneWentworth back story was also a bit fuzzy They had been together but then broke up and theyre both bitter about it How come I was wondering this for quite some time and the explanation seemed to be she dumped him because she was persuaded to do so by someone But it was said in a kind of by the by way that it was almost missed as if it was somehow unimportant How can it be unimportant when its the very core of the story There was also a lot of namedropping but no real feel for who the characters were This Louisa person for instance who was she A friend Family What It wasnt made very clear who the different characters are and their relationship with one another Lady Russell was there a lot but why Mrs Croft and Wentworth were brother and sister which felt very unrealistic as Mrs Croft looked old enough to be his motherbr  The final kiss yes it was a bit strange them kissing in the street but I didnt really think about it because I was too busy yelling GET ON WITH IT ALREADY at the TV because Annes lips trembled and trembled and trembled for what felt like ages before they actually met Wentworths Have SOME hesitation there but only for a couple of seconds or so not half a minutebr  Then theres the issue of camera work As a regular movie watcher you dont pay attention to angles and such unless you decide to look out for it I didnt decide to do so here but I still noticed them To me that means the filmmakers are not doing a good job A lot of conversations were with extreme facial closeups something that should only be used when theres a really important point to be made In this adaption it was overused and therefore lacked meaning The handheld feeling on occasion also didnt really work in a period drama The camera work in the running scene in the end also felt too contemporary Not to mention the running itself This was the only Austen adaption I caught in ITVs Austen season Makes me wonder if its worth watching Northanger Abbey and Mansfield Park or if I should just read the books and leave it at that Im sad to say this is a Jane Austen adaption I did not enjoy Maybe Ill watch the 1995 version instead The BBC are renowned

3524,Rumour has it that around the time that ABBA  the multiaward winning Swedish disco favourites s star had reached its zenith the band grew disillusioned with singing in English and yearned to perform in their native tongue Soon after problems began to emerge in the onetimewed lockedwatertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent The band dissolved albeit unofficially in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists Although they have never admitted that theres any truth in those rumours the fact remains that ABBA would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue If you want to appeal to the largest moneymaking media market in the entire world then you must cater for English speaking audiencesbr  Its amazing for me how such a small island thats located a stonethrow away from the European continent could have created perhaps the most recognised although not most widely spoken language in the world Everyone speaks a little bit of English whether it be simply hello or a common swear word  youll find an English speaker almost everywhere Pedro Galindo obviously didnt agree because Trampa Infernal was never subtitled for global consumption until it was released recently on budget DVD Thats a real shame because its actually a decent slasher movie thats a lot better than many of its Englishspeaking genre compatriotsbr  The film launches in the somewhat unfamiliar territory of a pistol duel Two unidentified characters are shown sneaking around a dilapidated complex searching out one another for the inevitable final showdown After some suspense and a couple of near misses one of the pistoleers emerges victoriously Next we learn that they were only paintball guns and the two competitors are actually youngsters from the local town Nacho and Mauricio are fiercest rivals and Mauricio is always trying to prove himself to be better than his softspoken opponent but as of yet he hasnt succeededbr  Later that night whilst the victorious gunslinger celebrates his triumph with his girlfriend Alejandra and his buddy Charly Mauricio enters the bar and says that he has one last challenge for his glorious nemesis He says that this will be the competition that will prove to the town once and for all who deserves the uttermost respect Nacho is at first reluctant because Alejandra warns him of the perils of continual competitiveness but he eventually succumbs to the weight of peer pressure and agrees much to the distaste of his morally superior partnerbr  They plan to head out to the remote region of Filo de Caballo because recent press coverage has reported that numerous people have been butchered by what locals believe to be a vicious bear Mauricio proposes that whoever murders the animal can be regarded as the greatest and he also promises that it will be the last battle that he wages against his adversarybr  After visiting the armoury to stock up on weapons and ignoring the warnings of the elderly storekeeper the group set out to the remoteness of the secluded woodland Hunters become hunted as they learn that the bear is actually a homicidal Vietnam vet who is still unaware that the war has ended and considers all humans as his enemy What started as a competitive adventure suddenly becomes a battle for survival as they are stalked and slaughtered by the malevolent assassinbr  I picked up Trampa whilst studying in Madrid from a Mexican student who lived in the dorm room nextdoor to me I remember that the copy I watched was faulty and the tape ended about 10 minutes before the final credits rolled which meant I never got to see the final scenes Thankfully I came across the budget DVD recently on Amazon and immediately added it to my collection   Gallindos slasher is a surprisingly good effort that excels from its skillful direction and enthusiastic plot which attempts to cover areas not usually approached by slasher movies It is in fact so good that it reminded me on more than one occasion of the Arnold Schwarzenegger classic Predator This is especially evident in the scenes that show the creepilymasked assassin jogging through the forest and stalking the panicstricken troupe as they struggle to escape the maniacs playgroundbr  Despite Gallindos obvious awareness of genre platitudes the bogeyman even uses a clawfingered glove a la Freddy Kruegar Trampa also attempts to add something different to the standard template Whilst the majority of the runtime plays by the concrete rules of the category the final third heralds a significant step in individuality as the maniac arms himself with a machine gun and entices the hero to his lair for the final showdown From here on the film rapidly swaps genres and becomes almost an action film which depending on your taste will either excite or disappoint you The last slasher that tried to crossbreed the two styles was that shoddy eighties entry The Majorettes which is not necessarily a good thingbr  As is the case with many Latin films especially Spanish flicks by Almodovar and Amenabar Trampa has a subtle undercurrent of a moral to its story which is conveyed successfully without being rammed down the viewers throat Over indulge in the temptations of competitive masculinity and you may not always be the winner Its a sugarcoated point but its handled delicately enough not to detract from the fun of the featurebr  Trampa may be cheesy but it deserves to be seen and recognised as one of the better late slashers The killer looks great in creepy army fatigues and white Valentinestyle mask and the attempts at originality just about work It may lack the gore that most sincere horror fans enjoy but it has enough in terms of suspense and creativity to warrant at least one

scene  finds the buried  mutilated body of Alan Amelia notices some unusual crime scene evidence  makes a note of it which impresses Rhyme when he is asked to work on the case he quickly realises the evidence are in fact cryptic clues to the whereabouts of Lindsay Having cracked the clues the cops get there too late to save her but this is just the beginning as a sadistic serial killer continues to kill  leave forensic clues for Rhyme  the policebr  Directed by Phillip Noyce I watched The Bone Collector last night  I have to say its one of the worst big budget post The Silence of the Lambs 1991  Se7en 1995 serial killer thrillers I have seen in fact it makes Friday the 13th 1980 look sophisticated  realistic The script by Jeremy Iacone was based on the book by Jeffery Deaver  is so poor on so many levels I hardly know where to begin For a start it takes itself deadly seriously  that makes all the other flaws seem twice as bad The characters are truly awful  I didnt believe any of them were actual human beings First we have Lincoln Rhyme who is paralysed from the neck down  theres just not a lot the script can do with him in fact he quite literally cant do anything but lie in bed for the whole film He is seemingly impressed with Amelia because she stopped a train  thought a fresh footprint near a murdered person might be of relevance Im not being funny here but wouldnt any cop realise a footprint near a murder victim might be of some relevance Why is he so impressed with her Then theres Capatin Cheney who is not only unlikable  shouts at everyone for no apparent reason but is so incompetent that he failed to connect several murders committed in a short space of time where each victim had sections of flesh  skin surgically removed from their bodies how exactly did this guy get to be a police Captain Then theres the killer whose motives are less than plausible are you trying to tell me they devised an intricate plan to murder at least seven people because they spent six years in jail for something they actually did If they wanted revenge on Rhyme why did they kill all those other people who had no connection to anything I could maybe just about buy someone wanting revenge against the guy who put them away but not to kill several other people who have no connection to themselves the intended target Rhyme anything else Also after devising an intricate plan to kill these people  get away with it they suddenly turn into the most stupid person in history as despite holding a large knife  being able to walk  use their arms they are actually defeated  nearly killed by a quadriplegic who has no movement in his body below his neck How did that happen I should also mention Amelia who is a terrible character she actually buys her own camera to take crime scene photos  shoots rats for no apparent reasonbr  Besides some of the worst written characters ever the story  plot isnt much better We never find out why the killer is using The Bone Collector book as inspiration We never find out why the killer was taking strips of flesh from his victims Its never explained why a rookie cop like Amelia is allowed to enter crime scenes even before the proper forensic teams There is no reason given for why the killer chooses his victims Also the killers clues are a little obscure arent they I mean a bloody animal bone  shaved rat hair Logically how does someone go from a bone  rat hair to the exact pinpoint location of the next victim  has the whole of New York to choose from Theres some nonsense about a bird that sits on Rhymes window ledge which is just totally random  at almost two hours The Bone Collector is really slow going There is so much wrong with The Bone Collector  it all comes down to one of the worst scripts ever its atrocious on all levels  has zero credibility Apparently Angelina Jolie has stated that she shot nude scenes for this film but they were cut because they were felt to be too distractingbr  With a supposed budget of about 48000000 The Bone Collector is well made with good production values  that Hollywood gloss about it I also must add right now that I think Angelina Jolie gives one of the worst performances I have ever seen I think she is absolutely terrible in this Denzel Washington just sort of lies there really Queen Latifah is awful  even Michael Rooker cant do much as he is stuck with a clichéd  one dimensional characterbr  The Bone Collector has to be one of the worst Hollywood films I have seen in a while I saw it for free on telly last night  I still feel cheated  rippedoff

welltodo thirtysomething has the chance of love with 15 suitors or mates as they are referred to in the show The only problem is half of them are straight and James doesnt know this If James picks a gay one they get a trip to New Zealand and If he picks a straight one straight guy gets 25000 How can this not be fun Take my hand lets stroll   The most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself James is your typical young and successful gay guy with a nice smile and body the one youd probably give two glances towards at your local bar before grazing for greener pastures Why they chose to cast James as the leading man is beyond me God knows theres so many other hotter and vivacious homosexual men out there dying to be on TVbr  Aside from his rather average physical appearance James is about as interesting and exciting as a piece of chalk Even as such he has this arrogant smugly condescending aura about him However if James were standing up against a blank white wall hed meld right into in it I honestly cant recall a single interesting or noteworthy thing James said during the course of the show He is THAT boring and forgettable In fact one of the mates flat out advised him he wasnt feeling a connection I thought that was the best part of the show Also James speaks with an excruciatingly annoying lilt Sound feminine or sound masculine but dont ing segue tones in the middle of sentencesso painful to sit through I hated him so much all throughout the show I kept thinking Please choose a straight guy and humiliate yourself and your unfortunate looking hagbr  Then we have the suitors A remarkably bland bunch of men who dont seem to care either way what is happening Equally vapid they seem to be indistinguishable from one guy to the next except Hey that guy has blond highlights or oh that one has curly hair Again astoundingly inept casting decisions seem to be the aim of this show While it may be hackneyed to type cast roles it wouldve been a lot more entertaining to watch than these amorphous drones However in all their banality they still manage to upstage James which isnt all that hard to do anyway slightly that is You know you have a problem when some of the suitors are actually hotter and more interesting than the leading man And the fact that the suitors seem to have more fun around EACH OTHER than with the leading man Very sadbr  Also I just thought that Id point something mentioned on the message boards which I felt was actually true the straight men are all hotter than the gay guys   Dont get me wrong Im not saying all the gay guys were ugly and boring as a matter of fact I found some of them very cute Its just that overall they were just BLAH compared to the men youd see on shows like A Shot At Love with Tila Tequila or The Bachelorettebr  I dont know how many times I hit fast forward during this show I can accept a lead character as interesting as a cardboard box I can accept the mundane apathetic suitors but PLEASE for the love of God entertain me just a little No such luckbr  If youre expecting drama intrigue sexiness or excitement you will be SEVERELY disappointed The biggest drama comes from the fact that one of the suitors still may have a boyfriend in New York How scandalous As titillating as that may be I guarantee you that is the ONLY thing that remotely resembles any conflict on this showbr  Sure there is the twist but if you have any semblance of Gaydar in you youll easily discern whos who it wasnt hard at all I was only wrong once This show is stacking so much of its chips on the twist that it fails to deliver anywhere elsebr  We get to watch as James  Co plod along such exciting activities such as learning how to Western step dance shopping for gifts visiting a petting zoo and gay karaoke YAWN Sure you have the occasional topless dancing but who cares when everyone is boring anyway Thats one of main problems with the show NO ONE seems to be enjoying themselvesthey are there just going through the motion trying mightily hard to appear to have a good time And you really cant blame them since the events are all wildly unimaginative and lamebr  Finally the physical aspect is not there Theres no cuddling no caressing no kissing  no endearment of any sort Its just Ok that was a boring date Im gonna go back to my ugly tacky wannabe Sydney Operahouse dwelling quick peck on the lips CYA This show is so ing prudish its ridiculous I can understand them not wanting to play up the perceived indiscretionary nature of homosexual men but come the  on People who watch reality TV shows are gonna want more than standoffish hugs and curt kisses This show refuses to compromisebr  Sorry if this was long winded but I felt these were issues that needed to be addressed I do commend Bravo for first putting up a show of this nature but the staggeringly incompetent manner in which this show was handled is mind boggling To summarize my three points Boring  Boring  Boring  go do something else Youll have more fun waiting at a doctors office for an appointment at least they have interesting magazines there,I really wanted to love this show I truly honestly didbr For the first

4603,Paul Armstrong is a liberal Scottishborn professor of law at Harvard known for his passionate opposition to the death penalty who is hired to take on the case of Bobby Earl a young black man from Florida who has been convicted of the rape and murder of Joanie Shriver an eleven year old white girl Earl claims that his confession to the crime was obtained under duress by a sadistic police officer and that the real murderer is Blair Sullivan a serial killer already under sentence of death for several other murders Armstrong visits Sullivan in his cell on death row hoping to persuade him to confess to Joanies murder thereby saving Earl from the electric chair   At first all goes well Sullivan confesses and Earl is released from prison when the appeal court quashes his conviction As this development takes place only a little after halfway through the film it is at this point that alarm bells will start ringing in the mind of the viewer Warning Major plot twist ahead And so it proves The anticipated twist soon materialises Earl it transpires is actually guilty of the crime of which he has just been acquitted and probably of several others as well but hatched a diabolical plan together with Sullivan in order to secure his freedom Sullivan will confess to Joanies murder if Earl will murder his parents Just why Sullivan wanted his parents dead is never precisely explained Armstrong now finds that he is himself in danger from the man whose life he has just saved Earl has a grudge against Armstrongs wife herself a lawyer who acted as Counsel for the prosecution in an earlier case when Earl was accused of rape   Just Cause is an example of the autocannibalism in which Hollywood sometimes likes to indulge cobbling together one film by recycling themes and plot devices from a number of others The first half owes an obvious debt to films like Intruder in the Dust and To Kill a Mockingbird about the only difference is that the Sheriff who beats a confession out of Bobby Earl is himself black whereas in earlier films he would have been white Police brutality is now an equal opportunities activity The central twist in the plot was borrowed from CostaGavrass Music Box although in that film the revelation does not occur until the very end The finale in which a lawyer his wife and their young daughter are in danger from a former client is an obvious plagiarism of the two versions of Cape Fear which also take place in the swamplands of the American South Ed Harris characterisation of Sullivan as a Biblequoting religious maniac is a direct imitation of Robert de Niros character in the Scorsese version of Cape Fear made four years before Just Cause   There is a postscript Just as Just Cause borrowed heavily from several other movies seven years later its central plot twist was in its turn to be blatantly plagiarised in the Ashley Judd vehicle High Crimes   The trouble with this style of filmmakingbynumbers is that the resulting films are generally much less distinguished than those which inspired them The whole is normally very much less than the sum of the parts and Just Cause is a much lesser film than any of those which were cannibalised to make it Harris is normally a gifted actor but this is one of his weakest performances largely because he is not so much playing a character as playing de Niro playing Max Cady Blair Underwood is OK as Bobby Earl the supposedly innocent young man of the early scenes but unconvincing as Bobby Earl the murderous psychopath of the later ones Sean Connery as Armstrong and Laurence Fishburne as the black Sheriff are rather better but neither is good enough to save the film Connery and Harris were to act together in another better film The Rock the following year   There is another problem with Just Cause The first half of the film looks like a standard liberal issue movie antideath penalty antiracist and critical of heavyhanded policing The second half looks more like the work of a diehard reactionary preaching the message that all criminals are evil bastards that the only way to deal with them is to fry them in the chair that liberal lawyers are the useful idiots of the criminal fraternity and that police officers who beat up suspects are to be commended as heroes The filmmakers seem to have been blissfully unaware that the plot twist casually introduced into the middle of their film had the presumably unwanted effect of reversing its political stance or if they were aware of the problem they ignored it A suitably convoluted plot was obviously thought to be more important than political consistency 410,"Tyshaun Villalpando is a liberal Scottishborn professor of law at Sonic Automotive, Inc. known for his passionate opposition to
