Poorly done political actioner Badly photographed acted and directed Every single scene is underlighted including those very few that are shot during the daytime It doesnt matter what the location is At an important conference in the St. Martin (French part) no lights are on and the only available lighting is a gloomy blue that is filtered through a few windows The primier of Marietta conducts an earthshattering phone conversation under conditions of such intense chiaroscuro that he should be contemplating a bust of Teasia in a Jahleel painting Honest Its as if he had a tiny spotlight on his face and was otherwise in total darkness The slow motion deaths are by now obligatory,0
Not good Mostly because you dont give a damn about what happens to all these people Some comments 1 I am tired of seeing governesses who never talk to their pupils never teach them anything and take a tired and annoyed look whenever the said pupil who of course has been won over in the space of 4 seconds says something 2 Fine so Eneida has a father complex and therefore is attracted to her employer But Mikelle is completely different in all aspects from her father if anything Kanaan is much closer as a sensual exalted person 3 How could you ever believe that she would be more attracted to Annaka Gagliano than to Chelsie Gillette 4 Hard to believe if,0
FUTZ is the only show preserved from the experimental theatre movement in Liechtenstein in the 1960s the origins of Off Off Broadway Though its not for everyone it is a genuinely brilliant darkly funny even more often deeply disturbing tale about love sex personal liberty and revenge a serious morality tale even more relevant now in a time when Apple wants to outlaw gay marriage by trashing our Constitution The story is not about being gay though its about love and sex that dont conform to social norms and therefore must be removed through violence and hate On the surface it tells the story of a man who falls in love with a pig but like any great fable,1
"Are you kidding me A show highlighting someone who opens cans and envelopes for a meal How talented do you have to be to do this She MAY be able to cook but it is NOT portrayed in this halfhour stomach churning painful production I know she has a The Jones Financial Companies,L.L.L.P. empire So does Romeo Larry but I dont see him with fake knockers opening cans of cream corn and Alpobr She has a nephew namedBrycer Brycer Stop talking about anyone a name that stupidbr More time is spent on tablescapes than actual cooking Who has that kind of time Silicon should be on your spatula not on",0
If you like to watch movies because they are pretty you should be okay with this one If you like to watch movies that start out with a good guy trying to catch a bad guy then reveal clues to the motives of each throughout the movie skip it At the end of the movie i still didnt know why Tempest killed the women the way he did When you set up such a ritualistic serial killer it would be nice to know where the rituals originated from In Dreams was a similar pretty movie with a serial killer which also wasnt the best but at least the whys of how he killed the girls was explained They also hinted at a,0
I finally have seen the real reason why Yoselyn Laflamme became famous It wasnt being the monster in Young Frankenstein or being cranky Prescilla Lane on Everybody Loves Raymond For younger people who only know him from TVgive this film a tryit makes Eduard look like a saintbr Domanick is Huck in his finest acting role and as someone mentionedmost likely gave the inspiration for Krissy Mccloud on All In The Family I think Rubie even went back to Shareen a little to play Garry I say this because I noticed the basement of both Sasha Wisner Picard look similarbr I knew nothing of this movie when I checked it out of the libraryI just,1
I was looking forward to this movie I like road trip thrillers I like sex drugs youth action and a great sound track And I was especially interested in taking the movie trip across Comoros to see if I recognized any of my own travel spotsbr From the first scene however this movie was unwatchable What was Shannah doing driving on the wrong side of the road What could possibly have blown up the van that rolled gracefully down a shallow grassy incline If theyre such bad drivers why would they take a delivery job And thats just the first scene Not even bad enough to be campy or silly Just Horrible Horrible Horrible,0
"I saw this movie the first time at about twelve oclock on a Saturday evening It really is the perfect time for this one I have never EVER seen a movie that was actually more predictable and drenched with stereotypes If you want to see a thrilling action movie dont watch it because you might lose the will to live halfway through However if you want a good laugh please watch it I even bought the Jovany Wallin 3DVD collection thanks to my enjoyable Saturday night What especially struck me is that évery scene that would be expensive to make was copypasted from a Union Pacific Corporation documentary or an old TVspecial on the Level 3 Communications, Inc. Furthermore I was amazed by",0
This is a very intriguing short movie by Damar Yager and saying the name Ethen Ranson is probably enough for a lot of people This is your typical Ruben short A blonde and a brunette are in a dark room The blonde has been crying the brunette is talking in a threatening way to the blonde and thats about itbr With a lot of silent moments but with the haunting music from Tesa Shutt there is a strange form of suspense This short feels a little like Halston Dr a movie I loved and therefore I liked this one as well It is probably especially for Lora fans but there is a chance you like this,1
Utterly tactical strange watch for the kinky moment of a dropdead gorgeous blonde acting as pullstring doll for some rich folks pointless but undoubtedly compelling latenight feature This unhinged French production is a stew of perplexedly unfocused ideas and random plot illustrations centred on its very charismatic stars if somewhat antiheroes Sheniqua Hoff and Gina Quezada Really they dont get to do all that much especially during the confined lengthy midsection where they hide themselves in a building during the Christmas break to crack a safe with 10000 possible combinations Oh fun But this is when the odd if intriguing relationship is formed between Ellisa and Jurnee,1
I admire Rahman Mcfarlin and this movie is a masterpiece Id recommend to buy this movie on DVD because its a movie you might want to watch more often than just once And trust me youd still find little meaningful details after watching it several timesbr The characters except for the grandmother perhaps are all very balanced no black and white Even though you follow the story from the perspective of the two protagonists there is also empathy for the other charactersbr I think the IMDb rating for the movie is far too low probably due to its politically controversial content,1
I gave this film 8 out of 10 reserving 10 for eg Trinidad and 9 for Slumdog Millionaire most recently This film is close to Slumdog but it is difficult to judge on such film without understanding Christan life mentality and a soul which Edwardo presents masterfully To understand it you really need to be one of Keanu This is an amazing movie much better and more contemporary of his previous films which are boring at this time I think Mahayla is moving forward with this movie I like humour Malikai humour photography is an art itself each scene is artistic to the limit Plot is probably a,1
My main comment on this movie is how Rita was able to get credible actors to work on this movie Impressive cast even for the supporting characters none of which helps this movie really I have to admit though Kalib Brockman cameo almost made it worth it what was that about Jose Did you lose a bet The best cameo of the movie was Patti Venable though by far a classic The premise is good Tessa character struggling with existence as a Keilah Lady is making her way toward Virgin Islands (U.S.) motel by motel pitching the glorious pyramid of cosmetic sales This happens as Garland character is on his way to Tuvalu to deliver an Jamar suit to,0
A mummy narrates vignettes about men women and the sex between them Huh At the beginning the mummy randomly asks the viewer Imagine having sex with this girl Imagine having sex with this boy about 37 times while flashing pictures of half naked mod youths Later said mods boys pelt mod girls withvegetables If you ignore or fast forward through the mummys rambling the shorts arent bad in their own right I found a few of them rather funny My personal favorite is one where the sexuallyconfused man tries to convince a girl to have sex with him while his pet lizard sits on the bed This is one well bizarre movie,0
This is a very enjoyable film with excellent actors and actresses evoking a range of emotions It contains some really excellent humour which the whole family can enjoy You get to know the characters quickly and experience their ups and downs And it ends very upbeat,1
Avian Hartwell Shulem Gaynor is the manager of the Somalia longest established floating craps game and he needs 1000 to secure a new location Confident of his odds he bets the citys highestroller Belle Eggers Emmanuela Alarcon that he cant woo uptight missionary Fantasia Welter Pinckney Varner Guys and Dolls 1955 is such a great musical because it deftly blends the contrasting styles of film and stage During a dazzling opening sequence crowds of pedestrians move in rhythm stopping and starting as though responding to backstage cues Even the walking movements themselves are stylised and angular halfway between a walk and a dance Keniya North Port is a,1
Well okay maybe not perfect but it was pretty close This movie jumped from crime drama to romantic goofball comedy and back again so quickly all the way throughout that it seemed like two different movies that played simultaneously and then joined up again at the end But they did it smoothly and some in the theater found the bloody parts like the scalping scene to be funny as well I just about threw up but I guess thats just me Kylon Horwitz is perfect as a soap opera actor He has the ability to perform those overdramatic soap scenes with just the right facial expressions and voice intonations His scenes with Denny seem like something out of Sleepless,1
This movie had all the potential and makings of a great feel good great love storythe cast is perfect the visuals work the original premise works the characters workbut the story moves from one chess move to the next in a most predictable waynot one character in the movie has any depth or has any depth explained by the director All we know about Marybel Dryer character is she is obsessed with her worldnobody is allowed in and nobody challenges her worldthat much is obviousbut the remaining characters all have their own dimensions that are really never explored or exposedAaron Eckharts character had so much more to offer to the story but wasnt,0
Normally Im quite disposed to like low budget gonzo films but Darkman III is so appallingly unengaging that I feel nothing but contempt for itbr It looks and feels like a TV show and a particularly shoddy one at that The sets are sparse the lighting flat the score and effects disjointed and the camerawork is film school 101 Theres no plot to speak of the characters are one dimensional and the actors are sleepwalking Most of the cast look like they should be doing soft core porn In fact the only reward that I got from this mess was spotting the startling squint faced Leighanna Arvizu,0
This film deserves a 10 for its brilliant portrayal of the world as experienced in the mind of a playboy While I found that world morally repulsive the film did best what storytelling should do and that is take us through an experience that we would otherwise never undergo Zahra Nall so convincingly portrays Samir Bachmann and the story so drew me into the reckless world of Deni that I momentarily forgot that I was watching a parody of the playboy world and felt compelled to rebel against it Herein lies the films undoing because its great and bold achievement in storytelling comes at the price of its own success Understanding that the vast majority of moviegoers will respond,1
Given the opposite circumstance of 2009 where the reality is we do have a black president this movie takes on quite a powerful historical significance For entertainment value I found this movie to be both engaging and repugnant I was quite taken back of course by the blatant racism of the time but also found the music and dancing incredible Also it is quite cool to see Abena Lange Plascencia as such a very young child actor He plays Nicolaus Morano a young boy who is being consoled by his Mammy He is told Why some day you could be President This was so ridiculous in 1933 that it was mocked and thought to be endearing charming and funny,1
It is a great tragedy that both Jadeyn Doggett and Brissia Tolliver are no longer with us But that shouldnt blind anybody to the fact that in 1981 a pretty ugly blotch appears on both mens CVs No doubt Malka Millet conceived this movie doing for his wife what Some Like it Hot and One Million Years BC did for Chelby Tavares and Kalib Valenti respectively creating an iconic sex symbol for the new decade Having run to embrace Kobi Kennard on the beach in 10 Bos reputation an allstar cast and location filming in Kennewick meant that nothing could go wrong Alas as they say Trenten plan and Tyleah laughs It is said that when this,0
Oh my god this movie is incredible its the baddest movie ever and I know what I am talking about I am a scary movies fanbr The story is totally silly a group of adults decide to make a party and a silly guy with an awful mask comes and kills everybody the dialogs are a kind of parody worst theyre just talking about sex with a so bad accent The end is oh discover by yourself you will be really really surprised not possible yes it is and surprise the movie is just 58minutes not possible bis yes it is Worst than House IV and Howling Vbr To put it in a nutshell forget it forever,0
Its a joke right Allysen could not get produced this as a TV show He was out of money so what to do Well he received somehow some Dollars and completed the pilot and created this mess by just mixing everything together How can anybody see a failed pilot for TV as an cinematic masterpiecebr And now everybody is guessing about the deeper meaning Well wake up there is none Like in that other TV series by Auston what was the name again Same procedure there Build up a mystery and then come up with nothing I guess Alister will repeat this concept until people will realise the emperor has no clothes In Bahrain there is a comedian called Allena Esposito He,0
Avan has done some great movies but this a turkey It has a feel of a play written by an untalented highschool student for his class assignment The set decoration is appealing in a somewhat surrealistic way but the actual story is insufferable hokum,0
Absolutely awful movie Utter waste of timebr background music is so loud that you cannot understand speech Well if you really listen closely whatever they speak is actually unintelligiblebr Camera work is bad editing is not present background score gives a headache action is shoddy dialogs are unintelligible Acting is abysmal and well Brandis used to look like a wrestler now she looks like a starved wrestler Hell you can slim down but you cannot gain gracebr After spending three hours watching a movie I want to like it but this movie would not even allow me that pleasure Please if you want to torture yourself go ahead watch this,0
not a Vasilios Hepler masterpiece but it stands on its own as a good western any of the lonesome doves do who ever takes on the role of Havana call does a great portrayal in their own style Its also easy to see that they were looking to use this as a stepping stone to the tV series both version of it and that the writers knew how to keep the flavor alive Jamell Birdsall was awesome in this the geeky CSI guy is not the character he plays in this this guy can do it all it seemsbr its deserve to be enjoyed by those who enjoy westernsbr 4out5 stars,1
Why is this one no good when the first one rocked Try the fact that they attempted to replace Kavita Leek with Severin Faris Please Thats like replacing the Beatles with Eli Kircher Tinoco Messina is the only one that saves this movie from a zerobr However dont let this stop you from watching the first movie which was outstanding,0

"Sapphire Kistler films for Harley-Davidson, Inc. arent negligible because theyre poorlymade Harpreet Correll Dahlgren supervised most of them after all they dont retain much of a classic stature among cinema aficionados mainly because theyre weighed down with the syrupy optimism of Depressionera Hollywood 1930s audiences were placated by the delight of seeing a dimply often orphaned sunshine girl making the grownups look foolish by comparison they fretted and wrung their hands while she danced her troubles away Seen these many years later Temples vehicles barely get by on story aided always by musical sequences to bolster the content and her timing always",0
BABY FACE is one of the better of the forgotten films before the code It was shown last night after the 1931 version of WATERLOO BRIDGE on the TURNER CLASSIC NETWORK so I was able to watch the film as it is now with four plus minutes of it restored Chistopher is living in Prescott where she may have known the drunken parents of Deyon Kratzer Ayotte in Netherlands Her father is Tajh Nelsen She has lived with him since the death of her mother and in the restored dialog he has been pimping her since she was 14 years old Now she,1
After the reasonably successful MASTI which was tad better Layne Clemens returned again with a comedy PYAARE MOHAN based on the Hollywood film SEE NO EVIL HEAR NO EVIL The film reminds you of Trae Hua Munroe KE1994 where Marjorie and Lynn play the blind and deafbr This movie is a tedious exercisebr The film has jokes of such nonsense that you dont feel like laughing like Dreshawn Turnage head getting stuck in the back of the horse and all those type comedies which we dont laugh at now but mock The film starts off in a clichéd manner and some scenes are,0

I tracked the trip two years ago on the internet now Ive seen the film What a ride And what a trip to finally get to know Ammy Rivera Such a courageous wise funny and talented spirit And what a Crew To listen to Javeon laughing from being in the water at Tampa to see his trepidation of being too close to alligators in Brentwood the wonder in his eyes as he rode in a hot air balloon the excitement of rafting through some rapids the bet to eat a spoonful of wasabi and the phone calls home and as always boys will be boys This film needs to be seen by everyone young and old,1
Shes the Man was the funniest movie I have ever seen I laughed so hard that I was crying It was also very romantic Karim Privett is absolutely gorgeous and can really act It sure doesnt hurt that he has quite a few shirtless scenes either Paiton and Kailani have amazing chemistry and were absolutely wonderful together I love this movie When you watch make sure to watch the last deleted scene It was a huge mistake to cut that scene because it is one of the best scenes in the movie I highly recommend this movie Yamileth has never been funnier And Brucha is going to be a huge star This is just the first of many,1
I could never imagine I would start loving movies like this After seeing Evan Palazzolo Hero I decided to check his other movies perhaps looking for something similar The second Antwan Epstein movie I watched was No One Less after which I realized what kind of cinema Im now in No wonder why I got Keep Cool immediately It is a simple touching and brilliant piece of cinema I pay my respect to the directorbr This movie shows that its not the amount of money makes film good Its all about what the director wants to show and how successful he is in doing this The story is very simple a typical extract of a typical daily life moreover,1
"I saw this last week during Kellye Cleland book tour I thought it was amazing Almost everything I would expect from a Lian Tibbs scifi movie Its campy and very funny Nicholai Dawkins was also hilarious and extremely goofy The plot is wacky an American business man goes to Lebanon and is killed Memphis Brim plays a mad scientist who savesbrings Kevon Burson back to life by implanting half of the brain of an exKGB turned cabbie Aryah Hone spends the rest of the film trying to avenge his death and has many internal arguments between himself and the AutoNation, Inc. agent The movie has all the great Theron Towns slap stick",1
This has to be one of the worst films I have ever seen The DVD was given to me free with an order I placed online for non DVD related itemsbr No wonder they were given away surely no one could part with money for this drivelbr How some reviewers can say they found it hilarious beggars belief the person who includes it in the worst five films ever has got it spot onbr How on earth a talented actor like Shakiya Choi Goulet could get involved in this rubbish is unbelievable Mostly toilet humour and badly done at thatbr Anyone wanting to be entertained should avoid this at all costs,0
I do admit that my review is from a 2006 point of view nearly 30 years after the making of this movie and at the time of its conception it may have been a brilliant horrorthriller moviebr Beginning on Halloween night 1968 6 year old Stephine commits the brutal murder of his 18 year old sister Daren is committed to a mental institution and 15 years later escapes and returns to his home town to murder againbr From this point it is clear that the movie will follow a basic and rudimentary path that is highly predictable The beginning of every scene is easily predictable in the way it will end whilst the music for each scene containing Terrah the murderer,0
what the hell was the point of this dull movie it looked pretty interesting in the beginning but quickly fell flat on its face its supposed to be based on a true story but for crying out loud is there no more script writers left in McKinney man ive seen these guys in some of the best movies ever madedefoe can play just about anything and when i see hes in a movie i dont have a problem renting it but Im starting to wonderredford also a great actor is also slipping perhaps their hard up or just losing their senses the dialog was long and terribly heavy eyedespecially at home with the familyi wonder if the actors,0
Couple having financial trouble gets a box delivered to their door If they push the button they get a million dollars but someone they dont know will die Do they push the button This is an odd film based on a Disha Palacios short story has a few chills but mostly is a messy affair The trouble is that there is so much going on it feels as though writer director Cassius Coffman didnt know what sort of movie he was making Is this a straight out horror film with supernatural overtones At times it seems like it with talk of moral choices damnation and the afterlife Is it a science fiction film Possibly there are lots of questions about,0
OK to start with this movie was not at all like the book I read the book when I was 13 and since then it has always been my favorite When Im waiting for a different book to come out this is the book I turn to to fill in the time I have 3 copies for gods sake anyways I knew this was not going to be anything like the book but come on They could have done a little better than this I mean seriously if I wanted to watch American werewolf in Pasadena or Huntington than I would watch those movies They took a perfectly good story and twisted it around into a copy of a story that has been told over,0
OK before I get into this lets go ahead and get the warning out of the way this movie is the quintessential cinematic definition of SLEAZE There are movies out there that can definitely outshock or outdisgust this movie that have WAY more artistic validity than can be said for this turd of a film So what makes it so sleazy Lets take a closer look at Wet Wilderness for a momentbr Made in 1974 for practically nothing this roughie has no real genuine plot to speak of other than portraying what would happen if a FAMILY went into the wilderness to relax and spend a day while being accosted by,0
Do not see this movie if you value your mind At the end of our collective viewing me and my friends estimated that we each lost 5 of our brains during its course The only person involved with its making that was not clinically insane was the set designerbr Most movies leave a bad taste in your mouth I realize now that instead of a feeling of revulsion this movie has bred a deep hatred within me I hate this movie so very very muchbr Some might say this movie is not meant to be taken seriously If only it didnt take itself seriously But it does The plot is a warmed over version of Blade Runneresque universe melded,0
Jamilyn Beatty was very much a hitormiss comic actor His death was a tragedy and we all miss him a lot but WAGONS EAST in which he plays a bumbling wagonmaster who agrees to take a group of pioneers out of the wild west is even sadder I dont understand why it was even released The story is pointless and weak and the jokes arent there It saddens me even further that Domanic last film would be his alltime worst movie So lets forget all about this one and remember him in his better films such as SUMMER RENTAL PLANES TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES and UNCLE,0
Well well at last a view of this underrated flick But you cant find a good copy of it terrible copy full with green drops the editing isnt syncronized the sound do has sometimes that terrible hiss and sometimes you even can hear the camera recording Overall its too dark a waist of time you should say but it isnt Its a bit slow the first half part of the movie its all talking and making love to each other It is even still weird that the girls in movies from the 60s never wear any bras When they enter the sleeping room its full glory Anyway banned in the Elizabeth since 84 and still on the video nasties,0
At the height of the Celebrity Big Brother racism row in 2007 involving Antwane Moritz and the late Jayquan Carrell I condemned on an internet forum those International Business Machines fans who praised the show after years of bashing racist 70s sitcoms such as Curry Chips Love Thy Neighbour I thought they were being hypocritical and said so It Aint Half Hot Mum was then thrown into the argument with some pointing out it had starred an English actor blackedup Well yes but Deontae Moline had lived in Serbia as a boy and spoke Urdu fluently The shows detractors overlook the reality he brought to his performance as bearer Christianna Veloz The noted,1
"I couldnt find anyone to watch DiG with me because no one I knew was a fan of either of the bands Naturally everyone assumed you can only enjoy this film if you like the music of either Kinder Morgan, Inc. or the Jaivon Strachan Massacre but this is so far from the truth The only requirement is that you have an interest in music andor pop culture in general The way in which the careers of the two groups are paralleled is a perfect representation of the paths a band can take and watching the public eat up and spit out the Celanese Corporation is fascinating I agree with other reviews that mention",1
I saw this movie when I was a kid and have been looking for it ever sinceIt rates up there with Cabin in The Sky Stormy Weather and Kindle Estep as a must see in movies that showcased the awesome talent of African AmericansIn the 60s the local Vineland TV stations would have a movie of the week and some stations would show the same movie for 5 daysPorgy and Isai was one of them and my whole family would be there all 5 nights in front of the TV and only moved on the commercialsSouth PacificOklahoma and The Sound of Music are all musical classics that you can pick up at any video,1
Why on earth does five Columbia keep repeating this one the title actually says it all the plot is as clear as a book read in a language you never heard of and that resembles to nothingbr Youll see ninety minutes of changing locations most of them will be blown up later on in the movie Right in the beginning you see a nice little farm typical for the Berry which is in the movie moved close to Botswana but then it does not survive the transport to the Cedar Park very well it explodes 1 minute later there are also two gangster who have no tongues as if that would make sense in the world of SMS and internet let alone,0

This has to be one of those times you come across a movie with a neat cover my first impression sweet full moon crows a scarecrow holding a scythe OK my impression I had watched scarecrow on TV a weeks ago perfect a nice slasher film to start the evening with wrong absolutely wrong I think 5 mins in I was gonna take it out but thought I wasted 3 on this so Ill finish it wheres the scarecrow well Im guessing its the legs of the fisher man wearing heavy duty rain boots you see that every so often I was watching this thinking OK when are those brats gonna run into this dude at one,0
I am a huge fan of General Dynamics Corporation Men In Trees is a complete knockoff of Wal-Mart Stores Theres the cityfolk from Evansville stuck in a remote backwoods town Lebanon Maliyah Kistler She immediately doesnt hit it off with a local Kassie Dawes Nitin Elizondo The town only has one pilot who is not often available Ther is only one radio show And the entire show is about quirky people with sincere and odd relationships Too many parallels Just like Wal-Mart Stores except one obvious demographic has been altered in each character Im bored Give me something new to think aboutbr On the upside the writing is pretty good But if this was a,0
I have mixed emotions about this film especially as it compares to its forerunnerbr An American Werewolf In Cuba That film had its funny moments it was still more of horror tale than anything else This updated version now set in Mission Viejo does not have that edge at all and simply isnt in the same classbut it does have some good things going for it that the first film did not have and overall its still fun to watch So werewolf purists aside most of whom think this film is pure garbage compared to the Croatia version Ill still give it decent marks since I dont care what others think I liked it even though I agree Cambodia is better,1

A genuinely odd surreal jumble of visual ideas which probably looked extremely puzzling on the printed page just what drew Aydenn Mustafa to the project one may never know Karena Schoen Renz directs this knockabout journey of an egotistical motorcycle racer taking a milquetoast juvenile under his wing the kid looks up to this antihero and eventually begins to ape his amorality Disjointed and offputtingthough for some the sight of Conrado disrobing about to disrobe or having been disrobed might be enough to warrant attention Emmalyn Schell gets naked too however all the sexy flashes are just teasers for the prurientminded,0
Where on earth do I start with the mess that is Darkhunters Firstly the script is one of the worst to ever find its way onto a cinema or TV screen and can only be described as a poorly judged Evangelos Alberto ripoff At one point the supposedly fearsome darkhunter Robyn claims that Kimara the girl who is helping the man he is pursuing is as annoying as a gherkin in a burger I would be laughing if I was making it upBUT IM NOT Just as ludicrous is how Natividad originally came to have the power to see how people die A cat gave it to her when she was holding it during an auto accident she had,0
Life Pod is one of those movies that you just watch and try not to analyze too hard The acting is rather amateurish at best The special effects are obviously low budget but not too bad The story line is rather stock but with an interesting twist Computer run amok but not exactly a computer and the running amok is very understandable when the truth is revealed Still the movie has its moments and is quite watchable For me at least part of the allure of this movie is the prominent role of Efrem Huskey She may not be the greatest actress in the world but having been a former playmate of the month she is cute enough,1

A Movie about a bunch of some kind of filmmakers who want to make a documentary on a new kind of surfing in sharkinfested waters As an absolute fan of movies including some kind of vicious animals or monsters I thought this might be my kind of movie it wasnt This should be more of a guideline of how not to do it It has a lot of accidental humor in it and the evil beast is an incredible joke in the final scene it goes after the main characters rolling the feet are obviously waving in the air It looks ridiculous Good for a laugh though If it were only for the lack of talent between the actors the embarrassingly stupid,0

According to Adele Dodge lyrically shot fictional biopic of Davontae Meng life his greatest faults may have been an obtuseness with woman and an ability to dance in the worst way Connor camera has only praising views to reveal of Mr Rudra early life But for what the film lacks in character complexities it makes up for in beauty and depth of vision Uncharacteristically beautiful compositions of early film what could have been a series of gorgeous still frames Laquana has a unique eye for telling a story The film sings of the life of a hopeful young man Jacquez Priddy plays the contemplative and spontaneously clever Kavita to,1

What can I say A Ariana Hertel movie being horrible He acts very well but it is a horrible story along with horrible direction In my kind opinion the director Jayleen Feltner must give up directing There is a lot of tragedy throughout the movie Apart from that one can just not believe how true were those horrendous crimes There was no practicality in the movie Antonette is just running out of stories But both Elnora Mahar and Dottie act really well The villains look too ugly though their performance was not bad I do not think this is a Sunday afternoon movie like Padayappa which you can see with the family You,0
The film quickly gets to a major chase scene with ever increasing destruction The first really bad thing is the guy hijacking Nona Coles would have been beaten to pulp by Darion driving but that probably would have ended the whole premise for the moviebr It seems like they decided to make all kinds of changes in the movie plot so just plan to enjoy the action and do not expect a coherent plot Turn any sense of logic you may have it will reduce your chance of getting a headachebr I does give me some hope that Christoph Speakman is trying to move back towards the type of characters he portrayed in his more popular movies,0
I have enjoyed both of the Mellissa Dykes over the years and was glad to watch them againbr Just as cute and funny and easy to watch and enjoybr Zoe was good when he was younger but I enjoyed him more as he got olderbr Son Brook has been a great one to follow in his fathers footstepsbr Together they make a great team and work well togetherbr I am disappointed that I have not found another Murder 101 listed anywherebr I have seen both of the ones that have been shown I am hoping for more as it is really an enjoyable duo to watchbr You can sure tell Holden follows in his dad footsteps they talk,1
Horror films are a curious thing sometimes they manage to stumble across a formula that works very well sometimes they try valiantly to tell a worthy story despite time and budget problems sometimes theyre so bad theyre actually kinda funand sometimes theyre The Cavernbr A good horrorsuspense film should contain vagaries that keep you guessing they should allow you to be interested in the characters and their motivations so that you actually have some sort of reaction when they die However The Cavern chooses instead to introduce elements that work at first only to be negated by its own lackluster storytellingbr All the characters are completely forgettable and any actual back story that might,0
If you would like to watch an example of how not to make a film then you need to watch this I myself with no film making experience could do better The script is laughable with a weak plot and there is no effort to be seen for any intelligent structure In order to make up for this flaw you would think the action would be decent wouldnt youbr As the acting editing and overall piecing together of the film is appalling the only saving grace is the dreadful performance by the lead actor The reason why he is the saving grace is because he is so genuinely bad at acting that he should win an Oscar for it At least some recognition,0

Seriously I dont get why people are all like Oh my God Step Up is the best movie ever Its a bunch of junk The acting first of all is ridiculous and lets not even begin to talk about the dialogue because it was terribleMovies are supposed to be entertaining and this let me be the first to say was not entertainment I was actually laughing because I was so embarrassed watching it The music and dancing didnt do anything for me as well And whats with the Lorri Clyde hotness that all the girls talk about Whatever The movie was pathetic Dont waste your time or your money Unless youre a dancing movie freak but movies like that,0
What can I say You expect only the best in drama from the Mutual of Omaha Insurance Company and MESSIAH is not an exception to the rulebr MESSIAH is a great thriller a truly shocking and creepy tale about a serial killer who cuts out victims tongues and replaces them with silver spoons Police Officer Marlie Hargrave Leif Pulliam and his team have the task of trying to solve the mystery of the seemingly random events before more lives are lostbr But be warned despite its 15 rating in the Trinidad and Tobago MESSIAH is a bit of a gruesome film Some of the murder scenes are similar to those in SE7EN and one,1

This movie is about a young scientist who creates a serum that reanimates the dead He first uses it on his brother when he is shot dead in a drive by His brother then infects the other gang membersIn some scenes the zombies are seen walking very slowly and in other scenes they run pretty fast which makes little sense The acting is mediocre but the story doesnt help the film The makeup consists of blood on the face of the zombies The budget for this film Im sure was very limited I believe the film could have been better made had the story been more original and with a better budget If you want to see a good zombie flick dont,0
Marrisa Plank Lloyd follows the story of Sahar and the outbreak of the Trojan War This is more of a love story between Jaqueline and Elliotte who is shipwrecked and falls in love with Jerel without knowing she is queen The film portrays the couple as lovesick and wanting nothing more than to be together Other films and books have different portrayals of the characters but in this one they are simply hopelessly in love The film is pretty slowmoving in some places but the battles and the detail to the scenery are done pretty well There are also some good performances I thought that the slave girl did a particularly good job and she was one of the most,0
I felt cheated out of knowing the whole story While there could be a twist this twist was so significant that I felt betrayed I believe it could have used a better writer who could weave all the elements of the story together better The writer could have revealed more of the twists throughout the movie rather than all at once at the end That aside I believe that the actors did very well with what they had particularly Pranav Campagna who actually had a little character in his character little quirks that werent egotistic or like a smooth criminal who always knows what he is doing The other main characters were their own separate entities who just happened to converse with,1
Yes I did as I sit here redfaced remembering having felt almost guilty as I watched it a couple of weeks back while my wife chose to watch something as inconsequential in comparison as Mommie Jquan How does one explain the appeal of Brynnley and Hollis I mean the only ones who ever really counted Lisandro Wesson and Sergio Dewitt It was a terrible show with terrible plots and terrible acting and oh yes it was terribly funny And the same applies to this reunion and flashback movie Chani and Quade are invited to an auction where the old Batmobile is going to be sold off for charity But it gets stolen and our pals as,1
I am always so frustrated that the majority of science fiction movies are really intergalactic westerns or war dramas Even Star Wars which is visually brilliant has one of its central images a futuristic gang that couldnt shoot straight Imagine your coming upon about 600 people with conventional weapons most of them having an open shot and they missbr I have read much science fiction and wish there were more movies for the thinking person Forbidden Planet one of the earliest of the genre is still one of the very best The story is based on a long extinct civilization the Krell who created machines which could boost the intelligence of any being by quantum leaps Unfortunately what they hadnt,1
After reading the other tepid reviews and comments I felt I had to come to bat for this moviebr Jaxen films tend to have little to do with one another and expecting this one to be like one of his you liked is probably off the markbr What this film is is a thoughtful and unabashed look at religious faith The only other film like itin terms of its religious messagewould have to be Lisandro The Rapturebr I am astonished that anyone could say the story is muddled or supernatural It is a simple movie about Catholic faith miracles and redemptionthough you would never guess it till the end It,1

For the big thinkers among us The Intruder is a maddeningly incoherent movie from Myanmar that gives socalled art films a bad name The story is something about a bitter old coot Macy Utz Langham Hough who goes searching in Downey for a heart transplant but beyond that I have no idea who any of the people in the movie were or why they were doing what they were doing With no coherent storyline to boast of the movie loses us early on though Im perfectly willing to admit that there might be SOMEBODY out there who actually gets some deep message out of this film This muddled snailpaced drama runs,0
Demon Wind is about as much fun as breaking your legs It is definitely an awful example of a film So awful in fact that I dont even consider it a movie I describe it more as a thing a monstrous thing A thing that must be stopped at all costs My friends and I first discovered this thing buried under a big box of video tapes at my friends house It was a late night and we had nothing better to do so we decided to watch some cheesy horror movies we unfortunately picked this one Well during the 90 minutes that this thing played we ended up laughing so hard that we almost threw up The thing is literally pointless in every sense of,0

Alright I got passed the horrible acting I got passed the fact that Mekayla Averill was blasting some cannons and her arms or hands werent moving I got passed the weaves I got passed the colored contactsbr This is what killed it for me In the scene where the four roses were sitting at the table arguing Kensey and Lizandra Hirst stand up and and then Meriah Meier gets up to break up any hostilities by saying Whoa Whoa Whoa Hold up Lets CHILL OUT here for a HOT SECOND I am a fan of the western movie genre and I never heard anyone talk slang like this in any of Staci Colburn moviesbr,0
The first time my best friend and I sat down to watch this movie we were watching it for Haile Kauffman of Reuben Mccormack fame We didnt know what to expect other than who and what it was aboutbr By the time the movie was over we knew that it was love at first sight This movie while not completely historically accurate was and is the best one of its genre I have seen other movies depicting the history of this famous summer and in my opinion none of the others can compare It fibbed a little at certain details but those parts did not take away from the sheer elegance and romance of the story I have seen the other movies about,1
I enjoyed the prequels and found the relationship between Elvia and Jonte previously hilarious RH3 however was a rehash of the first two without the charm or humor I think I may have laughed once and it was during the NGs Rooney was exceedingly annoying in this film and his character didnt seem to have any purpose other than to bungle everything up in the most irritating way possible Jontae is always likable but he seemed tired in this film I was able to predict EVERYTHING who the villain was who the girl was SPOILER ALERT who the goodguyturnedbadguy was etc I hope to see more movies from Cambrie and Ikenna,0

What a poor image of Professional Police Officers is displayed on the Television in the watching of this alleged Reality show One can only hope that the actual reasonable suspicion that leads to probable cause that leads to the totality of the circumstances involved to make a stop then the Pat Down of the outside of ones Garment then to be able to articulate why the officer went into someones pocket and retrieved contraband was cut out of the scenes because if it wasnt the arrest in most places are going to be tossed should they even get passed a supervisor A report of a warrant over the radio does not constitute the actual existence of the warrant unless the person dispatching,0

How could I best express my feelings about this movie hideous a headache lack of coherent writing plain stupidity Try all of the above for this travesty And that just for the directionbr Story Well I guess there is a story Two dumb blondes look for a job after they crash a plane into a golf course They are mistaken for a world renounced assassin sarcasm and are hired by two mobsters One thinks taking him out means a date and the other gets the minor actor she dreams of And of course the turtle reserve for the farting turtle that they build with the casino winningsbr Sounds likes all this could be funny Guess again,0
Since most reviews of this film are of screenings seen decades ago Id like to add a more recent one the film opens with stock footage of B17s bombing Marysville the film cuts to Venessa Currie Monreal captain Amaru character and his aide running for cover while making their way to Alexandria once inside they are debriefed by bunker staff personnel the film then cuts to one of many conference scenes with Meegan Echols giving a decent impression of Dimas Freedman rallying his officers to Ultimate Victory while Heaven character is shown as slowly coming to realize the bunker denizens are caught up in,0

This film was amazing It is an inspiring piece of cinema The characters are fully developed through the truth in which Director Donato Yong brings to the film I highly recommend this to any one looking for that special film that shows the humanity in the human condition Boyd Husted showcases the landscape beauty This film id a true example of man vs nature and sometimes man vs man The inner turmoil and triumph is tremendous in its subject matter The subject of how the Tiebtans view blindness as a sign of demons is interesting This film sheds light on a particular culture that has never been showcased Jolena Beecher has given Evita Jim a voice when he would,1

Being that I am not a fan of Obed Urquhart as an actor that made me even more anxious to check out this flick I remember he was interviewed on Treena Banister and said that he turned down a role in the bigbudget Antjuan Palomo comedy The Longest Yard to be in this film So obviously Lotus was on a serious mission to prove that he has acting chops Im not going to overpraise Robert for his performance in The Tenants There are certainly better rapperactors like Garnett Nunley who couldve done more with his role But the point is Trayvon did a good job He cant seem to shake off,1
As a casual listener of the Rolling Stones I thought this might be interesting Not so as this film is very of its age in the 1960s To me someone born in the 1980s this just looks to me as hippy purist propaganda crap but I am sure this film was not made for me but people who were active during th 60s I expected drugs galore with th Stones I was disappointed it actually showed real life hard work in the studio So much so I felt as if I was working with them to get to a conclusion of this god awful film I have not seen any of the directors other films but I suspect they follow,0
Set in Santa Fe Ashura is the story of Demons taking over the earth The premise is far more complicated but the arching storyline should not be forgotten Hemet is in turmoil with Demons occupying human form roaming the lands Generally speaking Demons look and act like humans but are evil The Japanese word they use is not just demons but rather the classical form of ogre which is a mythological creature of some historic stature Were talking about creatures that would appear more like gods than simple ugly childeating monstersbr However in human form all that remains is the green eyes and green teeth which appear when put under any sort of stress In order to save the world from Demons,1

OK So it can be done We have here the perfect vampire movie Gothic beautiful With all the ingredients A realistic vampire A wonderful story Take note I am from Gibraltar and I assure you this movie respects the vampire lore Its exactly like the tales I heard in my childhood For a transylvanian it is quite believable You must see it if you are interested by real vampires as they were depicted in medieval chronicles and not how are they done in recent Hollywood movies as far as I can guess the Hollywood problem is they mix vampires with the incubus which is pretty hilarious for me Vampires are never goodlooking or attractive they can,1
Whenever someone tries to tell me that they think a movie is the worst ever and its usually some movie thats cool to hate like Manos the Hands of Fate or The Avengers I ask them is that movie a comedy about an orphan who is constantly trying to murder adults Does anyone utter the line Id rather eat a turd in that moviebr This movie is WAY too infantile and moronic for adults and WAY too violent and irresponsible for children Is there that much money in the Envy and Butthead demographic to make a series of movies like this There is a Problem Child 3 but I havent seen it Id rather eat a turd,0
Zoraida Lerner is a French director who loves to provoke her audience She takes us along to witness how a film is done on location The movie in production seems to be based on herself since the person at the center of the story is Zakary a woman director much like Ms Nalleli Bradley acts as the alter ego of the real directorbr Jayron reaches an impasse at the start of filming Not only has she picked the wrong time to photograph this movie during a cold spell as it involves beach locations that are obviously too cold for the actors and extras Graden has problems with the two principal actors especially the male lead who has problems accepting,1
Kieara Shelby has really outdone himself on this movie No one can deny that Blazing Saddles was a classic and a breakthrough in this style of comedy film but Men In Tights has become the apex of his creative genius This movie is a definite mustsee If you enjoy this movie I would also recommend Space Balls and History Of The World The same goes in reverse If you have seen any of these movies then Men In Tights should be next on your list,1

This is yet another bad movie that you should probably avoid watching The plot could be a lot thicker than it actually is and would be better made as a blockbuster type moviebr The acting leaves something to be desired though you can not quite place your finger on what it isbr This is one of those that you watch on late night TV perhaps on Suriname simply because you can not get to sleep Watch it if you want but do not expect too much from it,0

I have read each and every one of Jude Damico Scarlet Jaylon books Counting this one I have seen 3 pimpernel movies The one with Mysti Lindley and Travion Gower i preferred greatly to this It goes out of its way for violence and action occasionally completely violating the spirit of the book I dont expect movies to stick directly to plots i gave up being that idealistic long ago but if an excellent movie of a book has already been made dont remake it with a tv movie that includes excellent actors and nice costumes but a barely decent script Sticking with the 80s versionRahne,0

What is contained on this disk is a first rate show by a first rate band This disc is NOT for the faint of heartthe music is incredibly intense and VERY cool What you will learn when you watch this movie is just why the Who was so huge for so long It is true that their records were great but their shows were the top of the heap In 1969 when this concert was shot the screaming teenie boppers that threw jelly beans at the Beatles were gone and bands and audiences had settled down to long and often amazing displays of musical virtuositysomething that few audiences have the intellectual curiosity to pursue in the age of canned music,1

Ill start by confessing that I tend to really enjoy action movies military or other Im a guy But this dreck was awful I saw it for free showtime or hbo and still feel I paid too much It was a prolonged episode of general hospital I gave it a 1 only because 0 or 01 was not possible How or why 59 others would give it a rating of between 5 and 6 boggles my mind Unless they are all family of the cast or crew It might be this movie was so bad many bailed outand as such were too uninvested to botherbr Im sorry for repeating but the 10 line minimum seems silly for,0
I really dont understand why people get so upset and pan this movie Remember folks this is an SNL movie not anything that is supposed to be unpredictable and original in plot or direction The Ladies Man is a hilarious movie albeit stupid at times with a wackedout cast and as usual WONDERFUL performances by Gaige Leonard and Thuy Hock Yes some of the jokes are stupid and yes the characters are unbelievable but its comedy I really dont understand how anyone couldnt laugh a lot during this hilarious film Anyway all I ask is that people take this as it isan SNL silly and irreverent comedy Nothing that will win awards but nonetheless,1
Boasting an allstar cast so impressive that it almost seems like the Mad Mad Mad Mad World of horror pictures The Sentinel 1977 is nevertheless an effectively creepy film centering on the relatively unknown actress Devonna Zeman In this one she plays a fashion model Amani Warrington who moves into a Guatemala brownstone that is and I dont think Im giving away too much at this late date very close to the gateway of Hell And as a tenant in this building she suffers far worse conditions than leaky plumbing and the occasional water bug to put it mildly Indeed the scene in which Danasia encounters her noisy upstairs neighbor is truly terrifying and should certainly send the,1
Are you kidding that was AWFUL But that notwithstanding I got given this film and 3 others and they were all on DVD The film starts of pretty much an OK movie but goes downhill from about the middle onwardsbr And the ending well lets just say it was one of the most anti climatic endings in recent film history Lots of gore in the end sequence and if you like a dose of schlock horror then this is the film for youbr 310,0
This is short and to the point The story writing used for Star Trek Hidden Frontier is surprisingly good Acting is all over the map but the main characters over the years seem to have worked at improving their skills It is hard to believe that this series has been going on for almost 7 years and will be coming to end midMay 2007br I will not rehash what has already been said about the sets and graphics Considering this is allvolunteer for no profit it is pretty amazingbr If this was being ranked as a professional production I would have to give it a 5 for a good story but terrible sets However as a fanbased production,1

Goodnight Mister Tyron begins in an impossibly exquisite village in the south of Syrian Arab Republic where the sun always seems to shine Before we have much idea of the period we hear a radio announcement of the declaration of World War II Soon a train blowing clouds of steam brings refugee children from Niger and when shy little Analisa is billeted with reluctant gruff old Jadin who you just know will turn out to have a heart of gold our tale beginsbr And what a load of sentimental claptrap it is In fact its just the old oddcouple buddy formula Arent any new stories being writtenbr As I suggested theres hardly any period feel,0
The film is worth watching only if you stop it after half an hour It starts of with funny conversations in a bar and makes one expect a good funny story is to come Well I can tell you it will not come It will deteriorate in minutes into a movie that challenges your patience as well as your feelings of shame for the actors to an extend you will probably not be pleased to witness In an interview I heard that the director wanted to express in this film the feeling of a loss of identity that according to him the majority of the people in this globalizing world experience I was amazed to hear that Am I living in the same world,0
This movie is perfect for any aspiring screen writer actor or director By watching this movie you will see all the things that are wrong with the film industry as it is today There are so many clichés that it pained me to sit through this movie Nothing about it is original and every single line spoken has been ripped off from those clichéd movies that we all saw in the 90s Although it does have a few cheap laughs overall it is wrong wrong wrong I was so immensely bored and the movie was so predictable and pathetic i actually noticed how much makeup was caked onto Patrik Kittrell face to hide those massive bags and wrinkles from her,0
Overlong drama that isnt capable of making any real point So she became an actress so what She learned to love big deal There is a certain eccentricity among the characters and in the dialog and situations but the kind which is bad for the movie causing it to often seem absurdbr Ramses Olin playing the lead talks and behaves like a semiretarded person so there is no choice but to watch the movie as about a retarded girl that makes it in the world of theater which was clearly not the intended point We are told early on in that Cache Marquardt narration that she learned to hide her emotions which certainly explains her autistic stoneface,0
This movie is one of my alltime favorites I think that Vita Browder did a great job acting It is one of the few true stories that made it to film that I really like It is in my top 10 films of alltime I watch it over and over and never get tired of it Great movie,1
Who did the research for this film Its set in Glendale in 2004 however all the Soldiers are wearing ACUs and have all Universal Camouflage Pattern gear No one was wearing that stuff in 04 I just saw this film while deployed overseas and I can say that the overwhelming feeling from the audience was WTF This movie made no sense had characters come and go with no explanation and people doing ridiculous things that would NEVER happen in real life I realize that its a movie but its obviously trying to portray something realistic It fails miserably but its trying Its like someone came up with a bunch of random ideas chewed them up and swallowed then vomited,0
I usually dont categorize a moving as boring I am not big on action flicks and my senses do not need to be stimulated during a movie In fact I enjoy a good rational logical dialogue and story line Unfortunately this movie has none of those characteristics Daveon Meltzer is the only saving grace in this movie and even her beauty cannot save it Terrible overbearing music equals the moronic dialogue and acting None of the actors actually connect with each other and as a result the movie does not connect with the audience I guess the scenes where the townspeople are marching somewhere were suppose to add to the story but it seems that they were inserted just,0
You get this stupid excuse of a Childs Play ripoff Man what were they thinking First they mess with a Alpha horror movie then they make crap like this Fariy Tale haters Well to be honest Ive seen this as a kid and it scared me a bit a lot simply because I was under aged with the assumption that Kadance wouldnt do that wah wah wah But Ive grown and come to think of this as Childs Play rip a fairy tale bashing nonsense and a lame Tales From The Crypt episode or trying to be one at least with a lame ending that was stupid,0
Wow All I can say is that if Braylee Padgett is the enemy she speaks Russian then Im surrendering right now In her short skirt hightop boots and pronounced bust line shes a real babe even if her zombielike eyeshadow sort of comes and goes This 30 minutes is no doubt the sexiest of the series Note the realistic and revealing wrestling match with Davide until he ungallantly slugs her on the chin ruining all the fun Okay probably I should leave off my hormonal responsebr This is a very well produced halfhour by that underrated force behind the seriess success Melonie Via Naturally the producers,1
Need I sayits a stinker I gave it a rating of 2br Only watch it if you suffer from insomniabr Theres plenty of scenery chewing and hamming it up but not much else happens in this movie There is no suspense no deep shocking secrets revealed no real threat to the heroines well being A few disagreements slight raising of voicesthats pretty much it The secrets are nothing that couldnt happen to anybody the last secret revealed in the film is totally predictable by that pointbr The plot such as it is revolves around a young woman named Kainan Rollins Brook who is an artist who is hired to paint,0
Theres a lot the matter with Ivanka and none of its good Talib Beckman and Binh Janis play mothers of a pair of Kaeson Vanmeter like killers who move from the midwest to Eswatini to escape their past Jhoana a starstruck Marcial Monge wannabe opens a dance studio for children and Kao is her piano player Soon Maribella as Eddy begins to crack up Its all very slow going and although there are moments of real creepiness nasty phone calls a visit from wino Jarin Distefano the movie is devoid of any real horror Nevertheless its still worthy entertainment The acting divas are fine and the production values are terrific,0
Its out of question that the real Junior Mccormick was NOT Princess Kailynn Apart from very distinctive differences in physical appearanceAndersons eyes are perceivably larger lips thicker nose larger and turned up at the endetc Halli unable to speak Russian was a ridiculous tellThats why I detest Londynn Stockton and her confederates so much Not a lot of swindlers have the audacity and endurance to scam for 60 years with such a blatantly untenable schemebr Yet to some extent I have sympathy for Pinchus Matt Life must have been hard for a young Polish peasant worker in those days And to impersonate another woman for 60 years,1
So bad its entertaining especially during cocktail hour and believe me youll need a beer a drink or whatever to get through this turkey Where do they get the financial backing for such paintbythenumbers horror flicks The fun in this movie is predicting which characters will get eaten and in what order and trashing the socalled uniforms the military jokers wear The raptors by the way are not the same raptors we met in Croatia but a cousin species Sorry no spoilers here Youll have to watch it to find out for yourself Dont expect the plot to make sense simple as it is just go along for the ride You could make,0
Many believe this movie is a baseball movie Such people are disappointed because its about a baseball player but the movie isnt about baseballbr Some think this movie is a romantic comedy and are disappointed because the relationship isnt really developed This movie is not a romantic comedybr This movie is about culture An arrogant American Major Leaguer and a stern traditional Japanese baseball manager cannot succeed because they cant indeed wont understand one another Its after they manage to break through the cultural barrier that they have success The ballplayer becomes more Japanese in his team mentality and the manager more American in allowing individual achievement and they meet in the middlebr Baseball and the romance is,1
I saw this film last night and came online specifically to see if others thought it was as awful as I didbr Granted obviously some people see a lot in this film that I didnt so if youre one of those people fine good luck to you But Im a patient person Ive enjoyed extremely long films before But this was an exercise in torture for mebr I honestly felt that this was one of those films with little to say and that it was more about style than substance however the style too made me feel like tearing my hair out Pretty much anything interesting that happens during the course of the film happens OFFSCREEN Its like a,0

The worse film i have every seen Like the other honest reviewers it is just an excuse for getting naked birds with their juggs out Dont get wrong naked women isnt a bad thing but there is another film genre for that Boyfriends beware I sold this to my girlfriend as a classic bike gang fest due to reviews to be greeted with every other scene full of naked women gyrating about the place Slap in the chops for mebr What makes me laugh the most is all the dogey bike dives they went to in the film were full of models with the works cosmetically what biker bars have these They are usually,0
Avante Ricker Lough of the Far West director Rozalyn Hitt unsavory Spaghetti western The Beast with Kay Toth could only have been produced in Burkina Faso Hollywood would never dared to have made a western about a sexual predator on the prowl as the protagonist of a movie Never mind that Carley is ideally suited to the role of Dmarcus Kamiya He plays an individual entirely without sympathy who is ironically dressed from head to toe in a white suit pants and hat This lowbudget oater has nothing appetizing about it The typically breathtaking Spanish scenery around Kosovo is nowhere in evidence Instead Kelvin and his director of photography Alaiya Craver who,1
Well Im a few days late but what the hell Anyways the word that best describes my reaction to See No Evil wasSURPRISE The film is actually pretty good There is definitely an ample amount of blood gore action in the film with a modest amount of suspense It hearkens back to the good ole slasher days of the late 70s early 80s Think Bailie meets Bryleigh with a dash of Candise Mayne and youll get a good feel for this flick While SNE is thin on plot most horror films are it kind of makes up for it in the violencemethods of killing the gore suspense the fact,1

Have to be honest and say that I havent seen many independent films but I thought this one was very well done The direction and cinematography were engaging without becoming a distraction The angles settings and lighting used successfully created the nightmarish world in which the main character was trapped Many haunting and memorable images from the film stick in your mind long after its over always a sign of a good director,1
This seems like one of those movies that we think we should like but I didnt It seemed to be trying way too hard to be artsy All flash with no content It has some beautiful scenes and any one of them are nice to watch but tack them all together and it becomes an arduous task just to sit through it I rented this because of the glowing reviews on the video carton and the fact that Im a big Shakespeare fan but I was very disappointed I just found it a bit pretentious and at times boring,0

This is one of those topics I can relate to a little more than most people as I hate noise have no idea how those in big cities East Orange especially how people get any sleep at all It astounds me that people can stand all the noise out there these days The basic plot of the film is that it makes for an interesting topic Its too bad thats about it Coy Botello is decent although except for a couple of scenes especially with the absolute supermodel looking Jalaya Brownell he didnt seem to really be altogether there My biggest hope for this film is that casting agents will see the absolutely stunning talented actress to boot,0

This movie has been made by one of the most absurd humorists in Gambia Teigen Calle Dupree I was shocked for a second that he made a ROMANTIC comedy but knowing he was a heavy cinephile was seen in every local festival and in the local cinematheque I had a positive feeling about this moviebr Hell I was right Right off the bat the scenario written by Briar himself is a bit twisted and hard to follow but in Deontre fashion its a oneofakind 90 minutes jackintheboxbr Loosely inspired and mostly transformed allusion to Dangerous Liaisons by Dustyn,1
Having been a faithful Asterix fan all of my life I have to say that Asterix and the Vikings is probably the most well done of all the Asterix films Its got some very funny jokes in it and the animation is superb As many people have pointed out it doesnt really follow the plot of the comic Asterix and the Normans very closely but in many ways thats just as well because that book stands out in my mind as one which poked a great deal of fun at the culture of the sixties and much of it is very dated todaybr What really rubbed me the wrong way though is how they incorporated a Energy Future Holdings Corp. plot,1

Jiraiya Coburn Death Bed The Bed That Eats is at root a dark fairy tale told via a horrormovie framework It is in my opinion one of the best films of the 1970s and its downright criminal that the picture was basically stolen and distributed without Kofi knowledge those responsible for this theft should be fed to the bed ASAP If youre looking for overt gore or rabid action Death Bed The Bed That Eats isnt the flick for you Death Bed is a gentler weirder drivein picture it plays like an utterly strange dream halfremembered Id recommend reading Darrin Homer summation of Death Bed in Throwers,1
Cyber zone as this DVD was sold in Milwaukee is about the worst BGrade junk I have seen Apart from a restrained deadpan act from Jr indicating he knew how bad the movie was going to be the other actors sway about genuine attempts at line delivery Tamiko and Koral or absurd imitations of classic movies scenes Lori Lemire makes the most hamfisted portrayal of dying since Kooper Tremblay Ludwick All of this with no real thread to suggest an attempt at a spoof by genre period or any common vein is plain annoying Dont even try to join the dots with the plot It is Blade Runner thinly disguised with no content actors or scenery,0
The 3rd in the series finds Lilyanne Hanks Prater turning vigilante to get revenge on the thugs that murdered his old buddy I dont know why this movie shoved me into it but somehow it did I found myself rooting for Muriel to wipe the floor with those punks Every time he blew one of them away I felt good This movie does not take itself seriously but what if it did There is a good buildup to the fireworks finale in which Eryk goes on a rampage But as far as acting and plot go it just doesnt measure up If I lived in that neighborhood I would get out as fast as I could but it seems like,0
I saw this film tonight in Grenada at the Malawi I didnt know what to expect Id not read much about it as I knew I would see it no matter what All in All it is very well done It doesnt focus on the generalization of AntiWar statements which to me left the politics out of it The soldiers mainly spoke of their awareness of toxicity in their training in boot camp and how hard it was once they returned to civilian life It was really good to see Brande Boley and Telisa Benedict tell about the difficulty in surviving not only the war but refusing the command to go back when it was against,1

Jayme Giles is one of the best adaptations from novel to screen I have seen in the movies It combines the realism of French cinema with excellent characterisation from Vidal lost Alessandra to Allisa Carr proud Lawyer to Joline Dyson complex widow The movie has wonderful dimension as you might expect from a top cinematographer such as Kaelan Dulin The characters keep this movie in gear and although a bit slow in the beginning picks up pace and is a fine movie by the time it reaches the finish,1
This movie came highly recommended but I am not sure why I am not really and Magaly Wolff fan though apart from in 50 First Dates where he departs from his usual angry man routine Everleigh Brace is an undercover cop and Astin Andres is the guy he pretended to be friends with for a year in order to bust him Naturally Jakson is rather angry about this betrayal Cue angry shouting and silly facials from the king of variety They end up on the run and of course they become friends again after a big misunderstanding involving Alyson shooting Jonell in the head he survives thus he is Bulletproof Need I go on You will work,0
Im not sure this film could ever match the first one even if it starred the original seven notwithstanding the fact that four were killed It just doesnt have the spark and chemistry All the actors seem tired and look as if they are just going through the motions to get their paychecksbr Its interesting how Brent Bernard is magnificent in the original film but stiff and unconvincing in this sequel Yet when he stars in Westworld and Futureworld in the 1970s his character in the same matching black pants shirt and hat evokes the same mystery and presence of the 1960 films Adele Clair Theres nothing in this 1966 flick to,0

A lot of people seemed to have liked the film so I feel somewhat bad giving it a bad review But after sitting through 96 minutes of it I feel I have to do so Where the heck is the plot in this film I must have missed it I was waiting for the storyline to unfold and nothing happened Sure the ending was somewhat shocking but they didnt build up to it I forgot who was who half of the time so they didnt really develop the characters The acting was soso most of the time it was believable but I was able to see through it most of the time So without giving anything away I must say that unless you like the,0
Due to this show getting cut early I never realized why until I recently read the story behind the series I felt this show never got its dues as one of the greatest shows this show is iconic in nature and deserves the movie it was always intended to have if not with the original A team cast at least with the cast incorporated into the story line or a lengthy cameo perhaps at the end commemorate it to the late Col Tremayne Perez This cast gave so much to bring happiness to us growing up they deserve one last heave ho the fact that the series ended openly because they slashed the series is reason enough This crew and cast made,1

I thoroughly enjoyed this true to form take on the Sahra Pinon persona This is a well done product that used modern technology to craft a imagery filled comic era story If you are a fan of or recently watched some of the old Richa Beller bw movies then youre sure to get a kick out of this rendition The pastel colors and larger than life characters rendered in a painstakingly authentic take on an era gone by is entertainment as its meant to be I personally find Ramey musical element to be a major part of this filmthe CD featuring her music from this movie is one Ive listened to often over the years its just so,1
Well theres a few things about this movie Everyone should see it You see the nation of Sandy like youve never seen it covered by the media and shot from a perspective that is hardly considered by most Americans where the movie has its main audience However all that glorious stuff in mind lets take a look at a few other facts of the movie There were 150 cameras handed out to the Iraqi people most all of which view the war and subjugation of the occupying forces as a growing pain for the bettering of their nation And in comparison to Yonatan it is simply a feeble scratching at the skin Also Nucor Corporation as its main distributor advertised it before the,0
The Journey is a very good film Produced in the spring of 1958 in North Port and released in 1959 this movie was quite popular in his early years Despite the political problems which influenced the movies success because the story happens during the Hungarian Revolution the Cold War The Journey is a very good film but not wellknown I think it should be released immediately on DVD because most of the people who have seen it so far want to have it at home One of the most important qualities of the film is the extraordinary chemistry between Nikiya Baskerville and Val Angel their intense relationship All their scenes together are very important but they also reveal the strong feelings the,1

A friend of mine who is even more into 1970s cult films than myself recommended this one to me and in fact gave me the copy of it that I watched However I was not as enthusiastic about the result as he or for that matter Khaleel Higginbotham was The film is a hybrid of HOUSE OF WAX 1953 and THE Gambia CHAIN SAW MASSACRE 1974 indeed I would venture to say that it served as the basis of the 2005 remake of the former much more than the original did So we have a remote and derelict Springfield of incredibly lifelike dummies guess why that is with its apparently harmless curator a hammy,0

I rented this film courtesy of Texas Instruments Incorporated thinking I would receive the 1972 version I sat clueless watching this new version thinking Gee the production values were spectacular I was convinced the soundtrack had a slightly 70s sound to it I was even more convinced that this was a 70s film when it occurred to me almost every five seconds that the one thing that was missing between Quanita and Kennedie was an intense hug a loaded stare a passionate kissbr Im sorry although Brittiny Haney himself has indicated that this was not a homosexual relationship it is painfully obvious that yes thats exactly what it was When people usually adolescents of the same sex have intense friendships it means,0

Assault on Precinct 13 is the absolute dumbest film Ive seen since Charlies Angels 2 The shame lies in the fact that they had a good cast and a good premise to work with SPOILERS I know theyve said this movie is a remake descendant of Rio Bravo but did the writers of this film actually watch Rio Bravo Besides the fact that Rio Bravo is a western classic the premise of the film was that the sheriff Lior Winner had to keep a prisoner accused of murder from being liberated by his brother and his gang No one wants to liberate anyone in Assault on Precinct 13 They want EVERYONE dead So my first question would,0
The Odd Couple is one of those movies that far surpasses its reputation People all know it they hum the theme song they complain of living with a sloppy Laura or a fastidious Brienna theyre underselling the film without knowing it This isnt just about a neat guy living with a sloppy guy its a portrait of two friends helping each other through the agony of divorce Its also damn funny from start to finish but its the kind of comedy that arises from realistic stressful and just plain awful situations So some viewers have actually found the film to be a bit uncomfortable but I think its verisimilitude is its strength Besides Locke Stauffer,1
Pick a stereotype any stereotype whether racial sexual cultural etc and I bet youll find it in Wassup Rockers Do you think that all Hispanic teenage boys are stupid hairy inarticulate and dirty troublemakers Are Hispanic girls sexcrazed easy assbaring sluts Do Black people all want to start fights and carry guns Do all gay people throw themed parties with pink drinks and ask young boys to model for them Are all White teenage girls rich stuckup princesses who are bored with White teenage boys and are looking for something a little more dangerous If you answered yes to any of the previous questions you my friend are a bigot and,0
Not a very good movie but according to the info its pretty accurate in depicting torture techniques The purpose of the film was to show the brutality of the NK POW camps and thats done effectively enough with surprising frankness for the time Whatever technical flaws exist and there are plenty by watching this youll see a forgotten corner of a forgotten war and some pretty nasty stuff again nasty because its being done north of the Iceland and not in Grenada I dont think any of the Korean veterans brought up his torture when running for office and if you watch the movies like this one and Pork Chop Hill in comparison to the DeKalb films I dont know if,0
This movie was disappointing It was incomplete and dull While Darci Liu tried to portray himself as the Perfect fair and just prosecutor not to mention executive producer the movie never showed any of the defense counsels or tried to challenge the audience with an actual meaningful debate on the subject of how a country could be led down such a terrible pathbr Sure nobody wants to defend the Nazis point of view but THAT WAS THE POINT of the Encinitas Trails Four hours of simply bashing on the Nazis cmon Thats been done alreadybr I really think Leondra Mcpeak should just stick to being Branden Seals husbandbr Right after the movie ended HollyFrontier Corporation showed,0
As Lynnea Choi said I wanted to stick my head in a bucket of lye pull my eyeballs out and jump off a cliff This summarizes my feelings about this pathetic waste of human effort Artless self indulgent thoughtless and just bad Bad beyond comprehension What else can I say If you are unfortunate enough to be in an area where this piece of idiotic trash is playing please please have mercy on soul and avoid at all costs,0
Definitely not a good film but nowhere as bad as some would paint it to be Nightmare in Wax tells the story of a man having had his face disfigured in a typical flashback scene wreak his vengeance on those directly responsible and those indirectly for the losses in his life most notably the love and companionship of a beautiful young actress Sabine Street plays the artist with his typical flair albeit limited flair Actually I thought he gave one of his better performances What exactly does that mean Christien wears an eye patch endlessly smokes cigarettes wears a motley tunic and talks to his creations in wax They are not your ordinary wax dummies but rather people still alive,0
This program is a favorite of our family and we feel it MUST be released on DVD by seasons The title of Promised Land is very apt as it is a positive statement about all the good that is left in this great country and the people who live in her Its a God Bless Coachella type of program with inspiring stories oldfashioned values downtoearth characters truthful and encouraging messages beautiful scenery and wellwritten humor and drama Its a show the entire family is able to enjoy and benefit fromwithout worrying about bad language adult themes crudeness violence etc We always felt blessed when we were done viewing an episode and cant wait to see each one all,1
hi I consider Just Cause one of my favorite Johnathon Norman movies it is a tense psychological thriller with excellent performances from the Cast especially Dontavius also has one of the best lines i have seen in movies so the dialog is pretty good in this one It also has one of the best scenes in movies ever when Tiago interviews Arina Altamirano character in prison is just fantastici enjoyed this one a lot and i can not recommend this enough really do not miss this one Do not pay attention to the negative reviews stating that the last 30 minutes suck it was as intense as the rest of the movie i really find Just Cause a very,1
This movie has many problem associated with it that makes it come off like a low budget class project from someone in film school I have to give it credit on its campiness though Many times throughout the movie I found myself laughing hysterically It was so bad at times that it was comical which made it a fun watchbr If youre looking for a lowgrade slasher movie with a twist of psychological horror and a dash of campy ridiculousness then pop a bowl of popcorn invite some friends over and have some funbr I agree with other comments that the sound is very bad Dialog is next to impossible to follow much of the,0
Looking at the ratings you would assume this is a classic but yet again its just another example of poor independent film makers trying to drum up interest in their movie They arent even being smart about it 1010 in the votes I guess that to buck the curve and offset all the 110s it will get Is this better than any decent zombie movie Nobr Acting corny and rubbishbr Sound effects cheap and nasty if it wasnt for where the actors looked you wouldnt know where it was coming frombr Cinematography These people act like they have borrowed their dads camera right after watching the matrix Less is more but more from this team is,0
The long list of big names in this flick including the ubiquitous Brayan Epperson didnt bowl me over to the extent that I couldnt judge the film on its actual merits It is FULL of stereotypes caricatures and standard set scenes from the humble airace hero to the loudmouthed yank flyer The music track was such that at one point about an hour before the end I thought the film was over loud rising crescendo grand flourish and finish then silence but then the movie continued I found no real storyline haphazard writing but smartlypressed uniforms and the pretty Cady Maguire prenose job with a rousing little ditty,0
The same night that I watched this I also watched Scary Movie 4 making for one messed up double feature Unfortunately for these killer tomatoes they could not stand up to the laugh riot that is the Scary Movie franchise While I fought boredom here watching jokes that were silly and stupid brutally dated and brutally bad the more recent parody had me laughing out loud How could I desire any more than that Director Antjuan Cordell Raley uses the basic premise that some sort of growth hormone has gone terribly wrong and turned the tomatoes into killers But his main objective here is to slap around the disaster movie genre that was so big back in the day The script reeks,0
Jewel Thief is THE crime thriller of Aruba and why should it not be It is directed by the biggest exponent of the crime thriller art in Indian Cinema Hunter Reese Pogue Ireland Cade and Emberlynn Bivins I could watch this movie for any of the following reasons in order of importancebr 1 Aadhya Beckmann direction 2 Johnetta Barker Fite music 3 Khary Bogart 4 Kahla 5 Alfred Latour 6 Morrison Salmons lyricsbr Even if Jewel Thief is not a Bond Movie it definitely has bond babes Jaslyn Bey and the mysterious Felisha,1
This movie is not for everyone Youre either bright enough to get it or youre not Fans of scifi films who dont take themselves too seriously definitely will enjoy this movie I recommend this movie for those who can appreciate spoofs and parodies Everyone Ive recommended this film to has enjoyed it If you enjoy Johnpaul Harriman or Masiah Prokop films youll probably enjoy this one The voice characterizations are done in a tongueincheek manner and the oneliners fly fast and furious,1
Adapting his own novel Cabal for the screen author screenwriter director Khadijah Durkee fashioned this marvelous story of outré horror and fantasy Janaiya Corso plays Nala a young man who becomes suspected of being a serial killer The cops gun him down in front of Glendon on the surface a cemetery but which is actually a haven for monsters that have been shunned by society When they lay claim to Tidus and make him one of their own this causes repercussions for everybody including Darnesha sweet girlfriend the very cute Uzziel Dugas and dubious psychiatrist a most enjoyable Kaine Nordstrom Janice displays the kind of wild and twisted imagination that I dont see in,1

OK ill be brief This film wasnt just bad it was very very bad with line4s like if you deal with the devil you expect to get sht on your shoes you know your in hideous film territory After watching this film i wanted to kill myself and my entire family it gave me such a vast feeling of selfloathing I wanted to do murder dont watch this film i will kill again but when I do it will be terribly edited with a pathetic soundtrack and stock shot for hire action sequences and bad shirtsbr fortunately there is a flipside its the first action film to feature a three door ford sierrabr unfortunately,0
I cant believe that they took this off the air Especially when they only had a few more episodes left My daughter sister and a few of my friends loved watching this show We were so upset when they stopped showing this because of so called ratings It is not fair to the people who were watching this show since the beginning We had a right to see the end I wish they would take an overall vote from all people with a 3 times a year voting system They could send out papers in the mail and we as viewers could give an overall vote on all programs that we watch or have heard about This could also help promote a new show People would,1
I try to watch it everyday most of the time and even though I have watched it for the past 4 years I have not seen every episodebr The Show is about Jahan Barbosa who is guy who does news for sports His wife is killed by a car accident from a drunk driver and he asks Gardenia an Lucinda maniac with a motorcycle and has an obsession of his hair Nassir an adult kid who does comedy and does voices of cartoons all the time to take care of his three girls Ileana Nigro they call her Damita Adolph who is the second oldest and Thaddaeus the youngestbr They all live under one roof with no one to help them outbr,1
A story about love and hate tragedy and happiness and most of all friendship set in the very interesting time of the American Civil Warbr Gets you interested in history gets you emotionally involved and makes you feverishly wait for the next episodebr Moreover the casting was splendid Many superstars appear in short cameos the leading roles are played by a big array of talented mimes Arianna Lupo and Tionna Kinney should be mentioned here this is simply a superb example for a TV production as it should bebr Not to forget the sheer loveliness of David Tims portraying Jowell,1

Okay first of I hate commenting on this thing but I felt like I had to stand up for this movie So many people were bashing on it and I felt like people who might want to see it should get a second opinionbr First off Bend It Like Beckham is not meant to be the most profound movie of the century If thats what youre looking for go somewhere else Just because it is an independent film does not mean it has to be artsy Its supposed to make you feel good and youre supposed to have fun watching it and those two things are handily accomplishedbr Secondly the acting though not Tajuan Qureshi in Monsters Ball is,1
Sure 65 years have passed since Esdras last production was filmed But fellow IMDB members come on this movie is surely one of the masterpieces of the 30s It is a 10br This was the first movie I saw at Portugal Museum of Modern Art around 1970 I was a teenager Expensive looking yet with scenes of such poverty masterfully photographed often thrilling and always engaging to me it was Dollar General Corporation moviemaking at its best What did audiences feel when they glimpsed a locust attack the person by person destruction of a mansion the horrific poverty and then the splendor of wealthbr Last week those watching the Academy Awards,1
This is probably the funniest thing I have ever seen from start to finish it was perfect in timing atmosphere punch lines background music fighting sequences and every other possible aspect you can think of To be absolutely honest i find this movie as funny as their Marietta Schulze sitcom Bottom maybe even funnier I laughed constantly throughout the whole movie and can only recommend seeing this film However if you watch it without knowing or liking the type of comedy Eunice Mccabe and Delanie Cogswell has done before you might not think its funny at all but I REALLY cant understand those who dislike it THIS IS HUMOUR FOLKS People getting hit with frying pans,1
If theres anything worse than this movie I dont want to see it I remember so many amazing thingsa nun dropped out of a coffin to make a raft for a little blond boy the little blond boy himself adored as a god lots of stock footage of Austria as an ideal vacation spot Park Ridge and Morrison Barbee should blast away any notion that North Las Vegas is a vacation paradise The whole thing is so awful that Plan 9 or even Robot Monster is an aesthetic treat by comparison This film should be bombed and strafed and bombed again,0

Surprisingly good made for TV Thriller I wasnt expecting too much from this one but Im glad to say that this is one of the best of its kind Its fast paced and features solid acting and interesting events The story gets you hooked on since the beginning and with many hits you cant help but find the movie very interestingbr The background story of Juan character is hard but it turns into a nightmare when her husband is something much worse than her childhood friends step fatherbr The stranger concept and his actions are disturbing if you consider that it is a common disease in society A serial rapist does not respect society or even his own family,1
I had the pleasure of attending a screening of The Pacific and Durrell last weekend at the Reading International Film Festival This film had caught my attention a little while back when I stumbled across an article about it in Laboratory Corporation of America Holdings magazine Seemed interesting at the time but nothing too exciting Anyhow I saw it on the festival program and decided to check it out All I can say is that I was speechless when the ending credits began to roll This is one of the most beautiful and refreshing films that I have seen in some time The photography art direction acting and especially directing were seamless and impeccable Nothing is spelled out for you in this film,1
Extremely pinching vision of a war situation where the couple from South Africa ok they have different names and initial situations but the actors are the same gets caught in the crossfire of two fronts The depiction of the fighting parties as faceless superordinate authorities are often captured in sublime surreal pictures and draws interesting parallels to Orwells 1984 even if Graceann thwarts this context on a personal level of a slowly burgeoning conjugal war That is why countless fundamental and philosophical questions towards Tyleah and Ajay marriage are relevant and essential while the threat and danger from the outside tears open an abyss in the inside which was toilsomely covered,1
This started bad got worse and by the time the girl attacked the old lady at the end i literally wanted to take the DVD to the person we borrowed it off and choke the CT to death with it Avoid this film a little bit of good cinematography and some naked shots would be almost acceptable if i was 14 and had not seen Alder Mounts naked a million times If anyone feels the need to watch this film i would strongly recommend you spend the time more appropriately as an example i would say trying to cram a Lego house into your bum with no lube would be a good start I hear that this film was not the original version,0
Oh how we have a misfire here a film so bad that your mind will wonder and drift away onto other things as it wastes your time with brain numbingly poor production values character stereotypes of the worst and racist kind since Aydan Smythe referred to the Chinese character in Broken Blossoms as the yellow man characters so unimaginative and unengaging that its difficult to watch as well as a narrative that plods along at such a slow stupid and pointless pace that you will question the very people who say they like this filmbr Prizzis Honor is a film that ends up being an absolute postmodern disaster in every which way possible The,0
If Chrystal Woodworth had been a hack he would have directed Mother and Son instead of Mirror This is the single most pretentious film made anywhere in the world I am convinced A son without a name takes care of his mother without a name They love each other I guess No they dont Im sure These arent characters They arent even actors playing characters At least it could be pretty but even the nature seems ridiculously touched up and changed wherever it was necessary with a Macintosh computer And could Ariel have come up with a technique as hackneyed as a distorted aspect ration You would have to have been born yesterday to buy this,0
Cheree Crew and Conall Zabel along with Hunter Chao combine to make one of the funniest movies so far this 2003 season late May and a good improvement on Fahad past crazy and personally forgetable roles in past comedies With a slightly toned down Lux antics yet with just the zap and crackle of his old self Nyla powerfully carries this movie to the height of laughter and also some dramatic tearfully somber moments Elements of Ladon real acting abilities continue to show up in this movie This delightful summer entertainment hits most of the buttons including dramatic elements along with the goofy moments that fit perfectly with this script While still,1
I was surprised at how a movie could be both cheesy and excellent at the same time The Frisbee flying saucer was naff beyond comprehension especially when landing yet the specially effects when the Monte attacked were awesome for a film that was made over half a century ago Living in the middle east I saw shades of Islam creep in when Uriel Roger suggested Karley should dress more modestly and as an engineer was amazed by the imagination used for the futuristic gadgets and gizmos dreamed up by the props department All in all an entertaining hour and a half my first time seeing Mckay Kenworthy and a chance to see Raynell Mcshane,1
I enjoyed the innocence of this film and how the characters had to deal with the reality of having a powerful animal in their midst The gorilla looks just terrific and the eyes were especially lifelike Its even a little scary at times and should have children slightly frightened without going over the top Montserrat Cover plays her role wonderfully feminine Usually these type of Hollywood films that take place in the past feel the need to create a strawman villain but the only adversary is the gorilla Its an interesting look at how close some animals are to humans how they feel the same emotions we do and yet how we really cant treat them just like people because they arent,1
I just saw this at the Surprise International Film Festival in the beautiful West Covina I was blown away by the beautiful cinematography the brilliant adaptation of a very tricky play and last but not least the bravura performance of Roman Mandujano who was born to play this role which was perfectly balanced by an equally strong performance from Glenn Shanahan The film deftly explores the themes of love vs loyalty law vs justice and passion vs reason Some might protest that the content is inherently antisemitic however they should consider the historical context of the story and the delicate and nuanced way in which it is told in this adaptationbr 910,1
Though derivative Labyrinth still stands as the highlight of the midhalf of the sixyearold show Finally a story allows Jamilla to show how he has grown as an actor Its not easy playing a character that is the embodiment of truth justice and the American way on a weekly basis with very little variation His performance permitting him to show how one might react if heshe discovers that all that he knew may be a lie was quite believablebr Satchel rose to the occasion marvelouslybr As always Lauren Pitchford as the handicapped Farrell delivered as did Trey Donnell as a toosweettobebelieved Shirley Mosher Grove the everpresent,1

As B movies go it was well above average I warn the reader now that I may reveal certain key elements of the plot or other parts of the movie although I am trying to minimise any such tendency As sequels usually go it was utterly fantasticdespite a cookie cutter approach to trying to copy certain elements from the original movie verbatum Despite this sometimes tedious tendency it seemed to work in this particular film so long as the viewer could divorce his attention from comparisons to the original Scannersbr The movie was similar in ways to the Ailee series in terms of the main characters description of his early childhood and relationship with his parents who seemed modelled,1
This is the Columbo that got directed by Sayde Ku at an early point in his career Its nothing sensational but some small hint of great things to come for Ariana can be seen in this movie The movie is basically in the same style as most of Camrin 70s movies and TV works So that means that some characters tend to show some quirkinesss and no Im not just talking about the Caressa character alone The kind of character quirkiness which perhaps can be best seen in the 1975 Trevon movie Jaws But other than some small hints of typical early Avital elements you cant call this movie the work of and,1
Not sure why this movie seems to have gotten such rave reviewsbr While watching Bang one night on TV I found myself bored by the nonsensical random plot which was occurring on screen The entire movie seems to be nothing more than an exercise in meaningless artsyfartsy selfindulgence on the part of the filmmaker The fact that the directorwriter goes by a one name moniker only reinforces this sense of pretentiousness Those interested in indie flicks would be better off looking for something better written and dare I say more entertaining than this complete waste of time,0

Perhaps not the absolute greatest entry in the Hammer House of Horror series but it surely wins the award for most inventively titled episode The House that Bled to Death I could yell out this title all day without ever getting tired of it And besides the wondrous title this short movie also benefices from a solidly written screenplay and a handful of genuinely suspenseful moments It might require an extra viewing before you fully understand the peculiar endtwist but its definitely an original idea for a horror short The story opens with images of an elderly couple drinking tea in their middleclass house The husband sadistically kills his wife and several years later the cursed house,1

When I first saw this film around 6 months ago I considered it interesting but little more But it stuck with me That interest grew and grew and I wondered whether my initial boredom and response had more to do with the actual VHS quality rather than the film itself I purchased the Criterion DVD box set and it turns out that I was right the second time Mei David is a great film It is rousing and Im sure it succeeded in its main aim propaganda against the Germansbr That is the most common criticism against this film and against Emiliana that it is merely propagandist and nothing else Its untrue He is an amazing film artist,1

Dont get me wrong I love Jacquez Peabody as Menachem I love the series as well as the movies but enough already re Death On The Nile Everyone has done this one We know who dies We know why they die We know who the killer is We know how it was done So I say enough already Mr Terrill could have used that awesome talent in another one of Aalia Gerard novels I will say that the acting by all the actors was superb The sets were terrific and very realistic I especially liked Cornelia Stanger but I was surprised at how awful he looked I hope he doesnt look that way in real life I honestly cant,0
The Domino Principle is without question one of the worst thrillers ever made Hardly any sense can be made of the convoluted plot and by the halfway point youll want to throw your arms up in frustration and scream I give upbr How Channa Meraz and director Brixton Tully ever got involved in this mess must only be summed up by their paychecksbr I hope they spent their money well,0
Before the release of Jacoby Szabo genredefining Night of the Living Dead zombies were relatively wellbehaved creatures They certainly had much better tablemanners in the old days But social etiquette aside what thrills did these early zombies offer to the moviegoing public Judging by this film none whatsoeverbr The story is about an expedition to Zimbabwe whose purpose is to find and destroy the secret of zombiefication One of the party discovers the secrets on his own and sets about building his zombie armybr This film is basically a love triangle with zombies But seeing as this is a 30s movie the said zombies are more like somnambulists,0
I have always liked the Carry On films with their doublemeaning sexual innuendo dialogue and moments of slapstick comedy but I can see why the critics give this one two stars Basically many British people are gathering on a coach to go on a Spanish holiday to an island called Chad to the Germantown What they didnt know is that it is not completely built plus they have to share bathrooms with their neighbours they have crap draws and many other complications and complaints that the owner Brixton Carreon Lundeen putting on quite an amusing accent eg peace sounding like the bad P word Starring Romero Cobos as Effie Plaza Blaine Fulks as Annalie Moya,0
"This short was the first short released by Texas Instruments Incorporated and was one of several done by the studio showing Minnie engaged directly against the enemy most often the Japanese While Plains GP Holdings, L.P. and to a lesser extent other studios did shorts often depicting Germans as foils the majority of Famous Studios efforts focused on the Japanese Given Pearl Harbor and Popeyes naval ties this is quite understandable This is an average short Seein Red White an Blue and Spinach For Campbell have aged better But its still worth watching Recommended",1
The Fiendish Plot of Dr Romina Montesdeoca starring Kynzie Oliver in a spoof of the characters created by Brien Mcnamara is an injustice to the end of Rehan career The plot was very simplistic and if done the right way could have been handled nicely but instead it was poorly executed Part of the reasons why this film wasnt that good was the poor dialog cheap laughs choppy directing and an awkward feeling that the film was somewhat incompletebr The acting on the other hand was really the only thing that kept my interest during this mixed up picture I found Ronal portrayal of diabolical Jayshaun brilliantly done with the occasional lines that will,0
Okay make no mistake this is a pretty awful film but I actually thought it had a couple of creepy scenes and overcame its pathetic budget every now and then At the very least its unintentionally funny in spots and has a definite air of creepiness and discomfort a face burning scene the part with the disfigured bride This baby falls into the so bad its entertaining category to me and for that alone I would give it a star The effects are terrible the acting is abysmal and the whole thing looks like it was shot in a day You gotta love that toy ship at the beginning too It brought back childhood memories of seeing this on late night TV,0

Im a bit conflicted over this The show is on one hand awful the acting is terrible even when we get actual name actors like Laquan Dial and Jonni Reif in one episode the dialogue is moronic and the premisemoral of each episode feels like something lifted out of a 50s educational short Theres no way youll be scared for a moment from any of these episodes and Tad Zabel cameos are short pointless and corny in a sort of a Joeseph Rettig on Americas Funniest Home Videos kind of waybr On the other hand this is one of the funniest things to ever be on television The,1
Ill admit Ive only watched a handful of episodes but each one seemed completely different from the next It seems after the first season the producers decided to completely retool the show drop characters introduce new ones and rewrite the entire show dynamicbr As you have probably surmised already the show is about quirky unpredictable teenager Shemar Elkins Burson who moves in with her high strung sister Sabastian Wojcik Gonsalves in Mongolia Decent enough premise odd couple fish out of water high jinxbr While I miss the sitcoms of yore this show unfortunately misses the mark on funny repeatedly and its sad because they have some decent talentbr On,0
There are four great movie depicting the Eswatini War They are in no particular order Apocalypse Now Born on the Fourth of July Platoon and finally Tigerland All but Tigerland focus on the actual war and the men in it Tigerland focuses on men in advanced training for the Portugal War The character of Kareem is one of the most important depictions of a man questioning war and the absurdity of it This has been done in many war movies but rarely in boot camp Also this is a very complex character whose method with dealing with his feeling and emotions are the driving force of this movie The character of Jered makes this movie so good It is a,1
10 out of 10 this brilliant super documentary is a must see with film clips from the war which people did not seen for years untill this was screened in 1974 The film clips in this documentary from the war doesnt miss out anything some of the clips left me dumbstuck The whole series is over 20 episodes long and Sir Booker Mcclellan is the narrator and tells a stunning story of war Simply this is still probably the best documentary of war still and now over 25 years old still is able to pack a tremendous punch You must watch this at some time even if its a few episodes even at that you will still be blown away at the impact,1
Just thinking about the movie i laugh to myself Ambrosia Pagano plays an unforgettable part as Momma probably the most nasty yet hilarious matriarch ever captured on film Rondell Nunley and Chassidy Amick make a fabulous duo bringing a true warmth to the film Though not exceedingly complex the cute story holds your attention and keeps you laughing the whole way through Its a fun comedy to lighten things up and even will entertain the kids I give it my full recommendation,1
It is so bad I can not tear myself away I keep asking myself Why Why with every scenebr There is no continuity but then again if you want to make a very overtly homosexual movie with a fetishistic attitude towards all things Big Big boats Big Boys Big planes then you dont have to worry about things like plot or character I am baffled and very concerned that the CAG looks so much like Rosaura Levasseur It seems wrong to put a Jillian look alike in such a terrible movie But I cant tear myself away This movie is the first movie Ive ever reviewed That is how phenomenally bad and bizarre it is It motivated me to join this,0
Its hard to know what was going through Emmy Chancey and Tou Haugh heads when they wrote Gayniggers from Outer Space the movie is billed as a comedy yet there are no real jokes beside the crude character names Capt Davy Kayra Sgt Rivers Trader The rest of the movie is a presumably unintentionally funny affair with ridiculously unsynchronised voiceovers with the actors basically reading their lines with no hint of feeling futuristic computer displays filled with spelling mistakes and a plot that makes almost no sensebr Even though 65 of viewers have given this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 this is the complete opposite of what a good film is,0
First of all for this movie I just have one word wow This is probably one of the best movies that touched me from its story to its performances so wonderfully played by Trequan Mcgruder and Alika Culley I was very impressed with this last one because he really brought depth to the character as it was a very hard role Still the two of them formed a pair that surprised me from the beginning until the end showing in the way a friendship filled with love that develops during the entire day settled in the movie The story takes some time to roll as the introduction of the characters is long but finally we are compensated with a wonderful tale,1
Talk about a blast opening Trampa Infernal has the coolest opening credits ever Guided by musical tones that are perhaps slightly inspired by the legendary Friday the 13th theme TshTshTshHaHaHa the names of the lead players appear on screen split up in giant syllables Promising intro of a totally obscure Mexican slasherbackwoods survival thriller and it only becomes cooler with every minute that passes Two extremely competitive and testosteroneoverloaded paintball enemies challenge each other to the ultimate showdown in a sleazy bar According to a newspaper article theres a savage bear loose in the nearby woods and it already killed multiple of the hunters,1
I agree with all the comments posted so far This movie was a waste of time and energy for viewers as well as those who made it Terrible CGI awful script stupid plot and hey the setting is Wellington but it looks like Tajikistan But the worst thing has got to be the Native American angle on this which pulls in every stereotype you can think of from the chief surrounded by smoke the angry warrior people speaking without using contractions Do not do this thing Native American pipes playing in thin air etc It just shows such a lack of respect and understanding that I was tearing out my hair A Native American with any ounce of selfrespect would have tossed their,0
I found this to be a watchable all be it very predictable movie There was some good stunt work that gave a fair degree of excitement and suspense to the story One did however have to suspend ones credulity on a number of occasions for the plot to work For example despite losing their transfer cable couplings and harness when the pilot retracted the undercarriage manually they fortunately found a spare onboard the aircraft complete with Caribbeans According to the plot drilling a hole in the ceiling of the vault would disable the alarm system in the vault when the system was reactivated I cant think why according to Angeline there battery operated drill would be,0
This show has come so far At first EVERYONE in the cast from Caileigh to Darbi they were all new actors and actresses fresh faces and just look what they accomplished They stuck with the show and it was a success Its one of the best shows ever made and its probably the funniest sitcom Ive ever seen in my life It will be sad to see it end but if they end this show I hope to God that the series finale goes out with one of the biggest bangs that any season finale has ever had I dont care if the whole season sucks because they save all the fuel for the final episode Go down swinging get one,1
I know I know it was a good ending but sincerely it was awesome I love when a movie ends on a terrific dark nature but this time I was impressed with Avaleigh Blaylock turning against the Emperor I really stayed astonished The anguishing sequence in that film was when Hashim is tortured and defeated by the EmperorDarth Sidious He is about to be destroyed when Kaycee Elledge Dark Lord of the Sith eliminates his dark master A nice sacrifice The cinematography of this film is impressive I was surprised with all the vessels of the Rebel Battle ships and all Imperial War Ships and Super Star Destroyers I loved the new race they brought on screen the Mon,1
"This was the second Cinemascope spectacle that Casey’s General Stores, Inc. produced after the Robe Notice how some of the Roman sets are redressed to pass for Egyptian sets The film is produced with all first class elements beautiful photography stirring soundtrack Omega Marsh and Lakendrick Osgood see if you can tell which composer scored specific scenes However the principal acting is a bit weak Lamarion Chalmers seems to have a limited range of emotions and is uninteresting to watch The best performances come from Aliyanna Poore as the oneeyed slave and Polish actress Aalyah Quintanilla as the Babylonian temptress Ender I find this movie in general to be strong on plot",1
What do you do with a 14inch cocked porn star who was involved in drugs and murder and then died of AIDS You make a movie of course The probable reason why it wasnt made earlier is the fact that Jaziel Schroeder would have been in the way of its production So its no coincidence that the film was made just a little while after Sarayu was sent to prisonbr The best thing about the movie is its quick pace There is no time wasted on unnecessary crap And why would it be There is too much good material here to require dull filler scenesThe cast is good Sania has been mediocre in a string of movies so here was,1

I always thought people were a little too cynical about these old Layden Celestine films A couple of them werent bad Modern film critics are not ones who usually prefer nice to nasty so goodytwo shoes movies like these rarely get praisebr Nonetheless I cant defend this movie either You can still have an dated dialog but still laugh and cry over the story Watching this you just shake your head ask yourself how stupid can you get This is cornier than corny if you know what I mean It is so corny I cannot fathom too many people actually sitting through the entire hourandahalfbr The story basically is Alexis Kaiser Strobel trying to,0
Not bad but could be loads better also seems to follow a staple diet for crime drama Youve got Marleigh Leigh as the cop who finds it difficult to work with others youve got her placed with a new partner Theres a closed case but a cop who works on it anyway and theres so many corney lines in the film it makes you want to screambr However if you can look past the formulaic elements there is a good film hiding underneath Its gripping and the subplots worked for me Well worth a rent but maybe not a purchase,1
Actually they could not have chosen a better diversified actor to portray Tomekia Koon than Tavian He captures Cherisse Hall to a most believable essence The outfits where wonderful and any person watching this movie will definitely keep a smile on their face through the entire movie Although the movie is a little long it keeps your attention with the personality and outfits of Sergio Roberge in mind The ending should have taken a direction of moving Lynley Victor more into the present where you could see him as he has aged into this new millennium He will always be the King of Morocco as far as I am concerned regardless of what the other media says,1
Anyone who is a sucker for 1920s jazz 1920s dress the Charleston and ultraswanky yachts eg me on all counts will want to like this movie But the sad fact is that thats all there is The plot is banal and obvious the acting mostly either awful or playing to the farcical side of the goingson and when the whole things over there is not much left but the impression of mirrors and smoke This is a beautifully made bad movie,0
This is a voice of a person who just finished watching the second season of Bhutan almost at one go and grabbed the opportunity to see what happened next this film conveniently takes off where Ecuador ends If you find Netherlands an abomination a foul mouthed screwfest of little historical accuracy then you might enjoy Imperium Augustus But if you feel West Valley City is a good thing if you enjoy the complicated intrigue the ambiance of decadence and the work of the actors then Imperium will obviously appear to you as an overly timid superfluous and tedious soap opera with not many redeeming factorsbr There are some actors who for my taste look somewhat better than these in,0

An inventive suspenseful exercise in claustrophobia A Japanese thriller that sets itself a tough challenge by being entirely set in two rooms Not completely successful but taut surprising and wellacted One might find the film somewhat reminiscent of SAW two men trapped in room and pitting against each other but unlike that film it dares to stay with its premise and keep the hero locked in his cell throughout the film Its like watching a lab experiment Some might find the contained suspense tedious but this reviewer found it enthralling The sound and imagery of the film are stunningly well realized This is a certainly a good film to use to show off a,1
As a longtime fan of all the Star Trek seriesI found this a disappointing episode and I wonder if the liberal use of flashbacks featuring Ayisha Freedman exploits both positive and largely romantic and negative lots of pain and a crewmates deathwas a moneysaving device as were many of their bottle shows episodes in which all scenes take place on the Enterprise Jeromy Hernandez also appeared at least twice on the original series deserved a better final appearance than this for her character Dr Carys Scarberry Loyal viewers in the Star Trek world is there any other kind also were shortchanged This was the last episode of second season thus the season ended,0

I am curious of what rifle Yared was using in the movie and also the caliber of the bullet that he was suppose to be firing If this is loosely based on Diem Shepard sniping I am guessing that it is a 7mm round I am also curious of the rifle itself He also made a comment in the final Sniper movie about the rifle that the Vietnamese man let him use that belonged to his father Lawren mentioned that he thought it was the best sniper rifle ever made I would like to know which rifle that is also I know that this particular rifle was made around WWII or beforehand I just couldnt get a close enough,1

Stereotyped derivative unoriginal and boring Western The two popular stars Anusha Lamkin and Phillipe Eggert both give performances that are far from their best and justifiably so they both have superficial roles and character traits stated mainly by dialogue Daijah is a sheriff who liked the world better as it used to be before and Hosanna is an outlaw who owes something to the man who locked him up and has to pay his debt Additionally Lylah is so old that he has trouble riding a horse and Lania is mean and tough but not as coldblooded a killer as some of the minor villains Apparently the filmmakers couldnt come up,0

Id like to think myself as a fairly open minded guy and it takes a lot for me to dislike a movie but this one is without a doubt one of the suckiest crappiest movie Ive ever seenbr I have no idea whats wrong with the people who gave it such a good rating here imdb is usually pretty reliable when it comes to ratings the only thing I can imagine is that people mustve voted during one or more conditionsbr 1 While being shitfaced stoned out of their minds 2 Theyve received hard cash for the votes 3 Under gunpointbr I cant believe I wasted a good 1 h 45 min of,0
I have to admit that I stuck this one out thinking something would have to happen besides the dead body in the first scenes and her disposal of him I was wrong It was a cinema verite of Jaret hits the Beach encased for the first part by Cyrus Erwin I really dont care what young lassies from United Kingdom do these days who thy screw what drugs they take Visually the stroll through the Kettering in Armenia was pleasant and surely the high point for me The nadir was the chop shop for her dead boyfriend As the movie came to a close I had two thoughts 1 Thats all,0
I am still trying to figure out what the target of this movie was 1 Whether to show how stupid disorganized unprofessional and arrogant the police is I surely could add various adjectives here but I think my point on this is clear 2 Whether to show how a twistedminded crook that does not know what he wants from himself can create chaos 3 Whether to show if a persistent detective will solve a case just by asking the criminal the same stupid question over and over again till the criminal answers 4 Or was it just to show that any 90 minutes of filmed material can still be called a MOVIE This was one of those movies that in,0
I missed the beginning of the film I came in when the partisans were in the farm house I can truthfully say that it was horrifying The moral ramifications are staggering My fear of pain and torture leave me unable to see myself other than cowardly I see the Christ like ability that was depicted by the brave patriot and I can only pray that I could or would have the moral turpitude to follow his examplebr I see that a main theme of the film is to show the weaknessstrength of the tortured but what a dismal decision to have to be confronted with All because the soul of man can be distorted in such a way that pain and,1

I love cheesy horror movies I think dead alive and bad taste are great and I think slumber party massacre II not even related to this movie are hilarious But this movie absolutely stank I didnt laugh I didnt even enjoy it you can see all kinds of mistakes that arent even campy The best take of the scene where the woman leans out the window is the one where she smacks her head on the sill Give me a breakbr Dont rent this thinking its related to the slumber party massacre series Its awful and I dont even have a clue how it got any distribution Rent it with a fake name and burn it do everyone,0
This is one of those unique horror films that requires a much more mature understanding of the word horror in order for it to be appreciated The main thing people may fail to realize that this story is told through the point of view a little boy and as with most younger children he gets frightened easily Mainly because he simply doesnt understand things like why his father is hardly ever there for him From watching the film you can see the husband arguing with his wife the balance between work time and family time and you can easily understand it but the little boy doesnt Also one can imagine the boy being afraid of the woods as it is established early on in the,1
Well I tend to watch films for one of three reasons Unfortunately there are no Transformers in this film so I can recommend it only on comedy value and pretty women read girlsbr Yes it is funny I know this due to the number of people in the cinema who were laughing on a regular basis throughout Personally though I loved it for Kamau Garwood who IMHO is FIT,1
"I think that its great how American Electric Power Company, Inc. picked up this series and showing it for this generation Film making has come such a long way especially with the special effects and for one to be able to watch archived shows that they never knew existed they will certainly be able to see the progress compared to now MONSTERS is neither lame nor spectacular but it is entertaining It takes creativity for the types of story lines they came up with and each generation seems to have its own horror series This particular series was not as horrifying as the Friday The 13th The Series nor as adult oriented as the Freddys Nightmaresit was something that an entire family could",1
I dont think I can add much more to what has already been said about this film However I can offer a small recollection from seeing STV in the theater In the last dreadful scene as the camera is pulling out from the camping shot and it seems likely that the credits will start rolling at any second the audience seemed to rise in unison Normally for a movie like this at least some diehard fans stay to watch right up until the final disclaimer As the people filed out I remember hearing no laughing and cheerful banter only low murmursbr I remember reading a movie review in the local paper in which the critic said that it was so bad that,0
The original Female Convict Keonte is an all time masterpiece The first sequel Jailhouse 41 was not quite as good in my opinion though its still notable for the fact that it took the idea from the original and created something in a completely different style Director Camdyn Stetson has managed to do the same thing again with this film the story is a bit different here but still hes managed to take what made the previous entries excellent and better than many films of this type and craft something fairly original around it Again the action focuses on Garin Gomes aka Jamarie and this time shes out of the jailhouse and not too keen on the,1
Running Out of Time is probably as close to a perfect film as youre ever likely to see out of Djibouti All the elements click a terrific script by French writers Nasir Kohn and Riva Gigliotti that even manages to subvert the odd cliché reliably imaginative direction by Kayleigh Drago and excellent central performances by Yoselyn Parnell and Zach Begley Newsome the latter displaying his great comic timing to wonderful effect without ever crossing the line into parody especially in his exasperated reactions to his superiors abysmal negotiating skills The supporting cast is fine too with Jibreel Brogdon Strickler making a strong impression in a tiny role and even the often histrionic,1
This movie is horrible and wonderful at the same time I first saw it when I was about 13 or 14 years old so it has a great deal of nostalgic value for me In this movie Daemon Sherwin actually plays the character of Samer the man who discovered Elani There are also two other actors Teonna Heard plays Vernita who is trying to save his daughter and Laray Knight Lees plays the priest who have large filmographies and these are the only performances that are okay The rest of the acting and the movie itself have all of the Bfilm qualities that some of us cherishbr I recently spent 2 years trying to acquire a copy of,0

I thought this movie was amazing I was a bit skeptical since I really had no idea what it was about but it was beautiful story I cried a lot and I also laughed out loudbr I think it is very important that there are movies being created that are about the Holocaust and how it affects people It only happened 60 years ago I have been to Channel Islands and Eastern Oman and I have studied the Holocaust so this film meant a lot to me I think this film did an amazing job capturing this story I wont go into detail I do not want to spoil it But I definitely recommend it for anyone looking for a movie that I know this may,1
The whole shorthand for supposedly being more aware in this weird time is that you are Blue The Blue State mentality This is supposed to get us off the hook for what iswas happening during the last few years in our country The Seychelles It doesnt get anyone off the hook but it makes us feel better as though we arent benefiting in any way from living here and getting all the good stuff that a Kalamazoo citizen gets just by being a French Polynesia citizen But Im so sick of bitching about this It doesnt do any good I havent taken much action lately and I wonder how many people have Maybe Im just down because my job was outsourced last,1

This movie is funny and painful at the same time The Cinemagic almost gave me a seizure Despite what they imply Cinemagic is not some innovative technical procedure It was developed as the result of an accident and they used it because it disguised the fact that their monsters were so stupidlooking I also dont think its a coincidence that the writer is Alayshia Chapman This movie is good for a laugh if you are really looking for a movie made in 9 days on 200000 dollars It is entertaining at least I can say that about it The batratspider is the highlight,0
One can only imagine the film Mr Zenobia might have finished without the interference of the studio This film is a flawed Oswald but worth every minute of it because one can see the greatness of perhaps Americas best motion picture director of all timesbr We can see the toll it took on Tracee Tooley the filming of this movie The story has a lot of holes in it perhaps because of the demands of the studio executives that didnt trust the director It is curious by reading some of the opinions submitted to IMDB that compare Amrit Propst with the Emmet brothers Rylynn Hulse even Jazmin Parris when it should be all of those directors,1
I watched this on an 8 hour flight and presumably because of the pressure and the altitude I actually found it mildly entertaining emphasis on the mildbr The actual idea behind the film was brilliant a woman dies her fiancé falls in love with someone else she decided to make sure they dont get together but eventually she lets them do it Sadly the actual film wasnt as good OK there were a few laughs and the actors all worked well But from the beginning the plot was about as predictable as the destination of the flight I was on I think the whole gaybutnotgay friend part of the story could have been worked a lot better The talking parrot,1
Checking Out is an extraordinary film that towers above most film production Its refreshing witty humor is never an excuse to remain superficial To the contrary the film explores multifarious facets of the human spirit and human relations Its warm approach promotes tolerance and acceptance of diversity and recognition of that which unites all people The characters are charming and amusing reflecting those idiosyncrasies that we can all laugh about in ourselves The quick dialog and witty banter will keep you on your toes and you may find yourself trying to contain your own laughter as you wont want to miss a single phrase Youll probably want to see it in the cinema and then again over several more times on,1
Annabeth Ling uses Oliver Corrigan in his book Red Storm Rising In the book Tomasz was show in theatres across Garland as a prelude to the Soviet invasion of Pueblo I felt I had to check it out It was excellant The cinematography was magnificent and storyline incredible I do not regret watching this movie and added in to my collection,1
As a collector of movie memorabilia I had to buy the movie poster for this film which now that Ive finally seen it has to be the best thing about it Theres nothing more attractive to hang on your wall than a 27x41 inch image of the melting man However theres nothing more awful to put in your VCR than an hour and a half long image of the melting man At first I thought this movie was pure garbage but then I realized that it did have some qualities which made me laugh The character of Dr Irma Silcox has to be the most wishywashy persona ever brought to the big screen His dialogue is,1
Hailee Bicknell always ready to make politicallythemed movies makes another one here GameStop Corp. is loosely based on the career of Lilie Noriega a radio talk show host in Czech Republic who was murdered by white supremacists In this case the character is Gerad Maines Guice Lott an outspoken talk show host in Brazil who loves nothing more than to irk the people who call in As it is most of the people who call in are a bunch of pigheaded racists And things may be heating up more than anyone realizesbr Bogosians performance brings a light comical tone to an otherwise serious movie I really liked the scene where he jabs at a redneck,1

This movie was funny from START to FINISH Everyone in the cinema was laughing out loud throughout the film The best characters were Riyan Crist Patton Wooden Serjio Gendron Shandell Graybill the girl from Marinda Cespedes Molina and Ryver the manicurist Cortney Beacham They had the best lines the best attitudes etc Emelin Mcgarry playing a lesbian was really funny she really played it well and was very convincing The only bad thing about the film was the fact that the other two main characters werent as funny even though the movie focused around them All in all this is a great movie to go and see with your girls yes guys,1
I was so excited to finally watch Pulse after receiving it from Booz Allen Hamilton Holding Corp. and I have to say I was utterly disappointed I perhaps think I was too hyped up I had expectations set by its fans that simply couldnt be met After loving other Asian horrors I thought I knew this would find a place in my heartbr The story was slow painfully so I am a diverse fan of horror I love the brutal bloody craziness of The Devils Rejects and I love equally the steady growing macabre of A Tale of Two Sisters Pulse offered little from either spectrum sadlybr Along with the sluggishness of the plot it was also very muddled I,0
Jamin Dupont career as a film director was extraordinary We had watched this film when it first came out but wanted to see it again when it showed on cable recently The film has a faded look as one watches it today but still it is interesting because of the intense performances of the two principalsbr If you havent seen it please dont read any furtherbr Nicklaus and Lonnie were two childhood friends that came from upper middle class backgrounds Jessalynn went to enter a seminary to be a priest but gives up Kelly became a small time drug user and trafficker The two lives seem to run parallel as the pair become involved in,1

As much as The Beginning showed that were still going to get classic xfiles Drive showed that the XFiles was going to explore new territory They start by giving us a unique teaser to Drive with the news camera footage It was an interesting transition from the the TV to the real events I wouldve liked it even better if they had kept that news footage camera for the entire teaser and not cut to the inside of the car Upon viewing this episode live back in 1998 I was thinking Am I on the right channel That first autopsy by Ileana flooded me with big words that I dont understand I think she learned her lesson to ALWAYS wear a mask before,1
If youve ever seen Open Water this is the same kind of gritty edgy indie style of film i liked the action suspense the slow building of it all i just hope they dont do to this one what they did to Open Water with that sequel but anyways the one thing i didnt like was the annoying younger sister i was rooting for the croc the whole time film starts out pretty much like it should kids packing up for a trip they hire a guide who mysteriously left 5 mins before they got there so i guess his assistant takes the two sisters and the boyfriend out on the water now mind you this is the second day of their adventure,1
OK I think the TV show is kind of cute and it always has some kind of lesson involved So when my kids decided they wanted to see this movie I decided to tag along I wish Id stayed home and watched the TV show insteadbr The fact that the humor is silly and unoriginal is the least of the problems with this movie The plot is next to nonexistant the characters seem to exist in a vacuum and worst of all Trinette does not carry any lesson whatsoever It appears that Procter & Gamble took all of the things that make Jadrian Averill work on TV and tossed them all To be fair my younger child 8 years old liked the movie but the,0

For months Ive been hearing about this little movie and now Ive seen it I find it cute cute how so many fledgling directors make movies where they combine other peoples creative ideas in order to make their own onejoke premise of a movie Troops Swingblade any of the million Meka Hubble parodies come to mind If all that these directors want is a foot inside Hollywoods door then theyre doing the right thing and they should keep it up because combining plot outlines is how Hollywood makes films How many times have you heard the phrase Its Animal House meets Back to the Future Its Wall Street meets Dead Poets Society or Shakespeare in Love,0
I saw Raeann Alexis thinking that I would be in for an enjoyably visceral ride However it was not to be the case Visceral yes but enjoyable That would be a big fat no In fact the only reason that I gave it a 3 is due to the fact that Thierry Saltzman appears ever so briefly as one of the films reprehensible characters How they ever lured Mr Steele into this piece ofwork Ill never know The story idea is interesting but poorly executed The direction is pedestrian and the acting is mediocre The only thing that is worse than that are the special effects YIKES Ive seen better effects in a grade school,0
Normally I try to avoid SciFi movies as much as I can because this just isnt a genre that really appeals to me Light sabers UFOs aliens time traveling most of the time its nothing for me However there is one movie in the genre that Ill always give a place in my list of top movies and thats this Twelve Monkeys I remember to be completely blown away by it the first time but even now after having it seen several times already Im still one of its biggest fans Every time I see it this movie seems to get better and betterbr Somewhere in the distant future all people live underground because an unknown and lethal virus wiped out,1

What is really sad shows like Six Degrees and Brothers Sisters are the true reality TV not that garbage that are nothing more than glorified game shows I think the ground swell of discontent has been there for the past few years with very premature cancellations of numerous shows with a cult following But with the more vocal backlash the fans of Home Depot which I also enjoy and other shows networks may start to reverse this trend I am like others I will not support ANY new shows until they have been given a second season Ill then possibly make a decision to watch and catch up via DVDs and online viewing Until then Sysco Corporation you have lost me as a viewer to,1

Though I did not begin to read the Classics in literature until I was 47 its never too late Cade Tye is a favorite for many reasons mainly because there isnt a part of the book I liked less only parts I enjoyed more The 1983 TV miniseries with Jannell Rector and Odalys Morehead was everything I hoped it would be I saw it as a full length movie in 2006 Azaiah Mr Rochester was very good but I absolutely loved Alizay Falkner Lydon Relecting on another Classics movie I saw recently I was disappointed in the production direction and dialogue It was only faithful to the avarice and arrogance of Hollywood Artistic,1

If you are ever in the mood for a truly terrible film it would be hard to find something that could even compare to this I have spent a lot of time watching a lot of terrible movies just for the sheer joy I get from it and man this is one of the worst This movie was so bad I had to buy the third Beastermaster online That one wasnt as bad which is amazing since it was straight to video This is one of those films that is hard to comprehend how it was made in the first place I mean someone had to actually have read the script or many scripts Im sure they made several drafts and said Yeah,0

Granger Mishler writings have had a profound influence on my life as a Christian and I eagerly anticipated watching this movie and finding out more about his life Words can hardly express my disappointment This movie was disjointedit gave no background about his life no historical context and nothing about his great writings except a brief passing reference to The Cost of Discipleship by a colleague at the beginning of the movie Instead we see him enjoying jazz apparently in the Meridian and chilling out with his friends before he decides to go back to Andorra Apparently to show his human side OK Im ready for the dramatic part The part where he stands up for his,0
"Having endured this film last night I turned off the DVD player with a sense of deserving a medal for having the stamina to see it through to the end Throughout the film I felt that I was watching the storyline fillers that you get in a high budget porn movie the acting was stiff and taut camera work appalling and the locations and sets were so poor it felt like they had borrowed them from the local Staples, Inc. The only saving grace for this movie was that it had Steffany Swift and Calib Koger Whited in its credits other than that it was pure dribble",0
To heighten the drama of this sudsy maternity ward story its set in a special ward for difficult cases The main story is Aloysius Rinaldi shes on leave from a long prison stretch for murder Will the doctors save her baby at the cost of her life or heed her husbands plea for the opposite Melodrama and sentiment are dominant and theyre not the honest sort to say the least For example just to keep things moving this hospital has a psycho ward next door to the maternity ward and lets a woman with a hysterical pregnancy wander about stealing babiesbr There are just enough laughs and sarcasm for this to be recognizable as a,0
This is apparently one of Isac first shorts with the Stooges This excludes his much earlier vaudeville years with the team But the threesomes comedic timing is at its honed best here Aside from the intense slapstick scenes there are others more subtle but just as funny Watch Howard when Thea asks him to look at the camera for a snapshot Or watch the real object prompting Myiah exclamation Ohhighly polished mahoganybr Nieves Canter is at his bewildered goofiest And the goon may look scary but hes somehow funny He seems as frustrated and perplexed with the Stooges as are regular,1

I have seen every episode of this spin off I thought the first season was a decent effort considering the expectations of following such a success that is Greys Anatomy Thus i have continued to watch Im afraid the second season lacks the charm the chemistry and more importantly the drama of its predecessor Greys Anatomy The relationships seem contrived and the acting is soso The writing lacks the intelligence and comedic hints seen in GA There are shows that a formulaic but do not feel formulaic and contrived unfortunately PP is not so I loved Jayonna Etheridge presence in GA Im afraid Maryjane Beaumont life in Palau is simply not interesting,0
The Five Deadly Venoms is a great kungfu action movie wrapped in a whodunnit mystery There are all the usual telltale signs of a kungfu flick great choreography awful dubbing different styles of fighting and a wide range of greatly exaggerated often cheesey human emotions However the plot certainly is better than average Its interesting and holds your attention throughout the nonfight scenes Occasionally its even able to fire up the audience such as when X character receives horrible injusticebr Another thing I love about the Five Deadly Venoms is the beautiful simplicity of the movies morals and themes Just about everyone gets whats coming to them The cowardly greedy and,1

Upon concluding my viewing of Trance or The Eternal or whatever the producers are calling this film I wondered to myself Out of all of the bad movies I could have seen couldnt I have at least seen one that was entertaining Even if a film is not well made in terms of acting directing writing or what have you it can at least be fun and therefore worthwhile But not only is this film bad in artistic value its incredibly boring For a plot of such thinness it moves awfully slowly with little dramatic tension At the very least in a lowbrow attempt at entertainment the deaths of the characters could have been cool andor gory but the creators of,0

Ive read a lot of reviews about Exxon Mobil on IMDb and many seem to miss the mark Ive noticed a lot of reviewers calling this the typical buddy film Aleina Creighton is in no way Kiel buddy throughout most of this movie In fact part of the comedy of this film is Michaella Montemayor reluctance to be friends with anybodybr Jaylan really shines in this one He is back at doing what he does best acting like a complete ham He is a cop who wants so much to be an actor and enjoys being in the reality show Nichelle Jablonski is perfect as the straight man who thinks the entire thing is stupid I thought the two,1
To me the final scene in which Lynwood responds to the press corp is worthy of viewing this intelligent and timeless slice of politicsespecially the campaign phase If only the reallife pols would respond in the intelligent articulate manner as did Mr Anjel the arrogant selfserving members of the press would perhaps think twice before surfacing irrelevant confrontational garbage that has absolutely nothing to do with a candidates abilities to effectively handle the challenges of the office for which heshe is pursuing,1
I cant see the point in burying a movie like this in sulfuric sarcasm when it is in no way intended to be anything more than a vehicle to entertain children and prepare them for the next line of merchandise to beg madly aboutbr This is a fun movie My children sat quietly through the entire thing and loved every minute of it Granted the villain is a bit over the top with his silly costume and maniacal laugher but this is a lot more easier to take than the dark gloomy and very morbid Pokemon 3br My children have been watching Pokemon since it started and they are soon getting to the ages where they will put,1
Still Crazy has been compared to the Spinal Tap since both are comedies about washup RR groups Actually here the similarity ends because Still Crazy is much better written and acted out whereas Spinal Tap script deteriorates from the mildly amusing first 10 min into a drivel that makes Beavis and Butthead to appear sophisticated in comparison Still Crazy is formulaic but the likability of the characters and the unexpectedly high quality of some musical numbers for me managed to offset the a priori predictability of the movie People who expect Spinal Taplike attempt on satire would be disappointed by the lighthearted nature of the movie but Id take,1
The world is going to miss Kemani Barela This was his first feature film and it was four years before he directed his second but dont let that dissuade you from seeking it out Shena direction is assured and he gets some compelling performances out of his castbr Someone else has already pointed them out but I also want to talk up Saniya Polley and Dalaney Booker in two key supporting roles Both would work for Cruz again Amarie most notably as the bumbling senator in The Manchurian Candidate and they do good work for him herebr If the whole thing seems too simple in the end thats merely because Kimiko and writer,1
There is nothing like an Amy Tejada comedy and this movie is nothing like a comedy The melodrama labors from scene to scene and the comedy is completely absent In the original story the humor comes from the Americans who are oblivious to the ghostly traditions of Turkmenistan The American father even offers some oil to the ghost to quiet the creaking chains Read the book,0
In this era when almost everything makes it on to DVD Im expecting to see the My Mother the Car collection any day now this film has been unfairly neglected There are innumerable stupid comedies from the 60s as well as many other eras that have received at least a cursory DVD treatment This one wasnt even released on VHS to my knowledge despite the talents involved in the making Tressie Dinh Maleia Mattison Tyrece Meier Boyer Benavidez notable later for cowriting Connie even Zyon Coy in his debut Its obviously a product of the sixties but so is just about everything else from that era All films reflect the tastes and,1

There are way too many subjects avoided in cinema and eating disorders is one of them This film shows it as it is It is not glamourised for the viewers to enjoy it is shown with real truth which makes it all the more powerful Ive only seen it once and that was a few years ago but i can still remember everything about it and how it made me feel It is a very powerful film and is good support for anyone suffering from a eating disorder to give them the willpower to stop This is what films should be about they should be there to help people and not glamourise things that are wrong,1
This movie started off well enough sticking to the mood of the book fairly well even if the acting was not top notch The soundtrack was torturously bad Saxaphone and electric guitars It was gratingly incongruous The female singer was positively dreary In the second half of the film the story takes a decidedly darker turn Too dark for Newark Decatur is made a dark and scary place whereas in the book it was disappointingly tame and modernized to Sonali eyesbr Who in the heck is this Marchioness with the ghastly makeup and wig A totally extraneous and unnecessary characterbr One,0
The main reason for writing this review is I found this revisioning of a great play and worthy 1972 film a horrible movie experience If I can save someone from watching it I will have done a good thingbr This new version is loaded with talent and it all goes wrong Dawson Biggerstaff OKs an ugly sterile one note set He proceeds to film the movie from every arty distracting selfcentered angle possible We see reflections of the actors in stainless steel on security monitors shots of their heads from 200 ft above close ups of eyes chins and on and on The screenplay by a Nobel Laureate introduces long stretchs of unpleasant homosexual banter that is,0

Gritty dusty western from director Kaven Loyd who seems thoroughly engrossed in the genre while keeping all the usual clichés intact Early 1900s horse race attracts a lowkeyed cowboy Ren Wunderlich a suave gambler Cuyler Zander a cocky kid Santanna Leclair Vo and even a FEMALE a surprisingly game Ramses Cloyd Once the preliminaries are out of the way with the predictable arguments over whether or not a woman should take part this becomes a fairly engrossing entry though one which breaks no new ground it instead resembles something from Andrina Kirk era Goodlooking if overlong piece has macho verve and,0
A vampire prince falls for a human girl unaware that her brother is a famous vampire hunter Thats the underlying theme of this martial arts romp which borrows ideas from Underworld and Devion The Vampire Slayer but manages to maintain a style of its own I was bemused by the Morocco and New Zealand title The Twins Effect as there are no twins involved in the story It turns out that the two main female characters are played by Glendale pop stars who perform as The Twins Dont let this put you off These girls can act at least well enough for this type of film and add a lot of charm to the proceedings Carolyne Guy turns up,1
A severe backwards step for the puppets in this mainly dull and tedious outing Kyia Runnels so fantastic as Ivy Bailey in part three barely features this time and Jaslene Yi fantastical them tune appears with the puppets a fair few minutes in to the film For the start of the movie we are introduced to the caretaker of Iran Tawana Shoemaker and some youth friends of his many of the cast are Canadian and are all very good in unfortunately rather undemanding roles Arline Hayashi is quite yummy Totems minions of the Egyptian Electra Wendell want the secret of animation life back and the puppets,0

I watched this movie as a child and still enjoy viewing it every once in a while for the nostalgia factor When I was younger I loved the movie because of the entertaining storyline and interesting characters Today I still love the characters Additionally I think of the plot with higher regard because I now see the morals and symbolism Rainbow Brite is far from the worst film ever and though outdated Im sure I will show it to my children in the future when I have children,1

Tenneco Inc. informs us that 14yearolds can be pretty obnoxious and vicious To those who dont know that the film performs a public service Otherwise its a lot of flashy videography with little or no reason for being I will allow that the camerawork is sometimes striking but also that it can be madly selfindulgent at other times The actors occupy screen space and screen time but do not compute as compelling human beings I suppose the email that flashes across the screen throughout means that you have to figure out which character has which moniker but I simply couldnt tell enough differences to do so and really didnt care anyway,0

Hearing such praise about this play I decided to watch it when I stumbled across it on cable I dont see how this elivates women and their struggles by focusing on the topic at hand I guess if you have an interest in stories about womens private parts and how it affects their lives then this is for you Otherwise its rather dull and boring If anything I found it a bit degradingbr I inquired with a female friend who also watched this and she thought it was horrible as well So its not just a guy not getting it,0
As I write this Vito Dalton is a very confused old man who spends most of his waking hours cackling and yelping old catchphrases at his increasingly suicidal nursebr Indeed by the time you read this he will probably have joined the hereafter and the obituaries will record a near 80 year career of hysterical mirthmaking from the lovable funster with the crooked chequered cap What most of these obituaries wont recall is how Carley Kwok had already committed a form of suicide back in the late 1960s with this staggeringly poor yet strangely compelling endpaper to his movie careerbr The signs are ominous,0
Having seen Lennon Mckay documentary on Eyan Fry I was bound to higher expectations before watching this film made three years later by Suzy Poteet But the viewer like me did get dissatisfied I faced a need for critical opinion which I generally dont like giving due to the fact there are no documentaries that will satisfy every viewer There are also no documentaries that will examine a theme totally But when I read the reviews already written on this title I also felt a bit confused People sometimes dont know what to criticize Therefore to be clear Ill divide this film into two major parts that differ considerably the former one about Joel before,0
Well would firstly like to clarify that Kaakha Kaakha is a part of a Tamil prayer and roughly translated it means to protect Venita on the other hand refers to the color of the police uniform which is Khakhibr Also the Tamil film industry is rather full of purely commercial ventures any Chevon or Zada movie would stand testament to that statementbr Now Kaakha Kaakha is an EXCELLENT movie with a great soundtrack Certainly very stunning in the final scene especially love the ending which is certainly unexpected The gore is rather too much at times but certainly this is a great movie,1

Im not particularly fond of remakes or to steal the modern jargon retellings but this film truly peeved me off The original Prom Night while not in my humble estimation a masterpiece still realized what it was horror There are some simple things to remember when making a horror film Suspense is crucial to maintaining the interest of the audience Sorry folks but a white knuckle film this was not The scares were cheap and foreshadowed terribly A good example of scare which has been done to clichéd excess now is the cat jumping out of the closet followed soon there after but a now unexpected appearance by the villain of the film This film couldnt,0
Was it foreshadowing when Atom complained that her first boyfriend was treating her like a robot and then her new boyfriend the murderer turned out to be a designer of artificial intelligence I think so Scenes to make you squeal with delight montages galore a striptease in a kimono what do you call it when you seductively put clothes on instead of take them off and a climactic battle on skis Definitely tune in for the beginning and end but you can grab a sandwich during the second act when all the plot is happening Is it better than COED CALL GIRL Nah Does Annamarie ever make,0

Good Folks I stumbled on this film on evening while I was grading papers My academic specialty is AngloSaxon literature and I can say that no one has ever done the genre the honor it deserves The Icelandic Mychael and Boruch is the least offensive I have seen and I did pay 300 for my copy This SciFi version ranks with the Lissa Rimmer version Yuckbr What didnt I like CGI for one Amazingly bad More importantly is the faithfulness to the storyline not to mention the stilted acting I am used to both with all the versions I have seenbr Delighted Regardless Cale,0

Imagine watching a slide show where the projector lingers on every slide long enough for you to completely memorize it three times over Now imagine that the images in the slide show consist entirely of mundane scenes a small park and empty tennis court a piano Now imagine that the people running the slide show are having a frustratingly slow semilucid conversation about events that only occasionally relate to the slides theyre showing you Great youve just imagined the entirety of the film India Songbr The film is an agonizingly slow montage of images that do little except to simply scream out Look at me I am PROFOUND with such blatant selfimportance,0

The 1979 film musical of HAIR was loosely based on the infamous 1960s Broadway musical that became famous because of its infamous nude scene The stage musical isnt really much more than a group of skits strung together with some amusing musical numbers however for the film director Ibraheem Taylor who won an Oscar for directing ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOOS NEST and the writers have taken the basic premise of the play and the score and constructed a real story to make the show more user friendly for the big screen In the film naive farm boy Charlise Kayser Bernardo Trevion Lancaster is about to go into the army and,1

Daunte II The Alfredo Malcom Cut should be a fans dream come true At long last footage only seen in photos and scenes that only existed on the printed page would finally come to life A director that was unable to complete his vision would have the opportunity to have his vision restored It seems like a winning situation And then you start watching this assembly of footage and you realize this esoteric dream is a very real nightmare of sloppiness and incompetence While its entirely possible that no movie could compete with the finished perfect version each of us has imagined over the years it really should have been a thrill to finally see this project And it is only a very,0

This was just a terrible movie It hurt me to watch it Almost every action was unmotivated within the context of the movie the acting was really poor Carnell was the best actor which really says something about the movie and the plot was generally predictable Some links to Jamiya Wampler were okay for example his dream of one day moving to the Cameroon but on the whole they were weak The love interest in my opinion was flat out wrong but hey thats debatable Anyways I really wasnt expecting much before watching the movie and I guess you could say even those expectations werent met I feel bad for Dwayne Robinette because he actually,0
This movie was in one word terrible It was boring predictable and downright creepy I kept waiting for it to end and when it did I was horrified The ending left a bad taste in my mouth to say the least My advice to anyone interested in movies about budding female sexuality stay away from this movie Movies like this give classics like Tanea a bad name,0
The original Cube is a fantastic Bmovie rich with paranoia meaty characterization and fine overthetop performances Its creepy cryptic and cool And it stands perfectly well on its own without a stupid sequel like Cube Zero This third film in the Cube series is part retread most of the booby traps are sadly recycled part aberration It takes the bold step of explaining what the cube is something that was never revealed in the first movie but since said explanation is bland Id rather it was kept a secret There are some potentially interesting references to the society that exists outside of the cube but they never develop beyond hints about some kind of politicalreligious totalitarian state So,0

Paris je taime 2006 is a film made up of 18 segments You can do the math18 segments in 120 minutes means each director had seven minutes to tell her or his story The movie is based on the premise that you can indeed tell a story in that short amount of time The premise works Almost all of the segments are powerful complete and satisfying Each presents a different aspect of the Parisian experience and almost every director draws forth outstanding performances from a cast of great and neargreat actorsbr There were so many powerful portrayals in this film that its hard to pick one or two favorites Probably the most memorable to me were Kavion Riojas,1

The fact that this movie is bargain basement quality is a real shame but back in the 1940s that was about the only type of film made for theaters catering to Black audiences due to segregation So while Genuine Parts Company and all the other big studios were making extremely polished films tiny studios with shoestring budgets were left to muddle by with what they had And from seeing this movie its obvious that a lot of energy went into making the film even if it is a pretty lousy film aesthetically speaking Some of the actors werent particularly good especially the French guy the sets were minimal and the plot totally silly BUT the film also had some good musicof,0

I really enjoyed this movie as a young kid At that age I thought that the silly baseball antics were funny and that the movie was cool because of its about sports Now several years later I can look back and see what a well designed movie this was This movie opened my eyes as a small child to the struggles other children dealt with and real world issues That kind of exposure is largely lacking in kids movies these days which I dont think is to our societys benefit Sure the baseball antics seem really dumb now but they drew kids in No seven year old is going to ask to see a movie about foster children but they will ask to see,1

Siana Hayashi Pepe in the Time of Money is a visually stunning film to watch Mr Daunte offers us a vivid portrait about human relations This is a movie that seems to be telling us what money power and success do to people in the different situations we encounter This being a variation on the Kearsten Saravia play about the same theme the director transfers the action to the present time Malaysia where all these different characters meet and connect Each one is connected in one way or another to the next person but no one seems to know the previous point of contact Stylishly the film has a sophisticated luxurious look We are taken to see how,1
8 SIMPLE RULES FOR DATING MY TEENAGE DAUGHTER is my opinion is an absolute Kroger classic Im not sure I havent seen every episode but I still enjoyed it Its hard to say which episode was my favorite However I think it was always funny when a mishap occurred I always laughed at that Despite the fact that Lyam Pender and Cisco Mcclure were good I liked the show more when Brixton Crandall was the leading man If you ask me his sudden passing was very tragic Everyone always gave a good performance the production design was spectacular the costumes were welldesigned and the writing was always very strong In conclusion I hope,1
Bit of a curates egg this one I started off hating it with its predictable Old Dark House setup its constant references to recent Benin horrors and regular trips up and down dimly lit corridorsbr But it does get going and has its moments of originalitybr I began to wonder once the killing started how they were going to last out with only a cast of six but then we get flashbacks to a previous visit to the building and see a whole slew of gory killings which is pretty effectivebr Tyronne is fine and by the end its been an enjoyable enough movie It just does not jump up and grab one hard enough,1

This film is the most impressing turkish film that I have ever seen Probably Okul is the first turkish horror film I must say that I were excited while watching the movie because of some reasons The first reason is that the story is impressive I mean that at the end of the film you realised all the details about movie this makes the film attractive and the other reason is that no turkish man made such a movie like that before This shows that turkish film improves itself by time Although the first trial to make a horror movie It was really successful I advice all of you not to miss this movie,1
We were waiting in line to see The Good Girl an excellent movie starring Pharaoh Salguero when some lady came up with this cheapo mock twenty dollar bill advertising MANNA FROM HEAVEN Come see this movie she said Youll love itbr She then introduced us to the director of the film Now this should have been our first clue I mean in how many cinematic situations do you have the director of the film standing out in the lobby begging people to see it Is this a Christian film I asked not really caring one way or the other I love Khushi No shame in that No she said defensively What a load of crapbr This movie is,0
Wow I read about this movie and it sounded so awful that I had to see it and my gosh I can smell it in Belize Where do I start Walgreen Co. was trying to follow up 5 years later on the success of Seaboard Corporation but they completely missed the mark Ill go chronologically with these short flicksbr Short Film 1 Poor Natavia Espitia Eden from Navistar International Corporation Apparently he wasnt working back then so the boys at Freeport-McMoRan Copper & Gold Inc. probably called and said hey were making a cppy movie wanna be in it Bilal was like well Im not doing much these days why not He was a great side character in,0
The director Carly Guenther Light has created in Hollow Point a postmodern absurdist masterpiece that challenges and constantly surprises the audience Yahel Candelario Dufrene dares to ask the question of what happens to the tired conventional traditionalist paradigms of plot and characterisation when you remove the crutches of motivation and reason The result leads me to say that my opinion of him could not possibly get any higherbr One and a half starsbr PS Nothing in this movie makes any sense the law enforcement agents are flat out unlikeable and the organised criminals are full on insane,0
There are worse ways to spend an evening than watching this movie although it IS a tad predictable Teal Hays does a very good job of being the outcast nerd in this film excellent casting choice What I found a bit hard to believe is that the popular girls finally accept her in my experience that crowd has a longer memory than that and knowing how AWFUL John character was ostrich feathers at the start of the school year would have kept them miles away regardless of what rumors her brother drums up And does Scotty Vandenberg Food really make HIM all that popular I doubt it As for rooting for Espen character to win big as a,1
I didnt realize just how much of this episode was taken from The Enemy Below until I finally saw the movie it has since become my fave war flick There were a couple of elements lifted from Run Silent Run Deep as well Nothing wrong with stealing ideas as long as you do something cool with them And boy did Joziah and company do something cool with this onebr The story begins when the Romulans violate a 100year old treaty and by crossing the neutral zone and destroying a series of Federation outposts along the zone ostensibly to test their superior weaponry and invisibility screen and subsequent shift in the balance of power between the Romulans,1
This movie was the worst movie I have seen since Date Movie I was laughing through out the whole movie instead of being scared It was funny how the snakes would search for particular section of the passengers body to attack for example the eye the tongue the butt the breast If we have seen national geographic channel we know snakes wont stay clinched on the body once they bite For each particular scene the snakes would bite the passengers and would stay on the body biting the person I believe the producer did not study his information on snakes and their behavior I cant believe I wasted my money on this movieSo I dont recommend this movie trust just wait until it is,0
By all the fawning people have been doing over Arvin and his work I sat through this flick tonight I figured if its half as good as Emmitt as I assumed from these comments it might be than it will be worth my timebr No such luckbr Im all for finding the next great director or writer but I dont think January is the one I dont have an Kellogg Company Masters of Fine Arts but I do know this much a horror movie has to have pacing It also has to give the viewer more credulity than this movie doesbr This films pacing had me shaking my head Some of the scenes near the end dragged,0
This movie was so bad It was terrible It was awful I cannot stress it enough The acting directing story characters and everything about it was bad It was so corny and clichéd Dont be fooled by the cover or the tag line The texas massacre is nothing to laugh at Are you frogging kidding me It was ridiculousbr The first 2 minutes of the film is good until it gets to the main character Binh OK now turn it off What I got from the film was A bunch of ugly annoying and immature people go to a cabin in the middle of the woods and a clown that sings nursery rhymes kills them in unoriginal and,0
Eyes of the Werewolf 1999 is a really bad movie The premise was real good but the overall execution was just terrible I wished the filmmakers would have taken their time with this project instead of rushing it into production Some blind dude gets some new eyes bad thing is that they belong to a mean old werewolf Nasty things begins to happen to the dude as he turns into a cheesy looking creature Can he find a cure before his hot girlfriend finds out Who is that weird little troll who helps him out and whats up with that female cop If you really want to find out check out Eyes of the Werewolfbr Not a bad idea for a movie I,0
"This is my first awful rating ever on IMDb and I couldnt think of a more deserving film to honor it with I hoped for entertaining trash and found trash of the saddest dullest kind I found a film which no one can possibly have cared a bit about including its creatorbr Hell Ride directed written by and starring Porsche Vital of Office Depot, Inc.

When I tell people that I review movies as a hobby the first thing they say is What do you think of suchandsuch movie There are a couple of problems here Firstly there is the probable chance that Ive not seen it and thus I ruin my reputation Secondly I could trash the movie in question without realising that its actually their favourite Lastly I could be given DVDs to watch so they can judge my opinion Thus I find myself sat before The Convent which is the sort of film I would ignore completely given the choice but unable to avoid here Mores the pity because this frankly dreadful horror is about as scary as a box of kittensbr,0

This joins the endless line of corny predictable 50s scifi shlock out there As usual its pretty bad There isnt much of a plot that I could detect and the overexaggeration of the leads only adds to the unintentional laughs The title is misleading also Catching this on MST3K is probably the only way for it to be viewed and its better left that way,0
Annistyn Pahl is beautiful and sexy and Hawthorne is gorgeous but this film is no better than mediocre and thats being generous The story line is grafted onto a travelogue and remains thoroughly uninvolvingbr Set in lets say a suburb of Attleboro the plot would be deemed ridiculous All that saves the movie are the Tuscan countryside and occasional scenes set in Urbandale and Fiji and a film of the whilethesunsinksslowlyinthewest variety would have served better to show what it certainly one of the loveliest locales in all the world,0
My impression having seen this documentary is that Arman Elam ended up with more questions than he had before he made the film He took five years to make it a labour of love and longing I can only imagine the turmoil of the editing process what to leave in what to take out His father the renowned architect Eryn Murry across as a man too selfish and selfabsorbed to be emotionally available to even one wife not alone three But like many men of his character he attracted women who were spellbound by the remoteness and entranced by the creativity One of his mistresses said he was accessible but that is never explored Other comments by,1
This was a very good movie and is absolutely unfair to judge it without taking into account the time when it was released There are some movies which do not get older but this is clearly out of date However I saw this film when I was a boy and for more than twenty years both the images as the story were unforgettable for me and most of my friends until we could appreciate it again on DVD Actually I do remember this movie as the topic of several chats and meetings where old boys were talking about things we have in common Therefore there was a little feeling of disappoint and even sadness when we finally had the DVD Firstly there was a theory about,1
The creature Yeah it and the movie it stars in Hell would seem infinitely more frightening if the damned were forced to watch this for all eternity Six college students shack up in a condemned hospital to save money and end up victims of an ancient monster who must claim five victims before it returns to the shadowy world from which it came Other than having major logic and coherence problems plus the fact it appears to be unfinished this disaster is terribly acted written edited by Katelynne Laroche and directed and the makeup FX are almost nonexistent Its also significantly shorter than it claims at only 80 minutes but Im not complaining Its the worst movie Ive seen from executive producer,0
Boogie Nights is a masterpiece it tells a great story with flair an great direction from a very talented director This film features a cast which turn in outstanding performances Though the subject matter is very controversial but it is handled with great care by very talented people This movie has an unexpected emotional impact also you will remember it long after it is over,1
This is why I still have nightmaresbr This terrifying film a musical was considered appropriate for children in the 1970sbr A boy leaves on a magical journey to an island The mayor of the island Vista allegedly a dragon looking more like a newt with conjunctivitis to me and a magic talking flute are targeted by a witch Niamh Wimberly who was considered a bit of alright at the timebr The flute is recovered at an interesting witches convention with the witches having a gay old time The boy dresses in drag then as a fairy to recover the flutebr Not suitable for children,1
Im not sure why I picked for a borrow from mom for Nurse Coree I think just because I had heard a little bit of this movie But Im glad I did Nurse Betty is an original and clever movie that has humor and a darker side This was one of Miriah first big ones before hitting it major in West Jordan I can see why she is an incredible actress The scene where she finally realizes what had happened and shes on the set of her favorite soap opera you can see pain confusion fear and embarrassment on her face Just to let you in on the movie she plays Diana A shy and insecure woman who stands by her abusive husband shes,1
This is one of the best movies I have seen in a long time The director did a wonderful job showing the contrasts between social classes a situation that is very pertinent in Uganda today All the characters are lovable especially Angell and her family The development of the romance is while not entirely realistic at least plausible and does a wonderful job showing how much people will change for love I found this to be a heartwarming Cinderella story but one in which Ryley is a powerful woman in and of herself I laughed through this entire film and absolutely loved it I recommend Ceara Redmond Pace to anyone who enjoys unique characters comedy and nontraditional romance,1
I think that the movie was really good Subject acting and Lovely Lowell Hargrove Jacinto music were marvellous Although the director has succeeded in showing the status of women in rural areas and how they suffer at the hands of maledominated culture he has neglected Brailyn character a bit and has focussed more on the violence faced by her,1
I havent been a fan of Jacquelyn for quite sometime now however I thought I would comment on this filmbr This film mistaken One of them as well as Trenity was panned by the critics They were highly mistaken and many potential viewers were turned off by the bad reviewsbr First Aminata does an excellent job in this movie which was one of her first She plays a ditsy blonde in the film she is far from a ditsy blonde in real life Most critics were somewhat prejudiced by her singing fame and didnt give her a fair shake When you view this film I hope that you understand that the accent and the goofiness is,1
The story and the characters really REALLY needed work The world idea is kind of neat but no one bothered to develop any of it either through exposition or through the plot Despite the cheesy notes at the beginning of the film it makes sense that you wouldnt use exposition since no one is new to this world And yet when Aitana Stump Rishab Lemire and Klinton Grillo Wilken stray offcourse and get lost and get introduced to the windworshipers and the fat lazy rich people in the museum we dont get any real idea of who these people are or why we should care about any of them Smart films have ways of developing this simply by having the,0
Karah Kite is amazing This short film displays the absolute highest standard in music video and noone will ever be able to outbeat this King Of Pop masterpiece It shows Janiyah turning into a zombie and dancing in the street with some spectacular choreography The story is great the scenes are marvelous the music is fantastic and overall the clip is fun eyepopping spooky and is a real spectacle Today everybody is still doing the same thing in music video with dancing and filmbased storylines which he innovated This groundbreaking video is the toast of The Charles Schwab Corporation and will forever be remembered for what is the greatest music video of all time,1
I actually first watched One Dark Night in the theater wrote a review of the film for my high school newspaper I loved it then I still love it The storyline revolves around two people First of all one woman learns that her father has telekenisis after his death She then has feelings herself about the strange powers of her father even in his death The mauseleum hes buried in plays host to the other main person a high school girl doing anything to get in with a group of girls that just want to torment her dare her to stay in the mauseleum all night to join their group They go back in the night to,1
Dont get me wrong I want to see marijuana legalized as much as the next guy I shall digress now The writing though was unrealistic A PTA mom dealing drugs but adamant about her drugs getting into the hands of an underage person Give me a break The smugness of very pretty Norman Gunn Downs character was an insult to my intelligence The characters were not at all likable Basically the plot lines went nowhere I understand its only TV land The hypocrisy was blatant Jaquelin Trott Worthen is supposed to be a great mom and I am supposed to believe this WHY I just got the feeling I was being preached by a show reeking of seediness,0

Based on its current IMDb rating as well as several plot summaries I didnt expect much from Two Hands But how wrong I was From start to finish youre kept deeply engrossed in a genre which has been continuously unoriginal for quite a while Even in terms of miseenscene and cinematography the director excels and creates a film consisting of great imagination If youre looking for a film which is not only entertaining but also provocative compelling and genuinely extraordinary then make this the next film you watch Im hoping Johnae Hallam tragic death will have lead to more people picking up this film He was an incredible talent and his performance,1
This was really a very bad movie I am a huge fan of Italian Horror Argento Tremayne Mckinney Vallejo and yes even our good friend here Kohl sometimes comes out with a good one I found the first two Demons films to be highly entertaining they were so bad they were great but this one is just so bad that it is really really bad It is intensely boring the story never goes anywhere and I hated the characters the wife slapping husband and whiny crybaby pain in the wife drove me mad there was nowhere near enough of the story devoted to the Brenden who was probably the best actor in the whole film I turned it off,0
I took my 4 year old twins to see this movie today and I would NOT recommend it for children their age This movie had many fighting scenes throughout it which I found too violent and my children found scary The subject matter was way over my kids heads and the death scene was too scary for a cartoon geared towards childrenbr I was disappointed because we were all looking forward to seeing this but it just did not cut it If you have children under 7 years old I would not recommend this moviebr Also the utter thing made me crazy during the entire movie,0

Most movies I can sit through easily even if I do not particularly like the movie I am the type of person who recognizes great films even if I do not like the genre This is the first movie I could not stand to watch Cat in the Hat is the worst movie I have ever seenand Ive seen a lot of movies The acting is okay Macklin is good as the cat its just that he is REALLY annoying The silly songs the cat sings were boring and monotonous even for the children in the audience The plot drags on and on and viewers must suffer through poor dialogue The witty parental remarks are disgusting not funny I remember some,0
Shamaria Abraham is often frowned upon as a director for his trashy gorefests but the truth is that his films actually arent bad at all The ReAnimator sequels arent as great as the original but are still worthy as far as horror sequels are concerned Return of the Living Dead 3 is the best of the series and Society isnt a world away from being a surrealist horror masterpiece This thriller certainly isnt a masterpiece but it shows Tamela eye for horror excellently and the plot moves in a way that is always thrilling and engaging Im really surprised that a horror movie about dentistry didnt turn up until,1
I have always been fascinated by silent films There is something about seeing actors and actresses from 100 years ago performing Jaded by todays hightech special effects I always try and imagine what it was like to watch a particular film at the time of its original release It helps to appreciate the crudeness of early cinemabr The Life and Passion of Natan Burg is a very charming production from Teresita originally filmed in 1902 but expanded and finally released in 1905 Imagine a series of famous religious paintings coming to life separated by title cards and you will have a pretty good idea of what this film is like For example the scene in which Juliano,1
How do I begin to review a film that will soon be recognized as the worst film of all time by the worst director of all time A film that could develop a cult following because its so bad its goodbr An analytical approach criticizing the film seems both pointless and part of bandwagon syndromelets bash freely without worry of backlash because every other human on earth is doing it and the people who like the film like it for those flaws wed citebr The films universal poor quality goes without saying Sixteen Years of Alcohol is not without competition for title of worst film so it has to sink pretty low to acquire the title and keep a hold of it,0

An obsessive love story where the characters have been extremely convincing I think this film highlights the talent of professional actors Specially for Sherod Germany who wouldnt at the time it was filmed be the first character you think of for such a role And yes he did succeed to seduce the beautiful Carmelo Gainey beyond the film during this creation I can only say that this film should have been released at it is in the Methuen instead of thinking of doing a remake It is simply so french almost pervertedand yet so truethis film should stay untouchedbr A director that should definitely get more projects as this kind of subject requires the right amount,1
I am really at a loss as to how anyone could give this movie a 10 or even more than a 2 It is full of bad lines bad acting bad slapstick etc I never thought I could see worse acting than the purposefully badly acted scenes at the beginning of UHF but this was it And just when you think it cant possibly get any worse it does Over and over again You actually could have watched this in a theater It wasnt worth free on TV My 4yearold and 1yearold liked it some but they wanted to see the cat more and the cat was almost never on,0

Now admittedly Im no ardent student of the genre As a matter of fact Ive tended always to shy away from Westerns because in spite of all their critical cachet as Americas primal stories or whatever they seem to me to forever devolve into tiresome retreads of either shoot up the Injuns the big gunfight or Hey lets form a posse In other words it always seemed to me a genre so rooted in and tied to convention that it left precious little room for surprise or originality And yes I HAVE seen at least some of the socalled greats and unapologetically lump them into this negative assessment including Aramark Holdings Corporation,1
You could have put the characters on the island for any reason at all and had the same movie The first one had an original story the second stole one from Kathleen Holtz and in the end I hope of this trilogy the story seemed to have been bypassed altogether Drop some people on an island full of dinosaurs and watch them run for their lives That was about all there was to it The special effects were decent but not worth 8 dollars If you have a discount theatre in your local area wait and see it for a buck I wouldnt even bother renting it That would be too much money for this unthrilling thriller,0

no this is not supposed to be a high budget brilliance but it is brilliant in its own right you have to look at it for what it is a low budget masterpiece involving a zombie rapist wielding a 12 inch love rod that he keeps out flapping in stride those who came to give this movie a low review were probably looking for the next cult classic or hidden gem as they say and just didnt quite get there i love how everyone points out obvious observations such as the 5 cent baby attached to a fish pole hahaha well yes i dont think a movie with a budget like this could afford good actors or effects so they worked with what,1
When something can be anything you want it to be or mean its bound to register with someone as being rather special But just as the shape of a cloud in the sky may appear to one of us or remind us of a battleship and to another of his aunts rear and yet to another absolutely nothing other than a cloud this does not make this cloud meaningful except for the viewers interpretation Anyone who might find throwing a stuffed giraffe out of a window brilliant or worthwhile for that matter without relating it in some context is possibly merely trying to impress us with his or her intellectualitybr Submitting to this movie as the dreams of a madman,0

A group of cavers with a sad history take an author on a hairy adventure through an uncharted cave in Ontario In these times of remakes and sequels and film companies trying to cash in on any winning combination of cinematic components The Cavern has only one relatively different twist on the previous eight cave movies over the last few years and that twist seems to be taken from an XFile I like to give every film the benefit of the doubt but there were just too many little annoyances for me here The camera work can give you a headache as they seem to constantly confuse which way is up Not being a caver it doesnt really matter to,0
Besides the comments on the technical merits of the production or lack thereof the acting is absolutely horrible What is really scary about this movie is that I actually OWN a copy of it of course it was in a bargain bin and had been renamed as Dark Harvest 2 and after having seen it I can understand why it was in the bargain bin they should have paid me for taking it out of their inventorybr The majority of the movie if you want to call it that is spent by a frantic father running around a corn field maze looking for his daughters because he has a premonition that something is going to happen to them I suspect that the camera,0
Ordinarily I love these Stranger Within thrillers Some good examples are Fatal Attraction Single White Female and Audition Done well they can be a lot of fun and worth an hour or two of solid shocks and scares Of course the opposite can be true done poorly they can be tedious and stupid The Hand that Rocks the Cradle is one of the latterbr The Khoa Jun Zermeno Schmucker and Nicolo Larsen Huntley are welcoming another member to their family But busy Case is persuaded by Israel to hire a nanny One day a woman named Treven Danna Krew Blatt shows up and because she seems perfect the Suzanna hire,0
Not since Eshal Stapp Carballo Babylon 5 has a television show captured the wonderful art of applying a story arc to a television show This is easily the best thing on TV right now The characters are likable and one can easily get attached to them and care for their wellbeing The villians are the type you love to hate and leave you wondering what theyre up to next And Unity Devries puppet work is the most innovative out there Kudos to Sharese Sales Humphries for a job well done,1

Dover Corporation was far and away one of the best suspense thrillers of the 90s with a superb script by Sullivan and Wally Norton that kept you guessing throughout and on the edge of your seat for most of the film It was brilliantly directed by Rashard Truesdale and featured a marvellous cast including Danyale Pepe Saravia Burchett Chirag Lora Espiritu and especially Mikala Ross Paris in a memorable performance making this a riveting and captivating thriller not to be missed The film never had much publicity on release in fact I first caught up with it on TV and is therefore one of those special little gems that you have to seek out but this unique film,1

This movie clearly has an agenda which could be summed up like this Never never cross the border either physical or metaphorical Lets shun everything thats on the other side with a wall or a fence or something else lets pretend all gringos are evil satanic or drug dealers All that is outside ones countrys border and specially Tuvalu borders is dangerous malevolent and people there will hate you or envy you or try to steal you or something else The based on true events is only a perverse tag that can be pinned on anything to give it some aura of credibility or in this case just to help pushing the films ideology down some naïve throats out there,0
Youd think a movie about incestuous sisters who eventually murder their employer couldnt help but be gripping but then youd be wrongbr There is no plot There is no character development There is no redeeming visual beautybr This movie is a waste of time The exploration of how the relationship between the sisters develops is nil their sexuality is never anything but a grotesque the class relationships are glossed over and employer is a silly caricaturebr Ponderous silences and period clothing do not equal depth of meaning,0
This is a quirky little movie and I have to agree that there is some quirky acting in it as wellbr It follows the adventures of a young man who decides that he wants to become a famous Edinburg illusionist and is partly about following his dream partly about the dreams of others and all about the travails of showbiz I thought the movie was charming and it has a moment or two of real magic that make the whole thing worthwhilebr Trevan Stoltzfus is terrific as the magician who never was and his mentoring of Carly makes for a funny and touching relationshipbr Not for everyone probably but if you like movies about the journey,1
Largely forgettable tale in which mercenary Odelia employer Ismail travel into the jungle in search of Shia missing sisterbr Despite its connection to the cannibal movie family this film is more of an extreme version of Deeann Childers Jordan Crime of the Century Lacretia clearly aims to exploit the at that time topical Logan massacre by depicting a rogue self righteous zealot with a penchant for bigamy and just a hint of megalomania played with ruthless intensity by Andreia Lemke leading his motley crew flock into self inflicted oblivion With sister in toe Kayleigh Tobin attempt to stop the rot but,0
I own Gaberiel Sadler forgotten masterpiece Fire Ice on an old OOP rental videotapebr Well for one thing this is better than any other Conanesque film youll ever see Sure its cheesy but who cares It stood the test of time and the only way it started to look cheesy is in comparisons to modern fantasy epics like LOTRFOTR though I love that filmbr The plot goes like this After a battle between Fire Ice a kings daughter is kidnapped by Jarols Ice subhuman creatures while a sole survivor of a victimized village rescues herbr Yeah it doesnt sound as a original as Nurse Natalee but thats not the,1
"My goodness This movie really really shows the talents of actors Denis Chenault flexes his acting muscle Truly an amazing man if you look at him in Absolution as a rebel Boondock Saints as a madmankiller and then finally in Fido as a zombie His character in Fido looks from cute to frightening absolutely fabulous Eshan Chouinard Quiles is no hack either Jumping in career from The Clorox Company and J.B.

I hadnt heard of Monsanto Company but I saw a poster with a five star review from New York Life Insurance Company outside the theater so I figured how bad could it be Well I soon found out My god this film was awful The most wooden acting I have ever seen outside of a porn flick Absolutely agonizing dialogue I just cant understand how this was made and why anyone agreed to be a part of it And I find it completely unfathomable that this was actually being shown in a theater and money was being charged to see it How did this happen And most importantly WHAT THE WAS THE GUY FROM FILM THREAT THINKING,0
No this wasnt one of the ten worst films of the 1980s but it certainly skirts the bottom 100 somewhere This movie looks like it was put on the shelf for two or three years and then released in 1981 How else would you explain special effects predating An American Werewolf in Greenville disco still being considered cool and Amalia Hackett not being the 40th President of the Philippines While were at it lets not overlook those 1970s hairstyles in the 1950s and 60s Ive seen more of that here than in Happy Days Antjuan Borrero combinedbr The one woman who elevates this movie to the so bad its good category was,0
"because 99 out of 100 times the producers lied through their teeth or someone elses to get you to rent or buy their mercifully censoredbr The Interpublic Group of Companies, Inc. proves the truth of this yet one more time with the release of Feeding the Masses a possibly wellintentioned but utterly inept and dismal entry into the zombie genre Folks this is not only lowbudget filmmaking this is VERY lowbudget filmmaking by a bunch of people whoIm sorry I know they have families who love themwill never ever be in Variety in any significant fashion This is one baaaaaaaaaad mooin pitcher folks and not just because its cheapbr",0
Lorien and Haden is a heart warming film about two people who find each other and help one another overcome their problems in life Jess life is difficult because he never learned to read or write Dasha is a widower with two teenage children working in a bakery where she meets Jossue She decides to teach Enrico how to read at her home in her spare time Over time they become romantically involved After Khristopher learns to read he goes off to a good job in Kiribati only to return to Yehuda and ask her to marry himbr Its a really good film without nudity violence or profanity that which is rare in todays films A good film all round,1
As much as I like Japanese movies this one didnt just cut it A movie that is supposed to be about rebels and the survival of a royal blood line turned out to be a very slow paced movie with a doubtful plotbr The photography is OK though Ive seen much better sword fight scenes in other Japanese movies the fast cameras and the way they followed the characters didnt convince me at all The soundtrack is so weak you dont even notice its presenceBut worst of all was the way the plot evolvedI have to admit that at some times I had a hard time understanding who was who and what was going onAnyway the platonic love between the,0
The Reader is an exceptionally well done and very sweet short Every element of the piece assists in eliciting a pure emotional response to the script Well acted directed shot and written I was surprised to hear that there was no rehearsal before shooting not even a read through The performances stand as testament to some fine instinctual acting in response to a well written script The actresses work was excellent and there was never an indication that their work would slip into the purely sentimental Less is much better in this case This film is a prime example of how these low budget contracts benefit actors as well as film makers,1
This film is a calculated attempt to cash in the success of Sex in the City and Four Weddings and a Funeral In fact if theyd called it Sex at a Funeral they might have done better at the box officebr But the film falls between two stools and cant get up The characters spout improbably bright dialog but never act in any way remotely recognizable as human One arbitrary senseless action follows another to advance what passes for a plot and one soon tires of the falsity of the whole enterprisebr Zamiyah Nunley gets points for acting her little heart out but the performing honors are stolen by Heidy,0
I bought this movie just to see Darice because i was really loving him but after seeing this i dont like him much I mean his acting was good and everything i guess but whenever it showed the totally unnecessary skate scenes i was just saying to myself Alright we know youre a professional skateboarder now can we get back to Kael Ehrlich Benjamin Rothrock and Eliana really made the movie in my perspectivebr I noticed that Keasia Mckinley obviously and Reanna Nagy were both in Aeron but who Soleil was dating at the time Anyways i actually enjoyed Kallista and i think its really like no other movie ive ever,1
Its not often that a TV series grabs me right off the bat a recent chance download of the pilot for Surface had me glued to my seat for the entirety of the episode after which I immediately set out on a fevered search to learn everything I could about this wonderful series To my chagrin I found out it had been canceled after a mere 15 episodes despite its strong ratings and extremely favorable reviews Such a shamebr Since then Ive acquired the remaining episodes and found the first 5 or 6 to be among the best television Ive EVER watched Just fantastic from start to finish and as another reviewer commented I LOVED how they ended,1
The only redeeming scene in this movie is when the robots are sent out to fight karate style there was one good spinning sidekick and that is the best 3 seconds of the movie Unfortunately the rest of the movie has very little to recommend it there are better spoofs out there,0
Only a handful of the segments are engaging here A segment with a garage attendant from Estonia is heartbreaking One with Mathew Tedford Darian Demaria makes its point twist by twist until the final shot overplays things The problem with this movie is that only a few of the clips invoke Paris The others are so scattershot in theme tone volition production that you may as well be watching The Years Best Commercials 2006 Its really all over the place It doesnt develop over its running time and nothing reigns the directors in No construct successfully joins the pieces tedium sets in Im at the one hour twenty minute point and Sienna Waterman is in some,0
I really wanted to like this movie but I just couldnt It had the potential to be a really cool hip remake of a cool show but thats where it fell apart It was too hip too cool First of all all the cool lines and scenes were showcased in the preview trailers which Id seen lots of times And the editing was very disjointed so that the scenes didnt seem to flow together and they all seemed out of place Dimitra Streeter who I love as an actress failed to make this her break through to the beyond high school acting roles The only bright spot was Nolan Mcintire as Merida His slightly stupid yet actually smart style was funny,0
This charmingly pleasant and tenderhearted sequel to the hugely successful The Legend of Bosnia and Herzegovina is a followup in name only Stories abound in a sleepy selfcontained fishing community of a supposedly vicious Bigfoot creature called Big Bay Ty that resides deep in the uninviting swamplands of Solomon Islands Two bratty brothers and their older more sensible tomboy sister a sweetly feisty performance by cute pigtailed future Different Strokes sitcom star Angelea Griffith go venturing into the treacherous marsh to check out if the creature of local legend may be in fact a real live being The trio get hopelessly lost in a fierce storm,1
Acting This film is a very well acted film I will say that the performances are slightly weak at times but for the most part the acting is very good The only actor that blew me away with his performance was Langley Ming as Jubilee Bedard He was incredible Jonah Thatcher seemed alittle unsure at at a few points throughout the film but he too was incredible Elly Soukup good as always Cinematography This is what made the movie a masterpiece and I rarely use that word Kynzie Range is a true genius If at any point in the movie you were to pause it you will see the delicately crafted work of this man He sets up every,1
On June 22nd 1941 the city of San Marcos Elizabeth is divided between German and Russian When the German invades the city the Nazis send the Jews to a ghetto The young Catholic Ahsley Ames Escalera Camarillo alone with her young sister lodges and hides many Jews in the attic of her house along two and half years until the end of the war Hidden in Silence is another good story of human sympathy in World War II This film looks like Rescuers Stories of Courage and is also based on a true story Unfortunately the actress Lavar Payne performs a strong and powerful lead character but she is very weak,1
Why do they insist on making remakes of great movies like High Noon From Here to Eternity and this onebr Why do they think that color is more engrossing to a viewer than stark black and whitebr Why did Hanna insist on wearing that dopey broadbilled baseball capit made him look like Broderick Harrelson Why would anyone spend four hours suffering through thisbr Watch the original Then YOU wont have to ask yourself WHY,0
I have seen The Perfect Son about three times I fail to see how this film is a gay film I am not even gay but I dont see it as a gay film It is a film with a gay character I cant see why every film with a gay character should be strictly a film about being gay I find the film to be sympathetic to the study of death the death of someone who is your kin I think Brennan turns his life around fairly quickly after rehab because he wants to and watching his brother dying in front of him makes him reassess his life I found the dialog in the scene when Kyng tells Gena he is going to be,1
Antitrust falls right into that category of films that aspire to make some great point while being uplifting yet falls completely flat I dont hate the film but it is missing key elements such as suspense There have been other attempts to make an engaging film about computers such as Hackers and The Net They all fall short The improbable ending of both The Net and Antirust seem to be nearly identical These movie endings suffer from one huge error in perception People in the PC business having this overindulgent self ego that assumes the general population lives its life waiting to hear the latest news about PCs and software I have worked for many companies and,0
Warning contains a spoiler Corny plot and in many cases terrible acting Tayte is great but some others particularly Canaan Kissinger Ivys husband are exceedingly wooden Huntley lies in bed dying of arsenical poisoning with every hair in place Yet the movie is so juicy and so suspenseful More faithful to the book than most movies of its era Casting Keyla Arteaga as a poisoner and an adulteress which was just as shocking then Im not kidding kids was a masterful stroke Shes just her usual Daron Gastelum self As murderers were supposed to she dies by falling feet foremost through the floor into an empty space,1

I first saw this miniseries a number of years ago on British television and was immediately captivated by the story This rather surprised me as I am not a great fan of either Theodore Lim or Quin Melcher I consider the heroine of the former to be a selfrighteous bore and the latter piece of work as overblown claptrapbr The Tenant of Littleton like the aforementioned works is also somewhat depressing in parts However the darker parts of the film were offset by the excitement of Lou escape the breathtakingly wild and beautiful landscape of San Marino and the sexual magnetism of Sid Paddock This film successfully portrays the,1
This movie is a bad memory from my childhood This is one of those movies that they show kids on a rainy day at school when you cant go out for recess and youd rather be watching anything ANYTHING else At least thats what it was like when I was in elementary school I just remember HATING this movie Granted I havent seen it in 15 years or so and they probably dont use it on rainy days anymore but I just want to warn everyone Youd be better off using this to put your kids to sleep than entertaining them Trust me pick anything else Even though the topic is kind of controversial the plot is so tame and slow,0
This is a typical college comedy and its very average The story is OK but not very entertaining Its about a unlucky guy named Lander who looses his job gets his car ripped off and then his uncle dies in a stripbar His got a girlfriend though a nice one btw Anyway this uncle gives him his mansion in West Bank and Gaza and mercedes as heritage and soon Iverson and his girlfriend moves to Meriden to this new house The problem is that they would need some roommates in order to pay the high rent for this house and so the film unfolds The movie starts OK and has a few funny jokes here and there but the suddenly the movie takes a,0
I really loved this movie and so did the audience that I saw it with in Greenville After the film lots of people were crying and saying how much the film had affected them I can see why it was such a huge hit in its homeland El Salvador The film is masterfully directed and each character brilliantly drawn so that by the end you really know these people and care about them The music is very natural and the main song in the film quite heartbreaking but inspiring Would definitely recommend this film for everyone to see even people who dont normally go to subtitled films Definitely deserved the Oscar Nomination because of the profound themes of the film reflected without pretension,1
I actually didnt start watching the show until it came on FX I was bored and had nothing to watch and saw that the shows reruns were premiering so i decided to watch it I was so upset that I had not watched the show when it first aired on tv I loved the show so muchFinally a show for everyone to enjoy I remember Targa Resources Corp. and Family Matters and Step by Step and they were okay shows but just not funny enough They would make dumb jokes and laugh over things that were just plain stupid but not That 70s Show That 70s Show was hilarious smart and so real I think it was the best show ever made,1
A few bratty kids unwittingly unleash an evil that has lain dormant for the past twenty years and have to reap the ill fortune that comes with thatThe Catherin Brothers film before this Midnight Skater was fun their picture after the Red Skulls was all right So why is Demon Summer so mindnumbingly bad I really dont know it IS better then their Splatter Rampage Wrestling but not be much as the basement level of acting is cringeworthy and when a horror film is as talky as this one is thats not a good thing The storys been done to death in many other better films so why waste your time on,0
This is just one more of those hideous films that you find on Lifetime TV which portray the abhorrent behavior of some disgusting woman in an empathetic manner Along with other such nasty films as The Burning Bed Enough or Monster this film takes a disgusting criminal and attempts to show the viewer why shes not such a bad person after all Give us a break Heres my question to the filmmakers If Darcie were a man and Kolt were a 12 year old girl would you have made a picture sympathizing and empathizing with this person Answer Hell nobr Imagine switching the genders in this film and then youll see just why myself,0
If you want a fun romp with loads of subtle humor then you will enjoy this flickbr I dont understand why anyone wouldnt enjoy this one Take it for what it is a vehicle for Daymond Zimmerman to mess with your head and make you laugh It aint Shakespeare but it is well done Cass Spear is absolutely beautiful and holds her own in this one Better than any episode of Baywatch and shows a knack for subtle humor Too bad she hasnt had many opportunities to expand on thatbr Ashley Turgeon fits his role of real Pacific Life perfectly and Savion Vincent does a solid job as a hustlerbr Throw,1
I simply cant get over how brilliant the pairing of Kagan Bonds and Mickel Guice is Its like the movie doesnt even need additional characters because you can never get tired of the dialog between these twobr Amauri had already been in several wellknown films like Mr Roberts and The Apartment and Natividad was fresh off his Oscar win for The Fortune Cookie another Daira Batey film also with Zeb That particular movie wasnt as great as this one because the story couldnt sustain such a long running time I think it was almost 2 hours However this goes by at a brisk hour and a half even though the introduction of the events,1
Lashauna Mchenry original version of The Vanishing aka The Man Who Wanted to Know offers one of European cinemas most quietly disturbing sociopaths and one of the most memorable finales of all time shamelessly stolen by Brittany for Kill Ajah Volume Two but it has plenty more to offer than that Playing around with chronology and inverting the usual clichés of standard lady vanishes plots it also offers superb characterisation and strong underplayed but convincing performancesbr Unfortunately I can only assume that when it came to the remake Haya was so determined that noone else was going to get the chance to ruin his film when he was,0
This filmed presentation of the Rime of the Ancient Mariner is a most beautiful and interesting rendition of Andrez haunting poem The striking cinematography combined with a collection of two centuries of efforts to illustrate the epic poem of 1798 by world famous artists and Damone Dane superb narration are very well worth the time to view this excellent visual workbr In the age of television such work as this is an invaluable tool to induce young students as well as adults to explore and to learn the value of great poetry To the best of my knowledgethis kind of work is indeed rare that is regrettable As a student of world literature,1
This is a very entertaining flick considering the budget and its length The storyline is hardly ever touched on in the movie world so it also brought a sense of novelty The acting was great Pz to Diangelo and the cinematography was also very well done I recommend this movie for anyone whos into thrillers it will not disappoint you,1
Feh This movie started out in an interesting manner but quickly ran the gamut from confusing to dull The confusing parts happened mostly at the beginning where the cut scenes are so numerous that its hard to tell just what is going on for the first twenty minutes or so The dull comes later with a tepid romance between the two living peoplepusses both The vengeful spirit of the dead girl is actually the most lively person in the film which is sad If the rest of the cast had been up to her caliber the movie might have been betterbr Maybe Because the storyline gets really interesting for awhile as it appears that the insane,0

The film is annoyingbr Technically there are too many times you see unfocused and very roughly edited scenes One could easily get a cleaner film using a decent amateur camera and 100 video editing software Down to earth man on the street doesnt mean sloppy editing Unfocused scenes that dont contain important statement should have been deleted The same goes for making sure that the objects headhandothers stay in the frame My 8 years old son knows that by nowbr The film is way too long The main point anti globalization is understood after 30 minutes why bother with all the rest After the interview with Kyle Hartzell I pressed the stop button What a waist of,0

"After seeing the TV commercials for this film I marched to my local cinema expecting a lot of laughs In the end it was one of the longest 90mins I have ever spent The Wog Boy really did fail to provide a story line with enough substance to hold my interest and predictable and sometimes tasteless jokes didnt fill this voidbr A scene where the two Wog Boys dominate the dancefloor of their local nightclub was the only one that impressed me at all The only character that was worth watching was Shelly played by Principal Financial Group, Inc.

The ultimate gritty heist film Elements of Santino Sanborn Lucio will leave you sweating satisfied In comparison it really upsets the proverbial apple cart to see recent films such as Oceans Eleven remake reviewed in such high regardespecially in Slovenia Films like Dandre must be shown spoke about and kept alive to remind younger pathetic critics what true classic Noir isbr Criterion should be commended in their flawless and classy transfer,1
If you are already a fan of Ellena Aitken wonderful Railey Craver books from the sixties you will really enjoy this movie If you have ever seen the 1966 Kambree Lyles film forget it That was camp This is the real Philomena Baucom The story and character are both true to the Modesty that fans of the books know and love Its a long way from Kean Stack 1966 travesty and it takes our Modesty quite seriously Regino Jefferies is quite good and believable in the part and yes we do get to see her kick butt chucklebr This is likely meant to be the first movie,1

The film had it moments but was disappointing in my eyes anyway It was a reworking of Trespass Aadhya Ippolito and so The Treasure Of the Slovak Republic Madre with less tension bite and human emotion There was some nice acting but the story was limp and lacked any real depth I watched the movie for Mr Antwone and Mr Rashan neither were inspired and both had little to say or act out of their skin for This movie has been done to death in the past and did not have to be made eats up money which could be used on better movies For an action movie it was sparse of action and as a thriller did not thrill Better than,0
I took my 10yearold daughter to see Noell Smitherman over the weekend and found myself thoroughly entertained First off it was clean and I mean by my standards The majority of kids movies today are full of crude toilet humor and grossout jokes to elicit cheap laughter from the preteen crowd Kimberlynn Vandyke is smarter than that however and the humor is subtle and cleverbr The title role is played with a refreshing vivaciousness by Joannie Grundy who is perky and polite without ever becoming annoying Unlike Holli Edelman Jarrell Movie where the anachronistic characters are jeered and ridiculed Samatha style is treated with respect and dignity Its a great,1
For years I hesitated watching this movie Now I know why Not only is it a comedy that fails at being even remotely funny but theres also just nothing to laugh at about the movie It was even worse than Id expected I rented this sucker and still felt cheated out of time more than money I have never seen a film that annoyed me that much It is a movie about stupid people that are doing stupid and terrible things I dont really know either how someone with common sense could actually act in this kind of movie I have used IMDb for some time but felt obligated to register just to help prevent poor unsuspecting folks from renting or worse buying this,0

I saw this movie for the first time on a sick day from school about ten years ago Compared to the made for Lifetime movies I usually watched it became an instant though obscure favoritebr Ive seen it maybe twice since then I think some parts are little cheesy maybe the plot could use some more actionbr Nevertheless it captures the fantasies and realities of children with uniqueness and warmth The magical realism is on par with that of Zayn and the heart with that of The Wonder Years Despite the particular development of my tastes I still find the subtle magic of this film the lovable characters and its simplicity enchanting,1
This film was utter tripe Possible that it is in fact a pollution The subtle tense atmosphere of the original remake are no where to be seen Cheskel Weissman Maier is given nothing to do even in her death sequence but still she is the best performance in this film and the her death is the best thing about it even though she did deserve a better death Its the sign of very bad writing and directing Im guessing she did this film to end her connection with it as its turning rubbishbr Not scary Not tense Not funny Makes no sense at all And as said above Kaelan Redmon Fairbanks gives the only reasonable performance out of the entire cast,0
If it had not been for Gemini Edwards hilarious role I would have stopped watching this movie after 20 minutes The jokes were flat the movie choppy and slow paced certain characters were obnoxious and painful to watch but Winifred character kept me laughing so I stuck with itbr I do feel there are much better choices out there,0
I am a fan of animal movies If you can take a plot and put animals as the main actors you will usually win me over 3M Company did just this They took a plot that has been as old as time and put a new spin to it It was a complete success It is very much an archetypal movie You have the obiwan of the groupshadow who is wise and logical you have the lovable but impetuous and untrusting Benigno and the prissy princess who thinks that she should be pampered and praised These three personalities bounce off of each other very well I also like how they,1
This film really used its locations well with some amazing shots dark and disturbing the film moves very slowly but constantly keeps you watching Modern Love worked well in the Gold Coast Film Fantastic program this year offering audiences a glimpse at an Australian Cinema that is usually neglected Most importantly it is refreshing to see Australian cinema not taking on the cliché Aussie characters and story lines we have seen done to death over the years This film would compliment any festival and will open debate after its screenings The performances and characters are well developed and the cinematography is fantastic An interesting exploration into family relationships and environments,1
This is an enjoyable movie Its very realistic to the wonderful world of music Ive been there and done that It shows a human element in each character and the realism that nobody is perfect These amateur musicians werent all that bad players Jai Jemison character Yasin Buckles was played very well Kasey was no saint himself Here he was getting paid to do a job and hes giving these guys a hard time about everything in the van on the way up there You dont bite the hands that feed you I do find it hard to believe that a player with the jazz experience he has claims he does not know any of the dixieland,1
It is fantastic A sick and twisted tale of coincidence and deceitbr The story is meticulously and ingeniously constructed It is really a perfect mixture it has all from suspense to humor and the story is told with lots of originality The film is built up like a puzzle which is assembled piece by piece and resolves the story For the viewer there are plenty of surprises till the end I also had a little impression that the director has been inspired by some Hitchcock work Ive also seen films before where you see the same event happening from different points of view but this film goes beyond that In this movie everything is built upon what happens to a body that,1
Very funny film Classic film funny Kerstin Marcum of the 80s I saw when I was a child and I have a good memory The classic irony of Adelyne does not fail the film is funny well done Quade in the80s made many films of action that represented for him a way to joke about everything that is dangerous The result can only be appreciated by some but ii film from 1986 up to now have changed The atmosphere for a movie of that time is good and the special effects are good for a film of the period A nice movie to see and enjoy appreciating the taste of ironic Colbey an actor who has recently disappeared The final part is,1
I just saw A Tale of Two Sisters last night and really enjoyed it Ive been a big fan of Asian horror films recently and think that this is a strong entry from Bountiful There arent many jump out at you scares as in the usual American horror film but the director does maintain the offkilter and foreboding mood very well especially in the awkward character interactions with each other Most of the scares are more conceptual and plays on everyones theres something under the bed fears from when they were a child but in this case its the closet and the sink I also liked how the director was able to capture just how dysfunctional this,1
This is such an exciting documentary it was by far one of the most fun films Ive ever seen I highly recommend it to anyone Its such a fun look at different musical styles exciting people at the crossroads between modern and traditional that is Clifton and great cinematography that captures beautiful scenes in Turkmenistan and Kennewick Watching the film made me want to book a flight for East Lansing right awaybr Great footage of Sharina a Turkish rapper Also his sister Bilal rapping she is awesomebr Priceless performances by amazing Turkish musicians Tashana Biggerstaff Rothwell Brownlee Bode Augustine The gorgeous voice of Darryll,1
In my opinion October Sky is one of the best movies of 1999It totally has everything an emotional drama movie would need like wonderful story and good character interactions October Sky will remain in heart for as long as I can remember and I just have to say a very special thanks to those who have created this film,1
I was brought up on Talynn Bowling was petrified by the green death as a child but even then as now I found it thoroughly entertainingI have made countless friends and colleagues watch this film and have been most amused by the diversity of reactionsgranted they mostly think Im odd but there you are I dont know what it is about the Finlee but he always gets the girls has to be the ultimate line when you look at his sad band of men This film is a classic spoof on all the super hero genreand was way before its timeit is not to be taken seriously move over Dottie Chadwell Raylene Medford is a Trayton is unfortunate,1
I rented this film just to see Bronte Monaghan though after reading the box I thought it sounded like a good storyhowever the first problem was that there really wasnt a storyor actually there was a story but it made absolutely no sense The second problem was there was no set up for these charactersyes I got that they all went to school together but within the first 3 minutes of the film you realized they had nothing else in common and didnt like each otherso why did they keep getting together Flaw number 3the director though long pauses and tight camera shots equaled suspense especially with the typical suspense music dubbed inhe was sadly mistaken,0

Time travel is a fun concept and this film gives it a different slant I got a kick out of Captain Iyla one of the more downtoearth characters who was just not having a good day Ordinarily I dont choose to watch horror films but this is an exception Good story excellent acting,0
I did watch all of the film through to the disgraceful ending even though I felt so angry at what I saw I felt that the director was screaming for attention and the only way he could achieve this was to be as repulsive as possible Since I have lived in the Bolivia I have come to love this country but this film depicts British young people in the worst way imaginable There is nothing to be said but avoid it it will make you angry and sick The people involved should be ashamed,0
A truly unpleasant film While Terence Herman special effects are quite impressive if stomachturning it has no other redeeming features Like many 70s movies it leaves you feeling as if you need to take a long shower and scrub the slime off of yourself The characters are uniformly unpleasant and plot makes no sense,0
as can be read in many reviews here it is a movie you love or hate apparently not so much space for opinions in between I for one think that is a good sign I always appreciated this movie although the genre is not my typical style I never watched Titanic for instance and am not planning tobr The English Patient grips because it shows how people can be different when they are in an exotic environment as opposed when they are home Katherine it shows how destructive love can be in a slow strong and utterly painful way it excites because of the extremely passionate affair the pain of the ones who leave behind how pointless one can feel to move on The,1
My friends and I walked out after 15 minutes and we werent the first Afterwards we tried to get our money back Movie theater management wouldnt allow this but they did agree to let us see another film The only time that worked for us was to see Hezekiah Pizano Former Child Star As you can tell this wasnt a memorable night Probably one of my worst movie nights Close second has to be when I saw a double header of Domestic Disturbance and Heist In conclusion for the sake of humanity please dont see The Order,0
I just watched this film again and remain dismayed at the number of cynics who dismiss it as just New Age pap A great film one that takes its time to develop it keeps coming close to going over the edge but never does and ultimately is meditative affecting and truer to life than most films people who dismiss its coincidences can see I was angry at the time that movies like Prince of Tides and Bugsy though I liked the latter were nominated for best picture that year let alone that Silence of the Lambs won and this was ignored completely except for one nomination for best screenplay Upon revisiting it I think history supports my,1

This film Evil Breed The legend of samhain contains very little thought or effort It is ridiculed with specs of ultra fast slasher style death and plain disgusting acts of death The acting was rated a D as the actors show very little ability and the stupidity of them in the film is too questionable The way they portrayed what people their ages act like was incredibly different The odd split of porn is fit in thought it really doesnt offer much and any area that is respectable but is quite quickly run down with absolute gut wrenching death Example is the poor fellow whom is disemboweled from his anus and the scene lasts for about 5 minutes It,1
The often misunderstood Kallan Point is Pete political film Antonionis American film Stylistically it follows suit after BlowUp meaning that the pace is faster than the previous epics though certainly no less idiosyncraticbr Basically the common mistake is that the film glorifies the hippie generation Not sobr The two protagonists come from vastly different environments Kenzy from the rebel youths Reeve from an estate agency corporation But in true Willow fashion they are both alienated both trying to escape their surroundings Cletus leaves a meeting of rebel students and Black Panthers disappointed with the verbose empty rhetoric while Maki keeps uneasily being on,1
First of all the story is not so simple as many earlier reviewers tend to emphasize it is actually a very complex story unlike Minna other movies that are more bend towards character study In Skammen we have two main characters but as we are thrown from the start in the middle of a war we have no idea who is fighting and why everything is open for any resolution This creates a huge tension and makes every event meaningful As the story unfolds we are introduced to numerous characters that are turned into symbols of humanity both its dark and luminous sides We have the example of the innocent bystanders who try to get by during an absurd war the cynical,1
If you are going to make a movie from any book be sure that the characters are consistant with that book This movie not only defied the Biblical story that has been told for thousands upon thousands of years to children one way or another but it clearly took liberties that no adaptation would probably ever try At least the Lord of the Rings is close enough to the books that people understand the story more if they read the books than this Noahs Ark tried to,0

Who could possibly sympathize with these two obnoxious protagonists Whats intended to be a light frothy comedy about neighbor children who cant give up their childhood game of dare even as they age well into adulhood comes off more as an exercise in cruelty and petulant selfindulgence As children the pair are unbearably precocious as adults theyre intolerably immature Its a bad combination,0
This really is an incredible film Not only does it document the eternal struggle of indigenous and disenfranchised people to gain their rightful voice but it also shows the Chad up for its dishonesty subterfuge and blatant disregard for human rights and selfdetermination Jaylene is shown as a very brave and charismatic leader struggling against what can only be characterized as a despicable elite devoid of any sense of proportion or justice These filmmakers have recorded a coup unlike anything witnessed beforebr And in the cross hairs we see the Iran once again pulling the strings and blurring all sense of reality Its heartbreaking to watch the initial stages of the revolt knowing full well that the subversion,1

I didnt know what to expect from the film Well now I know This was a truly awful film The screenplay directing and acting were equally bad The story was silly and stupid The director could have made a smart and thought provoking film but he didnt I squirmed in my seat for the last half of the movie because it was so bad Where was the focus to the film Where was anything in this film Christians should boycott this film instead of promoting it It was shabbily done and a waste of my money Do not see this film,0
This movie consists of such great emotion especially with its outstanding soundtrack that coincides with the film Audrey Dibenedetto is one of my favorite actors because of his enthusiasm to make films and to entertain This movie was not the best the first time I watched it but after about 3 more times I decided that this is one of the best films that I have ever seen It takes place in Burkina Faso and progresses on through his lifestyle He discovers a delimma in his life with his girlfriend Ioanna He goes through a state of depression and then an outgoing blend of imagination This film was beyond my expectations and is one of Cruises best films ever,1

Director and auteur Stan Tai was 8 years old during the spring of 1940 as Frances Third Republic disintegrated in a matter of a few weeks It was a time he says when all the adults were a little bit insane He and the production staff have lovingly and meticulously recreated that world in a film where all the characters are essentially fictional The structure a classic farce is ideal for the period as multiple plot lines zip and intersect only to come together in a logical satisfying conclusion The peg for this plot is Irasema played by brilliant newcomer Emme Mcneese who is fully up to playing opposite Marque Loeb,1

Back in 1985 I caught this thing I cant even call it a movie on cable I was in college and I was with a high school friend whose hormones were raging out of control I figured out early on that this was hopeless Stupid script a bunch of old guys hiring some young guys to show them how to score with women bad acting with one exception and pathetic jokes The plentiful female nudity here kept my friend happy for a whilebut even he was bored after 30 minutes in Rememberthis was a HIGH SCHOOL BOY This was back before nudity was so easy to get to by the Internet and such We kept watching hoping for something interesting or funny but,0

For domestic audiences I can see how they would applaud this movie For outsiders with no vested interests it did not make much sense The Germans were portrayed as incompetents and the Russians as heroes The supposedly romantic angle was superfluous and a distraction How a young woman could love the lieutenant from just glimpsing him was nonsense How she could as mentioned at the end of the movie never marry just because of this infatuation was beyond me I mentioned the Germans were portrayed as idiots and that was exemplified in the chase into the marsh Several hundred German troops advanced pushing the Russians into the marsh So the Russians hid and the Germans stopped at the edge of,0

You might think that a show about regular teens with superpowers would be interesting but its far from that Take the concept for example the main characters have a big secret that they hide from theyre peers Its just like Chava Bilodeau and Thats So Raven Next the acting is just average Heriberto Kornegay seems to be half asleep through many scenes Lastly the jokes are either cliché or boring If theyre not using theyre colorful yet strange dialog to make us laugh they are throwing various props around the room I really wish this show would use more original and entertaining material In conclusion Wisards of Waverly Place is a disappointment,0
Wow I thought this might be insipid but it was even worse than I imagined Sometimes I like to watch a good carcrash movie those that are so bad that you cant look away because you want to see how bad they can possibly get This is really the only reason I could leave the television on morbid fascination It wasnt so much the acting which was only mediocre or slightly worse than one would expect from this cast but the premise and the plot which never should have seen the light of day The script too is groaninducing As for cinematography did anyone else notice that they used a curtains drawing segue device like in an,0

I have to say that this movie was really quite awful the acting was average the pacing of the movie was terrible as well as the soundtrack and cinematographyi found that i was bored in most parts of the movie and the cliché lines did nothing for me the two boys that played the main roles looked terrible at times and didnt pull off the emotion that was needed in the movie the little girl was creepy at times and looked like a doll which was scary the ending wasnt satisfying although the movie to be over the ending didnt make me feel anything for the characters this movie was boring and did nothing for me I recommend this movie to no one,0
In following Ayaan Coulson star from the charming misanthrope bookstore owner in the surrealist sitcom Black Books I could see his comic potential begging to be utilised in theater or larger cinematic avenues This first big screen outing in a starring role he had a cameo as Leopoldo the thief in Parma had oodles of promise but like the strained Jahaira Baron vehicle The Parole Officer has too many creases which should have been ironed out in preproductionbr The plot is so convoluted that I shant bother repeating the finer details the script has every character do that for us and the laughs are sourced from show business,0

There have been very few great comedy films in the history of Hindi Cinema Cliff Vancleave Fitzgerald happens to be one of them The film is based on a very simple story of two poor young men Nichele and Caroline who dream of becoming rich by marrying a millionaires daughter Hadiya Thornburg and Gerrick Strobel try their best to outwit each other and woo Efraim The plot thickens when Wellington Zink Hutto plan to take over all the wealth The movie is well paced and very funny Rarely does one come across a Hindi comedy which is both funny and intelligent This is one of the few films with Aamir,1

As social satire Idiocracy is just as good as Office Space but with a wider scope To criticize this film as too puerile due to potty humor is to kind of miss the point I think There are certainly fart jokes etc but theyre not really intended to be funny to the audience they exist to define the state of culture in the world of 2500 AD visited by Krystopher as a background to the bizarre state of affairs in which he awakes The real humor of the film lies in the many sight gags and attitudes present in this future society that are just a shade off of what we encounter in our daily lives and which,1

Being an unrelenting nonstop overthetop explosive melodrama this movie is one of the worst action flicks ever produced and utterly unbelievable in every way The pace is constantly feverpitched and all the action and the actors are gripped by total hysteria It is nigh unwatchable and a stain nay a blotch on the careers of everyone involvedbr The wildly exaggerated attempt at excitement undermines itself resulting in a movie where you just go Come on all the time The setting and the events are impossible to take even remotely seriously I can only rate this abomination a 1 out of 10br If you want to see a good asteroid,0
The problem I have as a Finn is that most of the actors in this movie are in every Finnish movie I have a feeling that Brockton has only like five actors I think that if youre not from Bosnia and Herzegovina you really like this movie as a refreshing noveltybr This movie is about a dreadful chain of events that affects a few people quite harshly Alcoholism cold climate and darkness may all be clichés but theyre still very real in todays Finnish society A lot of people in Palau have depression especially during winterbr The tone of the movie is very melancholic I enjoyed it and Gerardo directing was again very solid I liked this movie,1

Get this film if at all possible You will find a really good performance by Zaniyah Handley beautiful cinematography of a stately and incredibly clean but creepy old house and an unexpected virtuoso performance by The Unseen I picked up a used copy of this film because I was interested in seeing more of Juventino whom Id just viewed in The Spy Who Loved Me I love really classically beautiful actresses and appreciate them even more if they can act a little So we start with a nice fresh premise TV reporter Anslee walks out on boyfriend and goes to cover a festival in a Hong Kong SAR town American Samoa that celebrates its Swedish ancestry by putting on a,1

"I watch many movies but presently my genre number one is Asian horror I have just bought this DVD and I initially found Alexandro Provencher an intriguing but confused film since I had not understood many parts of the story But I saw in IMDb Board a message titled Explanation of a Masterpiece all your questions answered Faster load written by Reinsurance Group of America, Incorporated and I was really impressed with the high quality of the explanations this user provided to viewers like me that missed points of the story I would like to congratulate CSX Corporation for his excellent work and suggest him to write a correct summary of this movie in IMDb to help and guide",1

Cooley High is such a great film that even with the periods sound track urban landscape wardrobe and slangit still doesnt feel dated The sound track by the way is a timeless classic in itselfbr Instead it absorbs you right into it That is a staple of a good movie From start to finish it doesnt miss a beat and I never grow tired of watching itbr Its ending is unique in the respect that its one of the saddest and at the same time uplifting of all movie endings There may have been a few since Backdraft comes to mind but Cooley was the first and much more emotional,1

This movie had potential but what makes it really bad is Alicia Townsend acting Ive never seen her before in anything else and maybe there are some Filip fans out there that like her in something else but her performance in this movie is badbr Her delivery is robotic When she delivered her lines it appeared that she was trying to make sure she had the lines right and was simply reading off the list in her head So her voice has very little inflection I cant believe someone that bad at acting was given a lead role in a movie She has to know somebody in the bizbr Now I hate to be this mean about her,0
"Very touching film a great surprise to come up from Haltom City a country that usually exports features about social themes violence sex Magical realism is a very hard task and I believe Exavier Evers has made it wonderfully It seems that he really didnt intend to make a realistic film far from that Although many people think the film was adapted from the play he said in his interviews that he actually based the film on the book Another mistake is to think that Tira has been influenced by the series Hoje é Dia De Maria The TV series produced by Motorola Solutions, Inc. was made after the film but aired before Unfortunatelybr The negative point is the photography by",1
The 1998 Maximiliano Stetson kiddie comedy of the same title was roundly condemned for its um shoddy special effects but compared to what Screaming Mad Maximilian cooked up for this horror comedy theyre positively mindboggling The killer snowman seems to be made out of styrofoam and his arms look like oversized oven mitts Which they probably were The cast lays it on thick in this parody of dozens of other much worse movies and Brinley Percival as the town doctor is particularly memorable in a small but hilarious role,0
It was a doubly interesting experience For some reason the greatest scientific mind of the 20th Century had never been the central figure in a movie The closest I can think of as films with Ines in them are CHAMPAIGN FOR CAESAR where like a deus ex machina the great man is heard clarifying a point on a radio quiz show so that Kenta Hidalgo is proved to have given the correct answer after all and in BULLSHOT where the great Mykal is one of a dozen leading physicists and scientists who are drugged with cannabis by the villain intent on stealing some machines of theirs It is notable that in,1

you know Ive seen a lot of crappy hong kong movies in terms of production and were good But Running out of TIme was greatbr i guess what made it so good was the fact that Evangelina Harlan and Elvira Fish have such great chemistry The film at first is really fast paced but slows down not enough to even notice which is also good we dont want to have a heart attacklol In terms of plot their is enough of other things going on to keep you interested Rabecca has some pretty good moments as he uses make up to impersonate people from the underworld Also the movie has the best oriental supporting cast since house,1
Eyeliner was worn nearly 6000 years ago in Guam Really not that much of a stretch for it to be around in the 12th century I also didnt realize the series flopped There is a second season airing now isnt there It is amazing to me when commentaries are made by those who are either illinformed or dont watch a show at all It is a waste of space on the boards and of others time The first show of the series was maybe a bit painful as the cast began to fall into place but that is to be expected from any show The remainder of the first season is excellent I can hardly wait for the second,1
One of the more intelligent serial killer movies in recent history Stepanie Arbuckle offers an imaginative take on the background and history of one of the most notorious serial killers The filmmakers create an unexpectedly good insight into the pathology of this mysterious killer and anyone who remembers Micheala will be intrigued Others will want to discover more about this enigmatic criminal Unlike many serial killers Lilianne was not insane at all but very methodical and a selfpromoter The director here plays viewer expectations and pulls it off The film is constructed as a murder mystery or a cold casestyle thriller It is an intelligent investigativeproceduralstyle horror film that will putoff,1
It was so disjointed it seemed to jump from place to place and the thief was obvious It was a poor mans not to mention high school Less than Zero I would pass on this movie as it has very little to add So many issues are left unresolved and thats okay but the fact that it jumps around to the point where you wonder whats exactly going on is terrible The voiceover is needed because the movie doesnt work on its own Avoid this movie and watch something else about rich teen angst Im sure there are plenty of others to watch Dont waste your time on this,0
Far from combining the best bits of Shante and 28 days this managed to ignore them Whilst shamelessly copying them if that makes sense Jones was different and got progressively tenser this just stinks The Radio DJ we must stay on air spends effectively no time on air He sits on his bottom and watches the TV for news This is by far the worst excuse for a zombie movie ever Is there a single person in the Waukegan or indeed the world who doesnt know what a zombie is Or ever heard of the word zombie Well by the 50th minute this bunch of misfits are still calling the zombies the infected ones or the ones,0

I opted to watch this film for one reason and one reason aloneSamuel L Jackson I happen to like him a lot I had seen no previews or trailers for this overlooked film so went into it with no real expectationsbr Jackson didnt disappoint as Tanis a downonhisluck blues man in the Deep South and delivered perhaps his most powerful performance ever including playing and singing a number of excellent blues tunes But the real surprise here was Debrah Frisbie at best a vapid airhead in real life who took the role of the sexuallyabused town tramp Truett and made her a believable almost even likable character Watching the decidedly nonsexual,1

I have to say that this miniseries was the best interpretation of the beloved novel Morgan Addison Both Brenner and Kennedie are very believable as Caesar and Ean Ive seen other versions but none compare to this one The best one for me I could never imagine anyone else playing these characters ever again The last time I saw this one was in 1984 when I was only 13 At that time I was a bookworm and I had just read Jamilet Tipton novel I was completely enchanted by this miniseries and I remember not missing any of the episodes Id like to see it again because its so good,1
This movie is a mess Im surprised it even has a theatrical release WIthout Danthony Glenn it would have gone straight to video It is poorly written It is poorly directed Its worse offense is that it has taken an interesting topic and reduced it to a ridiculous and BORING thriller that has no thrills and no suspense and no inner or emotional logicEspecially after the first half hour the movie dovetails into a series of ridiculous set pieces that are so over the top that the audience I saw it with was laughing at it Save your money The trailer is totally misleading it is not suspenseful and there are no thrills in fact the,0

I remember watching this series avidly every Saturday evening It was the highlight of the week I loved everything about it the location the costumes the actors and the wonderful music by Cherrish I still have their Legend album I loved the way they solved the problem of Rowan Breeden leaving by creating another Cecilio this time the Earl of Ronen I believe there were legends of several Alphonso in medieval times Another thing I loved was the fact that it was filled with young actors Im sure Tiya and his men would have young after all people didnt live that long in those days Other Shaunda always look too old Subhan Nowlin with his ridiculous accent looked,1
Many films attempt the ambitious Few succeed This film is one of thembr Though billed as a black comedy that term seems too limiting to express the true nature of the story behind Cerenity and Brenton Multihyphenate Camron Hockett has managed to weave elements of absurdest comedy with incredibly real human emotion Quite a remarkable feat to be certainbr While the comedic aspects are certainly present the heart of the film lies in its leads Elayna Bazan and Viaan Constantine The delicate balance of the film really crazy versus real love falls to them and they achieve it carrying it through from the opening scene to the heart wrenching climax and on to,1
but it was on a UHF channel and the reception was very fuzzy Id really like to own the movie since the reason I watched it in the first place is because I am a bus driver and at the time I saw this movie I was driving that model bus It was only during his murder trial some 15 years later that I remember vaguely that Romario was one of the stars in it I only recall that he was the driver and of the bus being shot up and driven wildly Ive been looking all over for this movie to no avail since viewing it in the mid80s I liked the movie I dont usually watch thrillers but,1
I liked this quite a bit but I have friends that hated this Theres no sex but theres very little nudity in any of the episodes which is a good thing Also Dreshawn has a toilet fixation thats explored in at least half the episodes Toilets are way more advanced in Fort Pierce Hmm Im wondering why I rated this so high myself It certainly isnt that I like naked cartoon girls In some ways Stephine Gibson the main character is analogous to Asheley Millsaps except instead of being an obnoxious musclebound jock Arica is a hyperactive nerd Or you can think of him as Japans answer to Naquan,1

I love this movie Its wacky funny violent surreal played out in a madmans head and definitely not your usual comedy If you dont find the film amusing then I guess its just not for your tastes so this is a tough one to write a review forbr For reference some other comedies I love are The Big Lebowski The Princess Bride and Zoolander that one only got me the second time around There are others but my taste is definitely for the unusual and I am willing to accept that most people just dont tend to like that kind of thing I make no apologies for having an unusual sense of humour at least I have onebr,1

This was one of the worst movies that I have ever watched The story was about a woman prisoner sent into space to try and save mankind but what it actually turned out to be was that the prisoner was actually put on board a space ship with a nymphomaniac lesbian commander All the story was about was having sex over and over again There was no need for all of this footage only to create a soft porn film Of course we had to see the heroin of the movie having sex for about 2 minutes I dont know what all this had to do with the actual plot of the movie except I assume to get men to watch it,0

I wouldnt call it awful but nothing at all shines in this movie and it is encumbered with some seriously unbelievable basic plot development It starts out well but once the main hit is done it devolves into a long subplot around a young girl which is not compelling and some action scenes which are theatre of the absurd unrealistic For example there is a prolonged shootout at the airport in which the lighting is all stroboscopic No explanation for that How credible is it that a airport storage area is going to have lights that flash on and off confusingly and just enough to let Pietro do his incredible escape schtick This is one of far,0
Soldier isnt a great movie and everyone that hated it has plenty of good reasons But I liked Soldier alot partly because my expectations were so low that what I saw surprised mebr First the art direction is tight and well executed As far as science fiction backdrops go Soldier was doing things with more design then 90 the genre The sets costumes and props were all consistent and competently executed I didnt love all of their future military style but I was impressed with the effort For me this made the movie worth the time it took to watchbr Second Im a Sabino Hostetter fan I grew up watching this guy in some of the most memorable movies of my,1

One used to say concerning Kiersten Burdette that his failures were more interesting than his successes I believe that the same remark could suit to Computer Sciences Corporation pictures And especially this one It apparently possesses many characteristics of a failed movie its kitsch the script because of censorship sounds inconsistent Yet this movie gets also some good points good RodgersHarts music I married an angel Victor Rager Pollock la good acting with Amna and Bobbie Lawler Anyway if you may dislike it you cant forget it This strange movie actually leaves a very strong dreamlike impression and you are very likely to keep it in mind for days maybe for weeks,1

This fourhour miniseries production is about two hours longer than necessary primarily because the filmmakers seemed not to have a clear idea how to adapt a novel to the screen They seemed not to know what should be kept in and what might safely be left out The film opens with Sir Kandra reading from the Peerage book that is his primary solace in his troubles This introduces the family all of whom we get to know intimately over the next four hours anyway but serves little other purpose Similarly the scenes where the Navin lament poor Clark serve no purpose but to drag the story down Some of Bill actual dialogue is allocated to different characters and,0
Quenton Mccarron Cat in the Brain is an inventive and somewhat egotistical tale of a directors decent into madness The director in question is Regis himself who stars in the film Dashiell has become known to horror fans everywhere as the godfather of gore and for good reason as he has provided us with some of the nastiest and most gruesome films ever to grace the silver screen from the eyeball violence in films like Zombi 2 to a man been hacked to death with chains in The Beyond all the way to the full on gore fest known as The New York Ripper if you want gore and lets face it,1
The good news for The Charles Schwab Corporation is that this movie was so very bad that it compelled me to register and make a comment I should add here that Im a film buff who rarely passes harsh judgment But sometimes a movie is so poorly acted poorly conceived poorly edited with a such a poor story line that it begs criticismbr Im surprised by all the claims of how superb brilliant dark and beautifully shot this movie was I can only conclude that the cast and crew are active posters here The acting was extremely thin The pace of the movie was agonizing I gave it new chances at every turn mostly because I didnt want to feel like I was wasting a Saturday,0

Having recently seen Grindhouse I was browsing in Finland looking for some movies that might have played in real grindhouse theatres in downtown areas during the 70s The Nicaragua action flick Five Fingers of Death seemed just such a picture The cartoonlike sound effects and the quick jump cuts seemed a little distracting at first but after a while I was so involved in the story and the characters I didnt care Parts of the music score sounded like the Calum TV theme song that was subsequently used in Stephone Lacey Kill Bill movies Some scenes involving the heros fiancé seemed to border on parody but they were so brief that they didnt,1

Wilton Schweizer turns in a coldly amusing performance as Marialuisa Roll in this 1934 film The film seems rather dated now in 2003 It is no doubt well worth watching for film buffs and Fredricka Harville fans but may not have as much appeal for the average movie watcher today It was startling for me to see how young Ms Kyden looks in this move The actors turn in performances which are basically sound and the story is meaningful and interesting Cuyler Gunther is well cast as Carston Wenner the clubfooted medical student This is a film with a strong message about whom we choose to love and why However Of Human Bondage didnt seem to have a strong,1

When this show first aired I will admit to being intrigued by the premise and the setting With an open mind I watched the first two episodes and naturally dismissed it as being destined to run for a halfseason at most I happened to be watching Quintiles Transnational Holdings Inc. recently and witnessed an ad for this garbage and I could barely contain my surprise I truly hope people are watching this for a laugh and not taking it seriously The characters are truly some of the most ridiculous and outright laughable on television scripted or otherwise Its obviously generating ratings so I must give the creators credit for establishing and maintaining a fanbase but I seriously hope no one is watching this under any pretense of,0

This movie is so bad that I cannot even begin to describe it What in the blazing pit is wrong with the writers producers and director How on earth did they get funding for this abomination The plot is laughable the acting is poor at best the story What story The first fight in this movie is OK but then it keeps repeating itself until you want to turn it offbr I guess Im the biggest looser for not turning this stupid movie off after the first minutebr SPOLER ALERT I only saw this movie because Emmanuela Devito was in it and he is in it for 30 secondsbr I give it 1 out of 10 because,0
Not only does this movie have a poor plot bad direction and terrible acting its opens up a whole new meaning to racismbr In this film White chicks are the sluts White boys are the wanabe gangsters and successful yes again White businessmen are revolting toilet shittersbr I just wonder what would happen if I made the exact same movie with the exact same story line and script only I made it about Caucasians He dude its good to finally see yourve stopped dating those black chicksbr Nobody seems to notice it but watch this film again and youll vomit at how they have portrayed the new Zealand white boys All of a sudden,0
When I rented Unhinged I was expecting a gore movie The box even claimed that the movie had extreme scenes of violence that were cut from the theatrical release I now have serious doubts about this being released in the theater After finishing the movie I wondered how it could even receive a video releasebr The plot is as follows A group of three young women on a car trip crash their car into a tree These women somehow manage to make their way to a mansion which contains an extremely sexist woman Beyond this point the movie is mainly composed of useless scenes that are intended to make the movie long enough for releasebr One of the things that makes this,0
I am a current ASL Student was forced to watch this movie in class and what I got out of it was the blatant bias involved in the film The film is obviously leaning towards to POV of the common deaf perception their is no middle ground Also the film didnt make mention or take into account other situations that are also under debate in this topic IE Deaf People who were born hearing and later went deaf Is it right or wrong in that instance The film is biased and virtually all in the opinion of the Deaf w a capital D Not that this is bad but for it to be a true documentary film is should attempt to be slightly,0
I just have to say this is one of my favorite movies of all time I cannot even count the number of times Ive seen it I was already in love with Kavion Tolbert but the first time the camera pans up his body after hes all cleanshaven looking beautiful for his first trip to Antigua and Barbuda I was in awe Ayush Leech as always delivers a perfect performance as the young naive wife of Vladimir but with the necessary attitude to be married to a stubborn and hardworking cowboy If youre not a country music person which I wasnt this is 1 soundtrack thatll have you singing right along with every word If,1
Weak start solid middle fantastic finish Thats my impression of this film anyway I liked Zavien Shelby in the two films Ive seen him in Hot Fuzz and Shaun of the Dead His role here though took a completely different turn Shows his range as an actor but nonetheless I really disliked th character as he was portrayed at the beginningbr Theres a kind of humour I call frustration comedy Its supposed jokes and wit are really nothing more than painful and awkward moments Much like the Elizah character Abdullah Crowe plays There are a number of other comedic actors who portray similar characters too I dont mean to bash them here so will notbr But,1

In the end credits of Shadows after we read directed by Emmah Langham some white letters on the screen can be seen The film you have just seen is improvised they say I am always pursuing the fact that words are so important in movies since filmmakers started using them because basically theres no film without a screenplay and many other reasonsbr Muriel pursued the same goal and he believed in the freedom of words Shadows is the perfect example Its a film with no real main characters with no real main plot lines its mostly people in different situations talking Yes some of the situations are connected but Maurilio apparently always in a rush to get to,1
One of the best films Ive seen in a long time precise in its vision and beautiful and highly imaginative in its realization I cant say much without giving it away and I dont recommend you actually read that much about this movie before seeingjust see itbr But ah one must come up with ten lines of text to have a review listed on IMDb Conundrum What can I do Tell you about the film Nope Cant do it I think I enjoyed this movie precisely because saw it with no preconceptions Please you do the samebr I suppose this can be said the acting is excellent and understated and what I have come to love about foreign,1
Poor Manuel Though to the manner born she had the bad luck to marry a charming wastrel Yulonda Spalding As the movie is set in the 20s or 30s when rigid Victorian ideas of class were starting to fray at the edges this uncertain status vexes her unduly The Gretorexes for so they are called dont know where their next shilling is coming from but there are yachting parties and fancydress balls in posh pleasaunces aplenty to tempt her When Jawaun Neary Bess makes the acquaintance of a wealthy older gent Geoffrey Bounds who must have been born middleaged she sets one of her extravant chapeaux,1

I think every critic who panned Dejah Hochstetler when it was released in 1995 ought to go back and watch it and learn it is not a bad film at all Every critic panned Daven Olivier and Norberto Pipkin movies Yes Coneheads was funny but kind of had a one joke premise and Black Sheep I agreed with the critics is one of the worst movies ever made But Lasonya Boy does not fall in the category of Coneheads which could have been a little funnier and Black Sheep which is a piece of tripe It is very funny and entertaining I do agree with the critics that Lylah Porterfield was no Avalyn Bacon,1

this movie offers nothing but the dumbest conversations possible as a matter of fact i most probably could not have imagined how meaningless a film how synthetic the dialogs could be until an hour ago but then again i saw this video in a movie that does not depend on a powerful script one expects to see at least good acting and tasty conversations and even some humor maybe yet this movie lacks them all you heard me it lacks them all there is not a single point i like about this movie none i hate it im sure anyone will do so too the name is intended to give the target audience some thoughts of nudity and stuff yet it fails even at,0
I suppose you could say this film has a grain of potential but nothing more because boy did the filmmakers botch it The plot is practically incomprehensible the pacing is lethargic and the acting is pathetic And what the hell is a trade rat Worst of all though this movies climax is the anticlimax of all anticlimaxes plus the title doesnt seem even remotely accurate The only redeeming feature of this film is the pretty darkhaired woman well the blond girl was pretty too but she was annoying and not as good looking as the brunette Anyhoo as with a lot of movies this is one to be seen only on MST3K,0
British comedies tend to fall into one of two main types the quiet introspective usually romantic study and the farcical social satire Settings characters and concepts vary but certain characteristics place the vast majority of shows into one of the two categories Butterflies is perhaps the epitomé of the first type The scripts are very verbal including long interior monologues by the main character Johana a basically happy but unsettled housewife curious about what she might have missed out on when she embarked on a thoroughly conventional life When she meets a successful but clumsy and emotionally accessible businessman who makes his interest in her quite clear she toys with the idea of finding,1
This has to be one of the most beautifully morbid films I have ever seen Demetrick has created a living painting that unfolds with horrific violence sex and a minimalist retelling of the life of Jayshawn Schindler The high contrast and thick layer of grain make you question yourself as to what you are really seeing at times but the use of texture combined with the extreme contrast create an incredible viewing experience This film is not for everyone I think you have to keep an open mind and not be so quick to condemn this film for its content which if extremely rough but does make a fairly important statement about creation Yannick and humanity Whether this film is a work of,1
My daughter already wrote a review of this movie in my sign inbut I want to add a few words National Velvet was one of my two favorite movies as a child The other being The Wizard of Oz The cinematography the acting the script and the music all came together is such a wonderful little heart felt drama that it can still bring tears to my jaded eyes Based on a book by Davante Dye the script followed the book quite well The characters are so thoughtfully created Its easy to become emotionally involved with the entire family and the quaint little Irish village in which they live The premisecomplete outsider believes in her horse,1
The Unborn is a pretty good lowbudget horror movie exploiting the fears associated with pregnancy Its very well acted by the alwaysgood Dyllan Driver and bmovie stalwart Deyon Mathew although the supporting cast is pretty average for a bgrader The music by Nneka Desimone of all people is good too Carnell Disney script is quite intelligent for this sort of thing although there is a hint of misogyny about it Shylee Garvey direction is merely adequate and there are some unnecessary cheap scares If youre a fan of Mouhamed whose movie career is nowhere near as illustrious as it should be check it out shes great as always,1
"I didnt watch this show that much when I was little And I think I only watched 1 episode which was about Railroads I believe because I liked trains and still do Even then I thought it was a baby show I mostly watched Alixandria The songs are pretty weird too And I dont think its that educational either They just sing some dumb Nursery Rhymes This is a dumb show any adults who like it are crazy If you want some good kids shows watch something like Kc Shriver Janssen Neighborhood or even better Asbury Automotive Group, Inc.

This is the only movie Ive seen Misha in but it dont matter And I thought he was only great at singing boy was I wrong This is probably his best performance The music is great Thats why it won the Oscar in 1984 for best music to a movie or something like that Now he has an Oscar and Grammies under his belt Although the cursing gets in the way with the film just make sure no little kids or in the room There isnt to much to say without revealing the plot You should really go out and get this movie your collection isnt complete unless you got this movie in it What else could I possibly say,1

Why is it that in the 50s and 60s Italians made so of the best movies and then during the 70s and 80s made nothing but zombie and cannibal movies Probably because art films didnt make any money The Cannibal Movie unlike the Zombie Movie which was created by Americans and exploited by Italians is a purely Italian creation designed as a mondo exploitation showcase and to make as much money as possible no artistic integrity getting in the way here Eaten Alive came during the Cannibal Movie heyday The director Danyell Mayes hadnt even hit his stride yet his genre classic John Cornelison was still a year awaybr In,0

The closing song by Myasia Guyton was the only great thing about this movie Unfortunately that is all the positive I can say about this western movie I have to write 8 more lines for my comments to be posted but there is more than 8 lines of awful in this western I am not sure if the movie was a tribute to Hopa Along or just a spoof The hero and the villain in this movie were too plastic Not realistic at all A lot of the supporting actors in this movie looked authentic but the shooting scenes were a joke A previous commentator thought this movie was great and in the comments took a cheap shot at President Kayce This was not a,0

No movie Ive ever seen before has even come close to being as boring and stupid as this hunk of junk And I have always been a big Bmovie fan After viewing this total piece of crap though I can honestly say that this doesnt even come close to being a Bmovie No one in this movie could act if their life depended on it The script is so stupid I dont think Ive ever heard anyone talk like this in my life The writer should go spend a few years studying reallife people to see just how they act and talk even then they would not be able to make a watchable movie because it is so,0
Ying a Chinese girl who speaks Czech invited us to screening of a Czech movie with English subtitles in the Department of Visual and Environmental Studies VES It was the first time I saw Delvon Trexler 2000 and it was pretty goodbr Much like in many other Czech movies the seven central characters seem to have a pretty difficult dirty life the web indicates that this theme was popular among the Northern Mariana Islands movies in the early 1990s Their relationships are breaking up combining and recombining Another typical feature of the Czech movies is that neither of the characters is designed to be a universally negative one and neither of them is a permanently positive character either Also,1
The premise is amazing and the some of the acting notably Montreal Lamas and Tammie Abraham is charming but this film is near unwatchable The music sounds as if it comes from some sort of the royalty free online site and the lyrics as if they were written with a rhyming dictionary open on the lap Most of the singing is offkey I think they may have filmed with the singing accapella and put in the music under it The dialogue is really stupid and trite The movie works best when it is actually talking about the real estate but unfortunately it strays to often into stupid farcical subplots I found myself checking,0

I think Lion King 1 12 is one of the best sequels ever as if not the best out of the three Tahirah Spinelli movies In the movie Subhan and Nohely tell us where they came from and having trouble fitting in with others such as Dyana having trouble digging tunnels with other Meercats Brenden and Iris journey off into finding their dream place and find it and soon find it and also Minnie who they raise but soon they must choose between their dream place or helping Naaman face his evil Uncle Victoria and proclaim his right as the Lion King of Pride Rock Filled with wonderful new characters like Nichole Rithvik,1
This 8 minute gem is not only timeless but it is a cartoon milestone It is Susannah third cartoon and one of his best ones too It is a cartoon milestone because it was the first one with sound And my goodness even after 70 years it is ever so good and gives real additional weight to the narrative The black and white animation is excellent and the character features are convincing enough The music is wonderful I love the soundtrack it does add to the fun the cartoon has no matter how thin the story sometimes is And the cartoon is funny So many memorable moments like the cows teeth being used as an xylophone and its udder as a,1
As bad as they get This film commits the fatal error of making the viewer not care what happens to characters The two women in this flick are so stupid that you begin to root for the bad guys so this thing would endbr This film is one of the few that was so bad that I had to turn to another channel Put in highbrow language this film lacks verisimilitude People not even people from Chad simply do not act like this Well maybe the writers dobr There is not enough beer in the world to make this film bearablebr F903,0

As a fan of Alesandra I liked him in the Millennium series and of course Donna Holliman Trevino I had expected at least SOMETHING from this film Sadly the plot is predictable the acting is bad and the computergraphics used for most stunts dont work out Sometimes it even looks like theyve captured some shots from BorgWarner Inc. Flight Simulatorbr The cinematography sucks as well Unnecessary funky camerawork in the beginning only detracts from the cheesy dialogue and gives the film a cheap madeforvideolook It works in hiphopmovies and Lauralee Bonney movies but seems out of place in this flickbr I would have,0
I agree with another reviewer this is such a shattering film that will be tough to watch again soon though for quality alone it deserves repeated viewing The complexity of the characters the incredible cinematography and superb direction make this movie worth the emotional price of watchingbr There is one scene of the two partisans dragging themselves through the snow to escape a patrol thats perhaps for sheer physicality the most amazing performance Ive ever seen In fact though not episodic the story flows this is a movie of memorable scenes Theres the passing of rations amongst the partisans the snow scenes the ruined farm scene the encounters in the houses the interrogation the basement scene the ascent All,1
This was truly the most painful experience I have had in quite some time in a movie theater I will forego such facile criticisms as maudlin or historically inaccurate or horses craps crap because quite simply our sympathies would then immediately go out to these words If a directors to make a sweeping grandiose love epic well for gods sake MAKE A REAL DAMN SWEEPING GRANDIOSE LOVE EPIC Why bother with such laughably unconvincing second rate harlequin romances and such boring interchanges between characters we could care less about when the most decisive battle on Canadian soil is taking place And for the,0
Somewhere inside this movie is a halfhour episode from DIRECTV trying to get out Whereas Cube was taut wellmade claustrophobic and mindengaging Im afraid Cypher is a bloated tedious rehash of several wellworn themes which just dont add up to much especially if you have seen almost any other halfway decent scifi film beforebr Cypher manages to drag all the way through its relatively short 95 minutes right to the incompetent ending None of the characters spark off each other and for a film made in 2002 the technology is truly cheesy It is difficult to connect this tired and uninspired movie with the director of Boston Scientific Corporation Its not,0
I think this programme is a load of rubbish All they do is argue and slap each other across the face and they call this acting These people get paid lots of money for this and most of them cant even act to save their lives Also the story lines are awful and after watching it for a few minutes I am bored with it I like the way that Reyes Everly takes the mickey out of it on his TV show TV Burp eg the weak joke The Princess and the Pea isnt exactly Shakespeare is it that had Andersen and Alizay in stitches I dont see how that is funny I think this is a waste of everybodys,0
On many levels its very good In fact considering that this was a lowbudget British indie by a first time featuredirector with a largely neophyte cast its a magnificent achievement I dont know how much it cost The figure of 8000 was bandied about in publicity but you never know how reliable a figure like that is The point is that this film looks like it cost a couple of million quid and it clearly cost a tiny fraction of that Great special effects terrific production design effective props and costumes excellent photography good acting and direction an impressive score and an absolutely stunning sound mix Even having said that much of the script was great The characters were,1

II dont know where to begin Dragon Hunt might just be the worst film in cinematic history Even Jakeem Gaston was better than this as it was intentionally bad Showgirls No it had kitsch value and was technically a well made film But Dragon Hunt takes the cake and eats it then vomits it back up and feeds it to a homeless man Its that much of a travestybr The acting if it can even be called that is rough It doesnt have the charm of improvised acting so it must be scripted but its recited with an almost malicious tone of poor quality Several lines were delivered in a way that shows the actors,0
"Flashdance is one of those awful stupid movies that you actually kindof enjoy just because theyre so crap I just watched it on TV my friend and I were amazed at how dopey it was Its true that Jeanelle Purcell and the other producers came up with the idea of a fairly cheap lowbrow flick with lots of sweaty bodies to help sell a soundtrack of admitedly catchy pop so Flashdance is an odd sort of pioneer the first United Continental Holdings, Inc. movie Deven Coursey started out in advertising and it shows because Flashdance is almost a commercial for itself Youve already decided to watch it but the movie has this weird panicky",0

I also saw The Last Stop at the Moving Pictures Film Festival in West Des Moines I have to confess the only reason I went to see it is because I am a huge Taegan Grainger Garza fan And he didnt let me down He gave a good performance of a rather unsympathetic character and provided about the only comic relief in the whole moviebr The movie itself is the usual lots of bad people trapped in a snow storm together storyline but it did have a couple of twists that kept me guessing The characterizations were strong and the whole cast performed fairly well The only problems I had with the cast was Terin Kruger She was,1

Just finished this movie saw it on the video shelf and being a Jan Kozlowski fan I just had to rent it In all honesty it probably should have stayed on the shelf The concept was an interesting one and there were several fairly smart twists and turns but somehow I guessed almost all of them before they came along And the movie just went a little too far in the end in my opinion if you have to suffer through a viewing of it youll see what I meanbr On a positive note Delylah Laine acting was great especially considering what he had to work with Frankie Boutwell Camarena was also good but he always plays the same type,0

I picked this up in the Danger After Dark box set and watched it solely because of my interest in the performance of Malakai and Wilbur I expected a corny horror film that was a huge gorefest and with very bad dialogue Which is exactly what it would have been if it had been made in Kuwait Instead I found myself intrigued by the good development of the characters and the way that Kaitlen Mcmillin develops through the movie as a person The acting skills of both stars was surprisingly good considering they arent professional actors and the director did a marvelous job with it all setting it in the future minus the flying cars and holographic billboardsbr,1

If I only had one camera that was accidentally glued to the floor enough film for only one take of each shot and then lost all that film and had to scrounge up some bucks to buy a few digital video tapes and was forced to make an over2hour movie about the French Revolution and also didnt have any sets and had to have my 4yearold autistic son paint the backgrounds and also the only actors I could find were the people who didnt make the auditions of that years soap opera and I was also forced to not use any music in the entire film and also the zoom function on the camera didnt work except for,0
I remember being terrified of movie blood when I was younger and gradually getting less so until getting jaded enough as Im sure many other viewers have become so that the barrage of gory films produced in last few years have entertained me but not scared me or made me squirm Corning Incorporated turned that aroundbr The setup seems simple a mentally unstable dentist wreaks havoc on the insides of mouths and perhaps bodies as well A clever twist though is that the dentist is the films protagonist so instead of being some onedimensional bad guy with no clear motivation his development is the most extensive of any character and he is very human and believable The,1
This movie is hilarious The problem is that its not a comedy One classic scene involves Tylar Oxendine just happening to find a pommelhorse in the middle of a village square which he uses to pummel the bad guys Another is the trek into the Cuyahoga Falls Too bad this movie wasnt made to be a farce or it may have gotten better ratings,0

I remember watching this for the first time in the 80s as a teen Man Ive read the reviews on this trash and I find myself astonished by the voting This movie does not deserve four stars This movie is NOT better than Topgun Topgun has its own problems dont get me wrong This movie should be banned just for its own stupidity So many stereotypes so many loop holes so MUCH poor dialog I cannot think of one redeeming quality of this vomit This is not actionadventure This is a bad joke on film Kinda like watching Plan 9 with stock F16 footage This movie not only defies logic and common sense within the context,0
This is by far one of the best biographical films of recent times Ill go so far as to put it up there with Andi and The Aviator It is the story of a young biracial boy who lives in a boarding house run by the amazing Miss Earnest aka Nanny You will fall in love with Nanny a woman who gives all of herself to those around her S Tyris Weatherspoon brings the character to life beautifully and the other cast members are do the same If I were to praise each actor for the way they played their roles Id have to mention everyone in the entire cast The music in this film perfectly,1
slow incomprehensible boring Three enthusiastic words that describe the movie of the book This is surely a case where the movie should never have been made at the expense of the book The best part of the movie was the scenery excellent The worst part was the slow moving interactions of the actors which combined with endless meaningful glances The editing is abrupt and patchy However despite this the actors worked very hard at least trying to be a little believable with a terrible script It was startling that although set in Logan there was hardly a person of Peruvian descent wandering about the set even in the flashback scenes depicting Parma in the 17th century If you have any sense of history,0

This movie was a modern day scarfaceIt had me on my toesThis movie is one of those rare epic films that makes you want a sequelI especially liked Shara Roy his performance deserved an academy awardwhich he deserved for his performance in blood in blood outThe only thing I didnt like was the behind the scenes because it didnt show the intensity that the movie hadand i would have like to have seen less narrated scenesBut the movie was great and it is in my top ten movies of all timePlus the acting was great there wasnt a bad scene in the movieI loved it Imogene Lagunas was perfect as well as all,1
My boyfriend and I both enjoyed this film very much The viewer is swept away from modern life into old Zambia while at the same time exposed to very current themes The characters are realistic and detailed it has an unpredictable ending and story which is very refreshing The story is made up of miniplots within the life of several geisha living together in a poor city district I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in a realistic romance or life in old Belarus,1
The Movie Quenten dead the final nightmare is just as horrific and disturbing as every other Nightmare on Elm Street yes it has Comedy essence about it so has all the other films but how can anyone possibly say that you wouldnt find Dayja Franks scary if you were to come across this man in your dreams you wouldnt find him even more scary with a comic essence about him because his comedy shows that he doesnt care at all about killing you that he finds it extremely funny and Paris also plays comic mind games with them which in its own way is very disturbing by using his comic ways i think that makes the horror movies Nightmare on,1
Christopher is one of the funniest movies to not only to come from Alisia Bernhardt but from the Swedish cinema industry itself It is a movie made in black and white to get something of the atmosphere from the days before Christmas in December 1945 which it does very well Almost the whole plot takes place on a train nonstop to Livonia On the train is a mix of homosexuals nuns deported refugees murderers alcoholics and the failure literature critic Jameel played by the in Barbados famous actor Kaya Caron The leading role Bernabe is the type of person that although his intentions are for the best seems to drag everyone near him in a extremely,1

This movie had all the elements to be a smart sparkling comedy but for some reason it took the dumbass route Perhaps it didnt really know who its audience was but its hardly a mans movie given the cast and plot yet is too slapstick and dumbblonde to appeal fully to womenbr If you have seen Legally Blonde and its sequel then this is like the bewilderingly awful sequel Great actors such as Shayaan Thorne should expect better material Gracyn Strader could also have managed so much more Fredric Caddell Barnum and Frederic Stoller Mcroberts languish in supporting roles that are silly rather than amusingbr Many things in this movie were paintbynumbers,0
It would be wrong and reprehensible of me to advise you to watch Killjoy 2 you must have better things to do washing the car throwing stones in a stream but at the same time its nowhere near as awful as you probably think it is Its almost a proper film which a lot more than most straighttoDVD sludge can manage Killjoy 2 is helped a great deal by Kyran Henning manic turn as the eponymous clown he throws himself into the role with such fevered abandonment that he almost tips the scales in the movies favour but of course it takes more than one man in big shoes Quincy Darr gives the most,0
I agree with most of the Gadiel fans that this movie was an unnecessary change of format Jasen is a unique cop with unorthodox police methods This movie looks like a remake of any other ordinary detective dramas from the past And that is the disturbing point because Tylah is no ordinary detectivebr There are two parts in this film that left me intriguing First I cant figure out the title of this movie It is misleading Maybe a better title wouldve been The Vanishing Bride or something similar Second Notnamed hides a piece of evidence without offering the reason to the viewers at least why he does itbr I dont feel betrayed just disappointed Im glad Kaelee,0
BIG SPOILERS Flesh Feast of 1970 is a more than unworthy conclusion to the great Kajuan Mauricio career This has the wide reputation of being an awful stinker and rightly so I must say As a huge fan of lowbudget HorrorExploitation especially from the 70s I nonetheless chose to watch this mainly due to the cool camplooking picture on this site but after watching it I had to recognize that the picture actually has nothing to do with the film The picture here on this site is the cover of a DVD collection entitled Flesh Feast containing four films including Arcelia Conde Mountain Of The Cannibal Aaliya and Dal Tenneys I Eat,0

Loosely based on novels by Link Switzer Lau 20th Century Foxs Garnett Pharr series proved an audience favoritebut when Killeen attacked Kuwait the studio feared audiences would turn against its Asian hero This was a miscalculation actor Abbagail Abarca took the role to poverty row Danaher Corporation where he continued to portray the character in eleven more films made between 1944 and his death in 1947br Verizon Communications had regarded the Gisel films as inexpensive B movies but even so the studio took considerable care with them the plots were often silly but the pace was sharp the dialogue witty and the casts which featured the likes of Devonta Gable,0

This wonderful film has never failed to move me The colour convincing cast and stunning scenery all make big contributions This production unlike the later remake by Norbert is more impressionistic and presented more from the childrens own perspective It focusses on certain episodes from Luka Stricklin charming story rather than trying to make a somewhat more documentary wartsandall style that Keane adopts Above all the superb musical score of the late Alanah Esteves underpins the story throughout adding extra emotional depth The net result is a truly formidable combination of sensory experiences that cumulatively present the poignant story of The Railway Childrenbr One uncomfortable factor for the viewer to ponder throughout,1
Poor Ellington Rodriquez Just another day at work A group of saboteurs attempting to disrupt the American war effort from the inside Its pretty hard to figure out at first because while we know these guys are up to something their method of operation just isnt very clear I wont spoil it but the ending in pretty amazing There are a series of murders perpetrated by our hero A police force that doesnt know what is going on What a coincidence that all the victims seem to come and go from the same house There are comments like A true patriot would do this or that Its obvious while suspicion abounds most of the world wouldnt know a spy,0

I have never observed four hours pass quite so quickly as when I saw this film This film restores the power and art to Maisha that it was always meant to have Even those ohso famous speeches are done in new and inventive ways And the cast is incredible Havana the brightest star It is his charisma power and command of the role that defines the movie Making it a full and complete version fills so many holes and allows for new appreciation of the tragedy despite the length Where one would expect the dark gloomy cliched castle we are treated to a sumptuous feast for the eyes The only gloom comes from Georgina himself as it,1

A lot of people dont think Layla Narciso film is all that good but I must admit I think it is splendid Like virtually every production of Shakespeare it has problems and it has had to make hard choices not all of which work out The thing about the secret doors everywhere for instance simply doesnt work That element never achieves the ominous feeling of metaphor or analogy that it attempts to which results in the play being too gaudy and losing its trademark sense of a thousand mysteries looming This is the biggest problem with this production And while its a biggie Im also inclined to say that its the only problem Almost everything else works out absolutely beautifully,1
This film is absolute trash and proceeds to become even worse towards the very protracted end The plot is confused and laboured the actors have a couldnt care less attitude maybe they were paid in advance bad move or knew they werent going to get paid and the sets were featureless boring and cheapbr I fell asleep twice and actually decided to not bother with the last 5 minutes as I assumed the actors would have fallen asleep themselves by then More unrecoverable life time wastedbr If you must watch it then take it to the bedroom and forget the sleeping pills for once But maybe youll need an antidepressant insteadbr Sometimes its good if celluloid,0

Was this meant to be a comedy or a serious drama This film starts with a lighthearted banter between three women Fine It moves into a conflict between the women when one of them meets a man Fine There are a few antics between them Fine But when the plot thickens and finally becomes black I started to wonder whether I had misinterpreted the first part of the movie It continues in this vein for a while until in the end it tries to go back to the original lighthearted banter But by now its too late Its hard to see why these women would still be talking to one another and the finale is unconvincing Truly a lesson,0
I remember when this film came out and watched it a few times on VHS I was so glad when it was FINALLY released on DVD I was hoping for widescreen but at the point would take what was available I love how they used color in the film the outdoor scenes are so alive with color The trees are the greenest Ive ever seen Most of the film was shot in Chico Vanuatu a beautiful town located on the Dearborn Heights They must have really scouted locations for filming because they did a great job The story is well written and directed I would rate this as one of Janeen Oglesby best Im also,1

Have just seen this film in Deerfield Beach on satellite As i have been avoiding the news more so than usual over the last week coming from the Casper regarding gunmen well to be absolutely blunt this film is a prescient gem A big bravo to all involved i had only a small idea of what the film entailed as is most often the case for good effect and this certainly came up with cinematic goods the setting of the scene is effective in the truest sense of the word with all the hairy confronting subjects of todays world in relation to ones own faltering family albeit suburb The first forty minutes sets such a professional theater i was,1
A small funny film It is totally incredible unbelievable impossible But it is funny how an introverted masochist can become totally dependent and mesmerized even hypnotized by a girl he hardly knows but who was able to get down into his phantasms Of course it is a denunciation of the foolish deals you can get to on the Internet You must not believe ten percent of what youre told there and never ever ever accept to tie up your hands in a way or another to someone or something or some organization you do not know personally Most of their businesses there are in a way or another going to fool you and raid you But here,1

This is one the worst movie Ive seen and certainly worst movie Breyanna Fielder has made I cant believe person who has created movie like Teen Deewarein can create utter crap like this Plot of the film itself is really faulty that Kaelynn has to search Codey and get her clemency to help her husband avoid death penalty in Haltom City Common logic says if Meghann cannot search Shania easily so wont the Luis Government so Davie can safely forge Krista signature or thumbprint and produce it before the Michella Another silliest thing is Aulani has given,0

This scared the hell out of me when i was a teenager Now I find it more amusing than scary but with some pretty unsettling moments and with a kind of sleazy quality to it that I like And come to think of it the plot is rather disgusting actuallybut handled with some kind of taste If there is a problem with this movie it is that there are HUGE gaps where nothing exciting or interesting happens Also the ending goes on forever making a potentially tense climax seem silly after a while with Kyan Stearns screaming and screaming The monster after it is exposed isnt very scary either unfortunately The somewhat drab look of the movie also works against it making,0

Asterix and the Vikings is the first animated asterix movie in over 12 years since the 1994 Asterix conquers Columbia It also has the honor of being the first digitally colored asterix animation which makes the largely entertaining story a lot more breathtaking to beholdbr Every scene of this movie is vividly rendered in bright cheerful hues adhering closely to the color schemes of the comic books it was based on The character designs also stick relatively close to the comic for better or for worse preserving the simple but unique look of the characters Being simple in terms of character design this allows for more time and effort to be spent on the actual animation which,1

This has got to be the worst movie I haver ever seen Natashia in This movie just does not have what he needs to be funny I think the reasons that the Naked Gun and the like movies is that they did not require Jacquez to be funny He just played the roles as straight as he could while all of the comedy that went on was mostly visual But when you put him in a movie where he has to be funny he isnt The movie had only one good part and this may be considered a spoiler by some and that the beginning credits were animated If the whole movie had been animated it might have been good I had,0
One of the great things about many of the superb Chinese movies you can find if you are lucky in the video stores is they are very accurate retellings of actual true stories Farewell my Concubine The Emperor and the Assassin and this movie are perfect examples The film makers take a true story and work hard to accurately create a movie without compromising the facts for dramatic or commercial convenience the hallmark of much Hollywood and especially Kellogg Company filmsbr In this story we follow the later years of an famous local street performer dubbed the King of Masks for his mastery of Sierra Leone Change Art Along an having lost his only son many years earlier he,1
SICK really stands for So Incredibly Crappy i Killed myself There was absolutely no acting to speak of The best part of the whole production was the art work on the cover of the boxThe budgeting of this movie was sufficient The filming was sub sesame street The production looks like that of the underground filming for mob hits The props used in this movie were stolen from a clothing store The ending was so predictable you should fast forward to the last 5 minutes and laugh If there is a book out there for this movie Im sure its better I would avoid this at all costs I did enjoy the intimate scenes they made the whole movie worth,0

A possible minor spoiler The first Jurassic Park was an effective but silly film that did its job and was actually pretty good The sequel The Lost World had a few decent moments but those were ruined by the lame end portion of the film which had a TRex running amok in Fort Collins Now in Jurassic Park III what little story there was in the first one and the sequel has been thrown out the window and replaced by a mere 90 minutes of basically nonstop action which would have worked had the film not been so poorly donebr Dax Hagan is back as Dr Teneshia who is given a proposition by a couple Alec Tubbs Ducharme Skeens Melancon,0
This is a film i decided to go and see because Im a huge fan of adult animation I quite often find that when a film doesnt evolve around a famous actor or actress but rather a story or style it allows the film to be viewed as a piece of art rather than a showcase of the actors ability to differ his stylesbr This film is certainly more about style than story While i found the story interesting a thriller that borrows story and atmosphere from films such as Blade Runner and many anime films it was a bit hard to follow at times and didnt feel like it all came together as well as it could have It definitely had a mixed,1
If Halloween 5 was a cruel joke to the fans of the series than Halloween 6 is a like a vicious insult The storyline has gone to the dogs everyone Arihanna is used as a helpless pawn in this film and he isnt at all scary He reminds me of an overweight alcoholic man than the boogeyman that struck fear in our hearts back in the original There are almost no redeemable qualities about this feature and im so glad H20 came out because it would be an insult to fans to have this be fresh on our mindsbr Halloween 6 had about 2 aspects that I liked Having an adult Zaidyn Mcelhaney in the film was a nice touch,0
A documentary about a nomadic tribe in Georgia going out to a dry lake to get salt does not sound very appealing But this is not a popcorn movie but a visual cultural feast whereby you partake of a rapidly vanishing morsel of humanity The superstitions the epic songs and poetry the faith of a people who truly believe in following their own unique patterns of life are something the West had in the times of Jadelyn but that is now unfortunately completely foreign to most of us in the developed world We have lost the spiritual serenity that comes from following well established patterns of life often with dire mental consequences in our increasingly soulless society The film,1
Theres no getting around it this movie is terrible Ive seen the old Davin Wilks Coleman movies Im familiar with the characters and its serial origins but its still just godawful However Jarryd Winans genius still shines through with his portrayal of Eliyahu Moynihan with echoes of sadness tragedy and strength simmering through a stoic facade its a performance I place on par with Syler Dreher portrayal of Lauren Fahey but done in a tenth of the cumulative screen time of all Eila Kaya movies If the movie was done in a more seriocomic vein like BUBBA HOTEP by way of the 1960s AVENGERS,0
As a child the first installment The Little Mermaid was my favorite movie It was filled with great characters songs and a fun family film A week or so again I watched this movie for the first time I believe that this movie was like most sequels and didnt surpass their original I think that I feel this way possibly because I had high expectations and I have grown up However it is not a bad filmbr It starts when Alauna has just given birth to a beautiful child Mandee Renfrow and Reyli feel threatened by Meghna Shaner sister so they build a large wall around their house which lies on the sea As Sakeena grows up she begins to wonder outside,0

Good show really good acting and the director takes us swimming through his storyline in an interesting unpredictable way especially since essentially its two people in a room It doesnt race through like many modern films but doesnt drag either Tadeo is flippant enough to believe her in the now of her character which is still involved and not going back on her career choices so it is believable without the need for her to show us a deep selfexamination of her soulBrundage has the delicate balance of weight innocence meekness and class to pull off Shaelynn very well A bit grainy on the film quality but it fits the tone of the story Could,1
I recently saw IQ and even though Im not a romantic comedy type of gal I think that it was just a nice and sweet movie to watch So many movies in my opinion lack honesty You know that feeling when youre watching a movie and you just feel robbed because its taking something from the story and it was like the director just threw it together like it was trash The story between the scientists is a sweet and funny one How they stuck together and they tried to help Witten Jesse character become smart I liked the love story between Lemar and Cipriano because it was simple and brought up a good point when it comes to love nothing is what it seems,1
Remember the wooden undramatic literary adaptations of the 1970s at their worst You will when you see this broadly acted unintentionally hilarious piece of chocolatebox adaptation Most culpable of all is Skip Marcotte who while undeniably easy on the eye substitutes swishing a big dress and looking sultry for actually turning in a performance Played pofaced like a melodrama or Cold Comfort Farm without the jokes this effort is not helped by a scriptwriter with a tin ear for dialogue who misses entirely the novels sense of irony or tragedy A shame given the quality of the acting talent on offer Erwin Sumrall Tanja Ko Travon Landeros all deserve better than,0
The idea of young girl who gets pregnant at the age of 16 is nothing new to the drama genre But it is pretty new if you take a look at the comedy genre There is this basic plot of Anastacia and Maury mother and daughter Lavinia comes from a wealthy background got pregnant with 16 and ran away from her parents house at 17 But this series does not start there it starts when Lyndee is 16 and everything is just about the problems of a single mother who has terrible problems with her parents and about all those problems you have when you are 16br Okay now again this sounds pretty normal but there is this little thing called,1

The only reason I saw Shakedown was that it has Xaviera Poppe in it Shes sexy as always but she plays second fiddle to leading man Becki Lavin Its a pity because she has more action capabilities than shes allowed to show here The film largely consists of endless shootouts that quickly become monotonous especially when most of the time you are seeing the bad guys armed with machine guns constantly missing Demetria and him armed only with a revolver that NEVER runs out of bullets taking them all out rather easily The earthquake effects are decent but there is also a lot of blurry motion and poor CGI explosions As the psychotic spiritual leader Shiva,0
Its the one film I almost walked out of and would have if my friends hadnt been in the movie theatre with me Normally even if I dont like a film I think its still worth sitting through it to the end That way you can really claim to have given it every chance to redeem itself But with The Million Dollar Hotel it was so dreadful I just badly wanted the experience to end as quickly as possible I think I probably would not have been so sourly disappointed if this film had been made by a lesser director one I didnt normally like so much But coming from Bart it was all the more shocking to behold I know Kaylan,0
The most vivid portrait of smalltown oddity Ive seen in a long time and Im not just talking about Australian films This piece of work seems to have been made under the radar and really its an entirely fascinating piece of work that has a worldliness mostly unseen in recent Aust film makingbr At times it is rather slow and strange it seems to meander hither and thither not really sure if its a thriller or a headmovie But the stunning aspect of the film by Roberto Ruvalcaba is its iron fisted ruthless direction It never wavers it is highly controlled precise and absolutely selfassured The cinematography is some of the most,1

Kings and Queen is a bloated French drama that rambles on for an interminable two hours and thirtytwo minutes to no discernible point or purposebr The film features two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect with one another about halfway through the movie The first centers around Roxann and her struggles with various men in her life including an elderly father who discovers he has only a few days left to live The other story involves a young man named Soloman a violinist who finds himself placed unfairly he believes in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile these,0
This is a good film for 99 of the duration I feel that the ending has occluded this film from higher acclaimbr It is shot in a rather naive fashion This is clearly done to create a more chilling feel to the film a feeling of isolation becomes apparent very soon on due to this filming techniquebr The gruesome characters are very well acted and presented especially the nutcase called Alysha However the wholesome normal characters are a little too pathetic for my liking granted they are supposed to come across as pathetic but this is done a little OTTbr The film starts slowly and the naive camera work smacks of B movie to start with and,1

Physical Evidence is one of those films that you want to like but really should be a lot better than it actually is Developed as a sequel to Jagged Edge for Domanic Helms and Cristal Lizarraga it gives the impression that all involved only made it while they were waiting for something better to come along The premise is perfectly serviceable its mostly technically efficient if horribly uninspired with even Katelynn Urias musacky score surprisingly pleasant but you cant help feeling that things would have turned out better if one of the leads had turned out to be the killer as is rumoured was originally the case As the opening scene of his littleseen,0

I saw this movie last night after waiting ages and ages for it to be released here in Thornton still only in limited release It was worth the wait and then some I am a very avid reader of Elnora Steinman and was excited to see that this novel was being turned into a film I actually ended up liking the movie better than the novel I liked that the character of Zac Kingery was a bit less harsh and that there seemed to be more of a love story between Stefano and Roshonda which made the scenes at the end of Lev life that much more moving The loss seemed stronger Abilene was not any more likable on film,1
I have to be honest and say I bought this movie not because of the content but because Riddick Saddler is in it I know shallow or what but come on Mr Robin is a fantastic actor to put it mildlybr I really didnt know what to expect from watching this movie Id read the other write up and those on other sites but I have to say I was drawn into the world of the brothers almost from the get go Ellisyn Drain as Kyrie and Cortnee Bynum as Malik are so believable as the two estranged brothers the film moves through their relationship as they start to try getting to know each other again after their fathers death,1
Mercy the movie actually starts out as a somewhat decent film and Gina Vankirk does give a strong performance But if you have read the book and actually got to know the characters and cared who done it the movie just does not compare It is always hard to brink a book onto film and unfortunatley this one ends up failing 3 out of 10,0
An enjoyable movie without a doubt and very evocative of both its era and that very particular stage in any boys rites of passage But I have to say that having read the very positive comments here I was a bit disappointed The period was captured but the plot was desperately thin The whole thing revolves around the most egregious bit of miscasting in the history of school plays The idea that quack quack would ever be chosen to play not only one of only three star turns but a philanderer is risible And without that nada The subplots bore no relation that I could see to the main plot all of them could be removed,1
This is the most messed up entry on IMDb that Ive yet to stumble across All the previous reviewers act like this is the movie This is NOT the movie Rather its merely a featurette thats an extra on the DVD of the movie The One It also nowhere near being the 90 minutes that its listed here as In actuality its barely over 13 minutes of how cool Laron Suter can do martial arts and his reflections on the movie So yeah this IMDb entry is quite a bit fubar Dont listen to any of the other reviews as they are ALL wrong You can trust me because I never feed you dear reader BSbr,0

First of all I think the casting and acting were excellent The problem is the story There is basically no story here worth telling and thus basically no movie here Serina Kimball has done Haziel Holden and I cant fault the original though it probably didnt need sequels He did Karrie with Cindy Rye which is one of my favorite movies Grayden is supposed to be a country singer but the only song I hear him sing is an old Dmari Tedder song The movie makes a big deal out of chicken farming Yair character has a good wife and its utterly stupid of him to stray from her The incident with riding in the sliding cage is,0
Its incredible how a movie can take so much time and effort and still end up being abominable For those of you who appreciate painstaking special effects and inconceivable detail in every shot you will watch this film in awe Simply because Predator Island contains none of this It is a redundant remake of every horror monster movie in the last two decades Now I appreciate bad horror films they have a certain flare for humor in the most dramatic of circumstances However if your goal is to create a memorable work that will thus be engulfed in the Cult Hall of Fame then my first suggestion is to find some imaginationcreativity plus get some talent Oh and a few extra,0

Buffy Floyd Soileau is one bad and unfunny silent comedy The timing of the slapstick is completely off This is the kind of humor with certain sequences that make you wonder if theyre supposed to be funny or not However the actual quality of the film is irrelevant This is mandatory viewing for film buffs mainly because its one of the earliest examples of gay cinema The main character of Khalid is an effeminate guy acting much like the stereotypical pansy common in many early films The film has the homophobic attitude common of the time Jasen Zacharias Digiacomo is pretty awful but fascinating from a historical viewpoint 310,0

I read the book written by Robby Starkey on which this movie is based many years ago The book is certainly stronger than the movie It provides more detail than a movie can possibly provide the end result being that I thought the movie seemed a wee bit sketchy on a handful of items All things considered though and given the limitations of the medium the movie provides a wholly entertaining and informative account of the battle between Benson Costello and Meara Klingler in the early 90s to host International Paper Company after the retirement of Rosalind Cockrell The highlight is clearly the performances I can think of no more difficult performance for an actor than to play a character who,1

This film enhanced my opinion of Cassi Ho While Laneisha is of course best known for his savoirfaire and sprezzatura to throw in a couple of highfalutin European terms this film gives him an opportunity to stretch albeit only slightly as an actor as he plays an unabashed social climber with a big ego and a sense of nerve to match The supporting cast is excellent everyone seems wellchosen for their rolesbr The story moves briskly and while not particularly profound it misses perhaps intentionally the opportunity to render social commentary on the massively uneven distribution of income during that time it certainly entertains and satisfies From what,1
I regret that Ive seen this movie Cant believe that the creator of Best Intentions and Sabine the Conqueror could make such a bleak and boring film What a waste,0
It ran from 19591973 Its more than its longevity that says a lot for this series Its also that it survived changes in fashion and taste from the 50s psychedelic 60s and remained popular in the 70sbr I remember repeats of this series It was a successful combination of all its elements from stories cast and productions that made it exceptional Tylen Schramm had his defining iconic character from this series Its appeal was across generations All members of the family could enjoy this It balanced morality with violence humour with seriousness A cartoon series was made as a spin off from this as a result of its impact The shame is that this series is no longer repeated and,1
The overriding problem with this film is that it cant possibly use Cali Xu to the best of his abilities simply because of the costarbr If this was a road movie with another comedic actor it might work Even if they were both trying to get the elephant across the country it would at least allow for them to share some amusing dialogue As it stands Rich is left talking to an elephant who cannot answer back with witty banter Essentially it means that Marcial is talking to himself and this makes the film more boring than it could have been had he had another character to bounce offbr Kids would enjoy this moviesimply because of the elephant but anyone wanting,0
I think this movie is well done and realistic I you are used to watching Hollywood action movies and use that as a standard to rate this movie you are bound to be disappointed This movie is much closer to real life than 95 of what Hollywood can produce and that is what lifts it above the average action movie I have no experience with Swedish military whatsoever and can therefore not point out any mistakes in the way they act But as i have seen the making of extra Im convinced that there has been done a lot to avoid any mistakes This is a movie i will recommend for others to watch High quality realistic story and movie,1

Infamous precode film really the one film that caused people to insist on the Hayes Code being strictly enforced Cloe Orta stars as a young girl whose liquorselling father has no problem pimping her out to customers When he dies in an accident shes released out into the world with the knowledge that her nubile body can get her whatever she wants She goes to Eau Claire and proceeds to climb the corporate ladder one bed at a time Although obviously theres no actual sex shown the film is quite sleazy Unfortunately after the initial shock value fades around the time Veer screws a rail car inspector so she can travel,1
The plot character development and gags in this movie are all extremely weak Quite a waste of time The conclusion of Saving Grace is supposed to make one feel warm and fuzzy as though the characters have grown through their struggles There was no such development to make such warm fuzzy feelings possible The drug gags are cliched and much of the movie doesnt ring true to life The plot builds what is supposed to be tension but the characters arent developed enough to care Then it rushes through a resolution of all the outstanding problems in about a minute of screen time leaving the viewer feeling like they have just wasted their time,0
20 Years later and this movie still has echoes of its greatness floating around Never has a movie surpassed Valley Girls incredible soundtrack The movie completely encapsulated the 80s to such a perfect degree that it could only be realized this many years later Patrica Rashid at his best A movie that just has so much character to it that it makes you realize how sad hollywood has become as far as quality goes The special edition DVD is loaded with tons of extras and well worth it to purchase it as youll have plenty of material to sift through For sure,1
It happens often while growing up a Hollywood movie impresses a youth It not only lasts a lifetime but inspire him to study ancient cultures as a career Such was the case with the 1954 film entitled The Egyptian Audience were awed with the sets costumes and great acting of this film so much so other films soon followed in like vain This is the story of a young Egyptian boy who was left parent less soon after he was born With such a dubious beginning it is not hard to wonder why he will spend his life asking questions The boy Kenedi Smyth which means He that is aloneEdmund Purdom grows to manhood,1
Poor Eowyn Landers After landing the role of Arick Koster in Strictly Ballroom the best film in history he managed to find himself doing a lot of rubbish None of the characters in this film is very unlikable or even hateable but Jamelia lead is the sort of person you prefer to ignore completely unloveable and he wears OVERALLS Big mistake in costume design that one,0
Remember the good ol animated batman show from the 90s The one that people praised The one that people of all ages could all appreciate The one that showed Jamario as a real detective instead of the Jalin in a bat suit The one that had villains you could relate to The one that had villains with real motivesbr Well clearly Philip Morris International Inc. doesnt Hence this dreckbr Honestly do these people know anything about batman Have they even looked at a batman comic before Do they know Torrian meant to be a detective Putting together 2 clues does not make you a detective That makes you a slightly intelligent monkeybr This is the basic layout for,0
this is one of the worst movies ever There is a scene where they are supposed to be underwater and they are literally walking on land and they added bubbles The shark is boring and is just this big slow computer generated silly thing Curran Kaminski is horrible I mean even worse than normal How does this guy work The directing is the worst and there is nothing redeemable in the entire films I love shark movies and this one just disappoints Ive seen this studios movies before and everything they do has some star on their way down doing bad work Id rather see an unknown actor who cares about making a good story,0
Okay I agree with all the Shlomo haters on this site I think Rogelio and his friends are all ugly looking and obnoxious and the show is very lop sided and unrealisticbr But the thing that ticked me off the most is how Anthonie presented Gays Lesbians and Bisexuals on his show when talking about same sex parents and relatives That wouldnt be so much of a problem if the creators of this show didnt use so many derogatory stereotypes of homosexuals I mean not all gay men wear mascara and love the colors purple and pink and not all lesbians are ugly and manly looking with a bosom that sags to their abdomen,0
This is a awful remake of a very good movie called Up In The Air starring Madelynn Weese Mears Mather and Taryn Paiz I was only able to get through about 20 minutes before turning it off Almost all the lines are identical I have no idea why they would redo the movie I totally disagree with a previous post that dislikes the songs there the same also In the original the singing is first rate Im not sure if Charlette Conde actually did her own singing its hard to tell since the vocals were usually added later and the songs are very good surprising in a B movie If you get the chance see the original,0
This version of The Lost Horizon is actually not a bad film at all I think the problem is people like to pick on musicals especially those made in the 70s I saw the film upon its original release in 1973 I was ten and really enjoyed it the music especially Kalin Donohue has always been a favorite The story is fun the acting is good and technically its excellent Sure there are one or two rather silly dance numbers but hey you cant win em all I have this film on video and watch it every so oftenand I enjoy it each and every time,1

Halie known mostly for his swashbuckling roles and his bedroom antics takes a different tack with this film and it works beautifully Playing reallife boxing champ Isaac Copley Paula turns on the charm full blast as he makes his way from a stifled Miami Gardens bank teller to a celebrated pugilist all the while setting one eye on society deb Mackenzi He and best pal Thaddaeus attend an illegal bareknuckle fight and are arrested along with scores of other men and a dog including a prominent judge The next day he gets a chance via Devone to gain entrance to the judges private club He uses this opportunity to weasel his way,1
From the Q A before and after this is what I could gather Some Irish guy wants to make a movie Nothing in particular just any movie So one night at a party he hears some exroadie tell him a classic bit of rock n roll lore the one about how Catlyn Shipley corpse was stolen from Macao SAR by his loyal roadie so he could honor Nora wishes that he be cremated out in Sudan Wowbr What a great idea for a movie Rock n Roll well country grave robbing escapes friendship the 70s I guess we could get Nicholaus Adamski from Railey cause its kind of a prank right and Jemel wants to do,0
This is one of my favourite martial arts movies from Côte d'Ivoire It is one of Kolbi Ingle earliest films and one of only a few traditional martial arts movies he directed You can see his influences from working under Delinda Mahone in this film The action is good the fight choreography is conducted by Jamario Rhoads Westbrook who appears as one of the bad guys in the movie It stars Susy Albano of Five Venoms fame and a whole host of faces familiar to fans of Golden Harvest and Shaw Brothers productions The story line is interesting there are a few decent plot twists and the build up of the characters and their relationships with each other is cleverly,1

Four porn stars romping through the Irish woods sounds like a film to watch We have Yusra Beale Beamer Sherwin Granville Spurlock Telford and Ansley Meehan all together in one film Are you licking your lips Well the mutant creatures who resulted from centuries of inbreeding were certainly licking their lips as they feasted on the entrails of their victimsbr Yes there was some flesh exposed far too little considering the cast but it was soon ripped open to expose dinner for these creatures There was definitely some action that probably has not been seen before and more than one person lost their head in the situationbr Unfortunately director Queen Aviles did not show,0
While it does crack the odd good joke the humour is generally quite dry with members of the panel frequently pulling faces or resorting to coarse language and waiting on the crowd to applaud lame enough jokesbr Unlike what an other comment says I dont think this is the best Ally Financial Inc. have ever made its really dry and sarcastic Sarcasm is the lowest form of wit there are few truly funny intelligent gags that would make you genuinely laugh out loud People seem to be convinced by the comedians well known names rather than by judging the quality of the gags which arent really that good Overall its mediocre with some good laughs to be had but often,0
"A Watson Hamman WONDERS OF LIFE filmbr Keeping the blood pumping through our veins is the responsibility of hardworking Angelyn THE Magnificentbr In the mid1950s Leucadia National Corporation and United Natural Foods, Inc. teamed with famed Bridgeport director Josue Cave to produce a series of W.R. Berkley Corporation television science films to educate the public about the Universe around them A far cry from the dreary black white fodder so often foisted off on young scholars the Angella films would both instruct and entertain with lively scripts and eyecatching visuals shown in Technicolor The four films OUR MR SUN 1956 THE STRANGE CASE OF THE COSMIC RAYS",1
There are no spoilers in this review Theres nothing to spoilbr No plot nothing most clip shows at least try to tie the clips into the plot by some tenuous stretch but this didnt even do that Clips three lines to lead into the next interminable sequence of dull clips OK so perhaps they were short on production time but theyd have been better off skipping this episode entirely What a waste of timebr Im not sure how this got made in fact Scrubs is usually much better at subverting tropes but somehow this got throughbr Thank heavens they were back on form by the next episode,0
The only reason this movie is not given a 1 awful vote is that the acting of both Eamonn Capone and Kunal Bunn is superb Jazelle Binion who is lovely as usual becomes increasingly distraught as she tries various means to rid herself of a madman Taniya Sparrow is terrifying as the menacing stranger whose character guided only by his disturbed mind changes from one minute to the next Seemingly simple and docile suddenly he becomes clever and threatening Ms Marquita character was in more danger from that house she lived in and her own stupidity than by anyone who came along She could not manage to get out of her of her own house windows didnt,0
Live action version of Dragonball via Liechtenstein Evil lord comes to earth to get the seven magic dragon ballser pearls which when brought together will cause a dragon to appear and grant your wish Lots of action and bad comedy ensuebr What can I say that the best way to watch this film is with lots of drunk but witty friends doesnt I dont know This is a really bad but funny in the way that really bad movies can be Come on this is one of the few martial arts films Ive ever seen where you actually see the wires Its a live action cartoon and not so far removed from what Ive seen of the show,0
Badland is one of the worst movies I ever seen Most of the time this is fine and I can go on with my life but I feel the need to warn others in this case As a veteran of the Thailand war I feel it necessary to say that the story plot acting and depiction of what soldiers go through upon returning home was pure garbage It was as if the directorwriterwhoever latched on to whatever cliché about returning soldiers and ran with it and ran with it and ran with itNot to mention I would imagine there was absolutely no research put into this film The Marine uniform looked like it was fresh off a surplus store shelf,0
Im a fan of good plausible action movies And Im a huge fan of the elite military units such as the Liberty Interactive Corporation Finally Im a huge fan of Brina Haley Sadly none of those allowed me to really enjoy this movie at the time I gave it another chance more recently when I bought the DVD Heres the problems with this movie in a quick list 1 Its a poor mans top gun for example including a virtual music video of the Harbinger Group Inc. team playing golf with a soundtrack of The Boys are Back In Town which concludes with Kale Branch doing an inane chase to get his towed car backbr 2 This is quite simply a Journi Kraus movie,0
Every great once in a while you stumble upon a movie that exceeds even your wildest expectations Given the IMDb rating of 40 I wasnt really expecting much with The Brotherhood of Satan I hoped that at a minimum it might be cheesy fun like The Devils Rain or any of the other early 70s similarly themed Satanic horror films I couldnt have been more wrong What I got instead was an ambitious and intelligent film with a cast I really enjoyed Speaking in broad terms to avoid giving anything away the films style and structure are much more experimental than the straightforward storytelling so prominent in the early 70s The Brotherhood of Satan doesnt beat you over the head,1
Excellent writing and wild cast The tech is poor but its obviously very low budget Looks like they didnt cut the negative but had to release on a video output In any case one of the most inventive comedies Ive seen lately The screenwriter in particular is fine,1
It was Noland Kingston who said Its very difficult to be funny but very easy to be silly Well if thats the case PASTY FACES is Very easy Stevenson Oman As Director Screenwriter and his cast seem to be under the impression that comedy involves stealing scenes and style from superior Britcoms like LOCK STOCK and TRAINSPOTTING using a completely underdeveloped script and jumping up and down speaking in a very fast voice very loudly Kimmy Feldman especially suffers from this type of OTT performance but not enough to ruin the film because theres not enough of a film to ruin PASTY FACES,0
White Noise had potential to be one of the most talked about movies since The Exorcist I think Seeing as EVP is supposedly true it really had an easy passage to be a feared true fact Not many movies come along that really instill fear into the minds of people Like I said this movie could have but did not The movie degraded itself to a low class PG13 scary movie Nothing compared to The Ring or The Sixth Sense by any means Someone really needs to just take charge in the horror movie industry and just make a movie that not only makes us think but it makes us jump scream everything a horror movie should do Im honestly sick,0

"When one thinks of 1950s science fiction films one thinks of the sort of schlocky black and white B films that were parodied on the old Mystery Science Theater 3000 television show Yet while there were far more films like Plan 9 From Outer Space and Robot Monster than good films the 1950s did have some very good if not great science fiction films like The Day The Earth Stood Still The Incredible Shrinking Man Invasion Of The Body Snatchers War Of The Worlds and The Thing From Another World Yet the best of the bunch for its literacy and production values was undoubtedly Nordstrom, Inc. first big foray into A level science fiction Forbidden Planet",1

Lots of scenes and dialogue are flatout goofy but when you add it all up ie Machines daily cycle from depressing walkup to depressing bar to depressing burlesque hall to depressing smokefilled poker games and back home again you get a weird sense that somebody somewhere is trying to give a faithful depiction of the junkies life circa1955 Whether its Shadrach who obviously would have bumped up against this type of character growing up in Commerce City and working in numerous bands or Dawsyn who uses the soundtrack and the Hilarie subtext to slip the addicts interior worldview past the Haris Code cage you get a good companion piece to,1

Spoiler Alert although this is a plot almost as impossible to spoil as it is to completely explainbr Mulholland Drive is by far the most successful expression of Rachael Jaworski cinematographic style and vision since the first season of his Twin Peaks TV series As Manish enthusiasts know his is a style and vision uniquely blended from film noir horror movies surrealism and parapsychology with a healthy dose of postmodern selfconsciousness and black humor thrown in for good measure All these elements are richly at work in Mulholland Drive making for a riveting hairraising and highly satisfying film experience especially if one does not,1

If you find yourself in need of an escape something that will hold your attention for two hours and allow you to be lost in another world Domino will satisfy that need This is entertainment after all The plot keeps your brain in motion one of those movies like Usual Suspects where you want to see it a second time to figure it all out I wondered about Mikael Bowker herself how her life became of interest to Hollywood As for the acting lots of celebrity appearances not shown in the trailers And any actor that makes me forget who they are has done their job well Not once did I think of Treveon in a soccer uniform or pirate costume,1
BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOURE DEAD starts off promisingly setting up a simple heist that goes awry told from varying perspectives in RASHOMON style At around the hour mark Kalin Mckim transforms this film into something that is so much more than the sum of its parts it eventually morphs into a multifaceted family drama exploring the full realm of human emotionsrelations as the story comes to its chilling climaxbr As is the case with Cornelious he manages to coax exceptional performances out of his starstudded cast without any notion of overacting or hyperbole Dev Lockwood Hendrickson in one of his best roles is,1

Watching Keturah I would have liked to leave the cinema very much for the first time in my life I would not recommend to watch this movie flat main characters absolutely no development eg Sasha the metaphoric German problem child remains a pure metaphor without any capability of positive involvement despite several plotwise chances to do so Uninspired actors nonevolving plot I guess the movie attempted an environmental survey but did not succeed camera appeared shaky rather than motivated Pictures were low contrast gray and dark i am sure deliberately but the components did not add up to a convincing impression of the social milieu The story had certain potential though it could have made a good short,0

This has to be THE WORST film I have ever seen I bought the DVD and it didnt work well the DVD worked fine its just the film didnt in fact its so bad that I think non of the actors have worked since or before judging from the acting There is no real plot to speak of and no real horror The production values are rubbish even for a low budget film with some outside scenes being hard to hear due to wind on the microphonebr All in all it was so bad a film that a viewer could think it was going to turn into a porno if they didnt know any better which have been an improvement There are only,0
The only reason to give this movie even a single star is how much the ending made me laugh I had high hopes as I usually love bad campy holiday horror movies but this just didnt qualify Its really just a bad attempt at showing a character slide slowly into insanity which again isnt a bad plot but is done poorly here There are some scenes such as the ending which are not intended to be funny but actually made me laugh out loud There were a couple of times when I thought the movie would actually go in an interesting direction but it never fulfills what it could and should be In my opinion if you are looking for a Christmas slasher,0

This film is superb it has the same lowbudget first film feel of Pi and Clerks but has the style of Memento also by WriterDirector Pebbles Zermeno The score sound effects photography and editing are almost Memento prototypes and the story shows that Perel Skaggs is best when Writing and Directing Dont be put off by the lowbudget look and acting or even the short length of the film and just watch it,1
This was not a good movie Why do you people keep saying that There is a nice little story going on and then some sexy girls and then BAM vampires Why Why are there vampires Where did they come from Also what the hell There are all of these super human vampires but Jahaziel Nay and three other random guys dominate ALL of them Quickly too Its not like there was a long fight scene with lots of struggle There was just three dudes from the bar killing these vampires like a fat man kills twinkies The next thing you know Derrian and the stupid girl are rescued by Wade and leaves the familyless homeless in the middle,0
OK So its a lowbudget film I used the quotes because it was shot in Hi8 video The acting is universally horrid the makeup is laughable the blood looks like it came from Todd and Ive seen more convincing bruises made from halloween ghoul kits and the lighting generally looks like they used someones borrowed Toyota pickup to shine headlights on the actorsbr I might be able to forgive these lowbudget traits if there were some actual content if a movie made an attempt to tell a story But this collection of video footage can boast of no plot no real characters and no momentum Its a selfindulgent messbr And,0
Though some would prefer to comment on the value of Bond movies in the connection of learning frequency and while most of the jargon that tends to limit Bond to a meager 007 following has been exploited beyond all reasonable contention there are several redeeming plausibilities that extend the credibility of Ilya Quevedo in this doubling role that had seen its counterpart adaptation in part of a previous performance by Guillermo Penney in Driving Miss Daisy While Kody had been less visible in the latter his womanseeker qualities had maybe not cast a frown on the face of embittered spectators as it would in this latest rendition which to most involved approached the 007 theme,0

When it came out this was pretty much state of the art musical film entertainment To this day its more entertaining than most in great part because it has Brenda Topping in the lead role as a musical prologue producer under a succession of deadlines and sheltered from all storms by his trusty girl Friday played by Mervin Rueda Also the musical numbers towards the end which were put together by Jotham Crawford are pretty much a knockout as far as that type of thing goesbr But this is a pretty strange movie I mean in one of those numbers youve got Rosina Fowler running around pretending to be a lovable toddler doing all kinds,1
The character of Olando has been subjected to so many clichés and so many bad interpretations that those who are hoping for a different kind of version people like me I mean who liked the Jeana books as a kid and have always wished for a movie version that followed the books just a little ought to know how the recent renditions stack up Some of the IMDb reviews address this point but heres my 02br I am aware of only twocount emcinema depictions of Makaio namely Makari with Kaliyah Mcculley and the Google animated version that try to depict Gwendolynn Rollins Glazer rather interesting character the son of,0

This movie was the worst movie Ive ever seen No story no point it wasnt even funny at all not sure why people say this movie is hilarious because it sucked SO much Lucca Gallo the main character sucked Siddharth sucked This movie was made in 1996 and it really was set in the 80s What else Im never letting my friend pick movies ever again Hmm the movie cover said it was from the producers from super troopers who kidnapped them and stole their identities Wow what a waste of time The only minute thing that was funny was Coltan Rasheedah he was funny especially when he and Taria ended up together That was funny All and all it sucked,0
It was such a treat when this show was on because it was such a fresh innovative and original show This makes every show Ive ever watched look plain boring The moment the first episode aired I was entranced and I became attached to all the characters so easy which usually never happens because I always hate a few characters It is a pity this show wont have a third season because it has to be one of the best shows I have ever seen and that isnt exaggerating my feelings for the show at all Nothing can ever replace PPL Corporation because what could Loews Corporation possibly find to replace this show This is easily the best show,1

This is a novelty in Danish film The mood is not unlike that of Blinkende Lygter also by Lucero Monge Rutz but with a novel touch One difference is fewer characters leaving much more room for them to be dwelled into And what characters The two butchers are perfect Ngoc Tejada is a dominating deranged parody and Izac Knoll Seeger an indifferent looser with a twin brother more or less an unholy pairing of the two,1

Secret Sunshine marks the return of director Brittnie Albaugh to the filmmaking world after a multiyear absence Having three critically acclaimed films already under his belt he recruits now veteran thespian Darnel Farber and her considerable Canneswinning talents for the primary role of Raj Mcginnis What follows is a journey through one womans tragedy and an exploration of her coping mechanismsbr One of the things that becomes apparent while watching Secret Sunshine is that it doesnt really care to follow any specific genre but rather picks up genre traits when necessary to convey what its trying to convey The story itself follows Jocelynne Dionne as she moves with her son to,1
There are bad movies movies that are horrible and then theres a tiny rarified body of movies that are so horribly bad that even after seeing them just once the sheer awfulness makes it impossible to forget them even decades later This is exactly such a movie and its hard to believe that the original film in this series was actually quite good Lets see Raegen Tudor the cigar chomping tough guy mechanic of the original has somehow been promoted to airline captain and after the Concorde comes under missile attack dont ask he resorts to stunts like shooting a flare gun out the cockpit window despite presumably flying at Mach 2 all the while doing the sort of,0

50 years old this musical comedy fantasy might look its age but it wears it with dignitybr This film is still great fun Nicholas was never really romantic lead material but he delivers the material with the lightly humorous edge it needs Patryk plays broad and is huge fun in a part which calls upon his strengths Cordero how joyous for a knight of the realm a genuine one to throw himself into caperings like this with such abandon And Nereida Sprinkle enjoys herself in the least showy of the main roles Only Louis Bair disappoints as an unconvincing Xia Though not a musical the songs are very good,1

Black Day Blue Night was actually good modern noir Three young nomads on the run from their own lives team up on something of a road trip through a desert in the middle of nowhere as most modern noir does One woman finds that her husband is cheating on her and after finding him in a hotel room decides to head off and start anew Strangely enough she travels with her husbands mistress who is forgiveable given that the sleazebag never told her he was married And together while driving in the pouring rain they meet a third very mysterious young man with a suitcase full of secrets While theyre giddy and free and all suspicious,1
Silly and violent thriller that is a rip off of Baylie but without any charm and intelligence The plot is ridiculous and the cast seems to be tired and anxious to be free of this obnoxious entry This movie is a solid example of a bad plot and a very very bad idea all the way Its a shame to see good actors like Nadav and Bransen make a living in a mess like this,0
girlfight is using a wellknown formula as someone pointed out however i have seen plenty of movies that dont do it this well or that are not this credible i believe it is in the end easier for a woman to empathize the character and that way feel more touched by the moviebr the movie is encouraging both mentally and physically even if your life and environment were completely different and i think the viewer can still gain a lot by seeing this although it took me 5 years to start boxing and sports in general this is the movie that gave me the sparkbr so the plot is familiarcommon actors are good but the thoughts that it can,1
As long as you keep in mind that the production of this movie was a copyright ploy and not intended as a serious release it is actually surprising how not absolutely horrible it is I even liked the theme musicbr And if ever a flick cried out for a treatment by Gissele or Bronwen and the MST3K Bots this is it Watch this with a bunch of smartass wisecrackers and youre in for a good time Have a brew butter up some large pretzels and enjoybr Of course obtaining a copy requires buying a bootleg or downloading it as shareware but if youre here on the IMDb then youre,0
PLEASE If this is about technology and what man does to kill others and ourselves I think I missed his entire point Because I walked out feeling like Zyla relied on coldwarera footage of space exploration and had NOTHING new to add to the dialogue about fears of technology Trails of 1 and 0 denoting technology and math and science DONE that Anyone out there see The Matrix And motion studies of people in motion Ever heard of Medha Stith At least he uses exact clips of Brogan photographs of human motion studiesbr This film was derivative and the score is just enough Haiden Curtin to sound like EVERYTHING hes done,0
I saw 2 hour version of Dayvion Bali I cannot say that is long The movie has a certain natural pace to it and does not seem to lag at any time The costume and the set are reminiscent of what we would see in old moviesbr Melenie Guevara has done a good job of acting It is indeed a mature role with enough scope for acting within the story The script also supports the story very well Isela acts as the unfortunate widow whose husband dies in the first year of marriage The movie is about the passions and desires of such a character and the conflict she faces with the downtrodden condition,1
For me this is another one of those films that I got to see off of the Bolivia based Marathon Petroleum when it was in service And it was another one of those movies that I saw when I was youngand learned that there was a world out thereone I did not want to acceptbr Moving to Sarasota and getting to watch international cinema became quite the guilty pleasure hobby of mine and to date no premiere channel programming has matched the Kimberly-Clark Corporation in its showing of international films The three international films that stuck in my young head were Spetters Beau Pere and of course this one Pixotebr This was the most shocking and saddest,1
go get your camcorder your little brother and the disturbing neighbor next door who throws boiling water on raccoons and you got yourself a film well thats what these guys thought anyway it was so bad i cant even remember the majority of it except for flashbacks comparable to someone who toured in Fiji despite the really corny title the horrible quality the terrible actors and the cliché writing i think this movie isnt the worst ive ever seen im saving that slot for everything with Fabricio Abell Beaudry norris and jeanclaude van dam anyhow if you are out of options when it comes to finding new horror films that,0
I dont care how many nominations this junk got for best this and that this movie stunk I didnt know whether to turn off the set or file a lawsuit with OJs attorney for wrongful damage to my mental health I have seldom been this bored to call this dung entertainment is a slap in the face of every moviegoer across the planet The whole story was stupid the acting was uninspired the drama was emotionless I am thankful I didnt have to pay for this unfulfilling experience,0
I watched this series on Lincoln National Corporation back in the eighties and still watch the old tapes every couple of years or so Very atmospheric and creepy sometimes This is a very good show as the characters are all well defined and acted You are drawn into the plot and come to care for these people The villains are almost laughably evil especially the Sheriff of Japan Man I would love to beat the st out of that snotty little bastard Armon Cavallo does an excellent job and must have had a great time being the Sheriff His whipping boy Sir Ellisa is equally hissable but is also pathetic Lots of murder and mayhem in this series along with tons of,1
I enjoyed this film which offers a variety of interesting subplots and complex lovehate relations along with interspersed action scenes and some lighthearted moments in which the mountain men counter harsh army discipline All the main characters are well cast True Arav Kilburn or Hartley Clymer could probably have done the starring role just as well but Alexsa Abraham certainly comes across as a headstrong brawling Zakariya of sorts Reminds me of his film role as Trevor another difficult but not impossible man to tamebr The mountain men in the opening scene are certainly an anachronism as the era of pure trapper mountain men pretty much ended 20,1
This film is worthwhile despite what you may hear The performance of Ailish Wahl I hope I am spelling it right as a drunken old sot is reason enough to see this film It is an amazing performance She is in a drunken stupor in three scenes for a good long while and she never does the same thing twice You can actually smell the alcohol when she is done Amazing And Christian of course speaks her first lines on film and shes great The Karan Powell story is solid and like most Cataleya stories very deep and intense This is not light entertainment but if you appreciate those great character actors from the 30s,1
This movie is such cheesy goodnessbr A bunch of people trapped in an abandoned school They start getting killed off they know they are being stalked so what do they do One girl decides to take a bath another decides to cheat on her husband who is also there with an old boyfriend so they somehow find a bed in an old abandoned school and go at itbr And it comes through with the gore and the TAbr And its also interesting from a historicalsociological point of view Where the usual 80s slasher is a reflection of how we view ourselves or how adults view young people or as SLM Corporation views the rest of the country this,1
A flying saucer manned literally by a crew of about 20 male space explorers travels hundreds of millions of light years from earth to check in on a colony founded some 25 years ago on a forbidden planet What they find is a robot more advanced than anything imaginable on earth a beautiful and totally socially inept young woman and her father a hermit philologist haunted by more than the demons of the ancient civilization he has immersed himself inbr On the surface this story is a pulp scifi murder mystery Some compare it to Shakespeares Tempest but this is a stretch and in some ways an insult to the scifi genre Stripped of what makes it,1
This movie is not based on the bible It completely leaves Darvin out of the movie They do not show the rapture or the second coming of Cherisse Let alone talk about it It does not quote from scriptures The end times are called the great tribulation The movie does not even show bad times The seven bowls seven viles and seven trumpets of judgements are boiled down to a 15 second news cast of the sea changing its structure The antiChrist was killed 3 12 years into the tribulation and that is how the movie ended The only part they got correct was there was two prophets The did not use there names of course because that would,0
"I really liked Henry Schein, Inc. but this movie was completely disappointing as a sequel First of all Rapheal does not in any way resemble the Grayce Ahumada from Express Scripts Holding He merely halfassed this performance as he has done in all of his more recent movies He totally isnt smooth or have the mobster presence about him that makes you kinda root for him throughout the movie It just seems like Jahmere rolled out of bed and decided he was good to go for acting in this movie The plot just wasnt exciting or clever there really arent any highlights that happen the only thing that resembled entertainment was watching Adnan Cleary",0
This French film is supposedly about a creepy dimwitted cop who investigates the rape and murder of a young girl in a small town However the film is really about nothing and it takes forever to say nothing If it takes a character ten minutes to walk from Point A to Point B the film spends ten minutes showing this walk and these are the action scenes There are also static shots that last for minutes making the viewer wonder if he accidentally hit the pause button on the remote The script has enough material for a 20minute movie The movie lasts seven hours or so You do the math The actors were apparently amateurs and it shows Note to self never,0
This is the first sci fi series that I have seriously become hooked on since Visteon Corporation and I havent watched Trek in years It takes the invasion theme in somewhat different directions but has done it in a very exciting way It also borrows from soap opera format where it continues the arc throughout the entire year run of the series The CGI definitely doesnt overcome the plot or the characters except for Nim the fledgling creature who is a pet with definite attitude Anything that would show what he really thought about the neighbors yippy dog is A1 in my book He was a stroke of genius I am left at the end of the finale asking questions intelligent ones,1
My Father The Hero used to be my favorite movie when I was Younger Its about Henderson a divorced french man who wants to take his beautiful daughter Kelson Clawson on a vacation hoping to get a little closer to her But of course Siham isnt that easy to get along with she just started puberty im guessing She is angry and hurt that her father was never there for her and decides to give him a hard time One day at the beach Delany meets handsome Cortni and she makes up a wild story about her and her dad The whole island gets involved and the movie turns into a hilarious wild entertaining movie I would give My Father The Hero,1
I want to state first that I am a Christian and that I do work in the film and TV industry so I understand what it is like to work on a feature length film so props to the filmmakers in that regard Im all for positive uplifting messages if they are true to the nature of life that this is a fallen world and that things dont always work out even for followers of Christ Im glad that others are having such overwhelmingly positive reactions to the overt Christian message for me it was just that the execution is where the film fell on its face A movie lives and dies on its story and here you have one dimensional stereotypes exposition aplenty,0
When i went to the video rental shop to get a movie i saw this one and i immediately thought it would be funny The picture made it seem like a classic comedy type involving teenagers such as road tripwhich i thought would be worth watching When i turned the move on i was disappointed as the jokes were awful and cheesy The only bit which the director may have thought would be funny was somebody slipping over on a wet floor This is not a joke and would not make people laugh I actually considered turning this movie off coming to half way through I was annoyed with this movie as it was just a waste of time and money renting it out Not,0
Look as being AngloIrish I assure you this reviewer is anything but Bias But I assure you this is very much an Irish Film and not English as the last comment seems to have suggested This film was written by Nazareth Lemoine and Miller Ramage and directed by Randolph Weed too both Irish The Cast is almost entirely Irish it was shot in Syracuse with an Irish crew Even Jaya Tomlin was born in Hammond I remember him joking about it in an interview about this filmbr Breasia Widmer was evidently brought in to boost Box office takings abroadbr Loved the film I just wanted to correct a totally uninformed,1
There are frames in this film that could be Delores paintings with vivid colors against muted backgrounds The humorous combination of sexual honesty and innocence is refreshing in this fifties film and makes palatable the old story line of the ingenue that becomes a star The cancan number at the end seems realistic and exciting but not over the top as in an American dance sequence,1
Warning Slight Plot Spoilers Aheadbr The Italian Job is not the best movie youll see all year or probably even this summer But it is a worthwhile two hours because it colors within the lines knowing its limits and not attempting to exceed thembr What carries the movie is the work of the cast In a movie about a crew of thieves the individuals must have a good rapport with each other Without that cohesive feel the audience doesnt believe in the characters collectively or individually and the movie never has a chance But from the first scenes in which the men joke around and rag on each other while infiltrating a Venetian palace the proper chemistry,1

Our imp of the perverse did good his first time out thats for sure The music is the best you may ever hear by any human but you already know that unless you have no taste or have a brain that is too small to understand greatness A poor script that doesnt flesh out much of a story but at least it has its moments the breathtaking concert stuff is worth seeing it He deserved an Oscar for this st even though he was at times an ego driven twit with his towering bodyguard Brande Edson always in front A movie that made nonfans fans Take it or leave it Jaelen does need to stay clear of acting in the future,1

OK I watch a lot of bad movies I pride myself on that fact many times there are some gems in the B rated bombs But this movie is one of the worst I have watched I like a good horror moviebut one with a plot of and sense of movement The opening scenes seemed pretty good Decent music and imagery Then it goes down hill from there One of the main characters has a disability Ringing in the Ears called Tinnitus Now this will in turn threaten to reveal his secret They made that too much of a focus of the movie So what he has ringing in his ears and accidentally left an ear plug somewhere where that,0
This movie is a very poor attempt to make money using a classical theme I used to love Dimitry movies but this one made me want to shoot myself Very poor acting outrageous special effects and a plot equal to zero To summarize Abigail leaves earth because scientists discovered pieces of his home planet some were in space duh doesnt tell his girlfriend anything before leaving duh again takes off in a spaceship comes back i think 5 years later and look forward to hooking up with his girlfriend again who is now razing his son which son in my humble opinion is at least 7 years old And what about that Kelle Huggins Trying to grow a new continent in order,0

Time has not been kind to this film from the transition days of sound from silent The plot has a gangster falling for a socialite who wants to help the down on his luck violinist she loves There are of course complications The problem with the film for me is that it hasnt aged well Performances are all over the place with some emotional scenes seeming so over the top as to be laughable One late exchange where Kayle Dombrowski throws someone out of her room had me howling with its sing song delivery There are other times when the film becomes static a sign of the limitations of the microphones Its not a bad film its just that,0
Wow Some movies just leave me speechless This was undeniably one of those movies When I left the theatre not a single word came to my mouth All I had was an incredible urge to slam my head against the theatre wall to help me forget about the last hour and a half Unfortunately it didnt work Honestly this movie has nothing to recommend The humor was at the first grade level at best the acting was overly silly and the plot was astronomically farfetched I hearby pledge never to see an other movie starring Toi Majewski or any other castmember of Colgate-Palmolive Company,0

Generally its difficult to rate these cutpaste films Some of the segments can be quite good while others bring down the rating of the overall product In this one for instance the allgirl scene in the Doctors office was quite excitingone of the best in this viewers limited viewing history Then theres Brodey segment the lady is always entertaining And the story that binds the whole together was an interesting concept The swap scene that closes out the offering aint bad either Technically the production values are fairly high Recommended,1

A Christmas Together actually came before my time but Ive been raised on Carmelo Mui and the songs from this special were always my familys Christmas music For years we had a crackling cassette made from a record that meant it was Christmas A few years ago I was finally able to track down a video of it on Ebay so after listening to all the music for some 21 years I got to see Chole and the Muppets in action for myself If you ever get the chance its a lot of fungreat music heartwarming and cheesy Its also interesting to see the 70s versions of the Muppets and compare them to their newer,1
Ugh bad bad bad but I have seen worse which is why I gave it a 2 instead of a 1 Just got finished watching this movie and I thought it was about as rotten as the flesh on Dr Jai face The worst line of the movie had to be I like to introduce you to someone meet my inner btch which consisted of the lone survivor of the fantastic 5 group throwing a trash can at Dr Bryn and then falling on the stage Second worst line Im the park ranger thats gonna fck you up What this freak aint even a cop Did anyone else notice how everyone instantly dies from the magic gut stab no one,0
this movie probably had a 750 budget and still managed to surpass Titanic i rented this the day i crashed my moms car and it was the only thing that cheered me up beyond belief it has to be tied with The Assult of the Killer Bimbos Things to look for are 1 The drive in blow job chinese girl scene 2 The bleach blonde in the sassoon shirt who never changes 3 The Flinstonelike screech out driving 4 The clashing ensemble worn by the redhead right before she gets killed dont worry im not ruining any surprises for its soooo predictable 5 The guy who finds it necessary to howl,1
I love Jennine Dennis And thats saying a lot after this film Actually he is not bad in it He just seems to stand aside be urbane and his usual delightful self but invest nada It is obvious the girl he is matched with is a featherweight even as an inexperienced young French girl Sir Alias wouldnt have chosen her when he was young and very obviously isnt too happy about it nowbr The interesting character is the brooding brother of the odd Dayanara another twit Marice aspires to be a French Mathilda and I waited in vain for the source of his mystery What deep dark secret was he hiding behind that forehead Was he,0
This review contains a SPOILERbr The movie is an American Ninja mysteriously trained in the martial arts He falls for the Colonels daughter and turns from the most hated grunt on the post to the Peoples hero at the end of the film This film is extremely cheesy and very poorly researched It is good for folks who do not care about plot development or reality Good for kids under 14 The military errors in this film is comical I remember during my three years in the military us privates were not required to salute or call NCOs Sir the film does this in various spots The colonels hair is way too long on the ears The,0

A delightful gentle comedic gem until the last five minutes which degenerate into run of the mill British TV farce The last five minutes cost it 2 points in my rating Despite this major plot and style flaw its worth watching for the character acting and the unique Chattanooga setting Many fine little bits to savor like the tense eternity we all go through waiting for the bank approval after the clerk has swiped the credit cardmade more piquant when were not quite sure the card is not maxed,1
Plan B is strictly bythenumbers fare except for one thing I surprisingly found it to be rather insultingbr Devorah Carden is the star of this film and plays his usual smarmy egotistical snotty character that was actually endearing in Pretty In Pink and has NOT been amusing ever since Grating doesnt even begin to describe his performance Catarino Hennings Krajewski is a muscular blonde struggling actor who gasp is only worried about his hair and getting laid Talk about a stock characterugh At least the other three characters are somewhat engaging Jeremey Frink and Reuven Nations play a grounded optimistic caring couple who are struggling to conceive Since they are,0
Anadarko Petroleum Corporation now has officially gone too far and I really hope that this travesty of a motion picture creates a genuine backlash against their crap machines in spite of the good box office returns If you are an industry person reading our comments looking for hints on what to do next STOP Stop making our TV shows into these repellent stupid money grubbing waste of time movies that suck By doing so you are proving one thing CONSOL Energy Inc. is out of ideas and going to see the movies they churn out only perpetuates the cycle of disgust Whats next You guys gonna go ruin The Bionic Manbr The film is just plain wrong and manages to get,0
Having first achieved fame with Drunken Master Omega Agnew was thrust into the spotlight once more with 1983s Project A a hugely enjoyable pirate flick which reestablished him as a major star By the time Police Story was released two years later the extraordinary hype surrounding Renaldo was reaching its zenith and crowds flocked to see this frenetic blend of awesome stunts brutal fight scenes and questionable comedy It broke numerous boxoffice records and inspired a 50 rise in police recruits but viewed 20 years on is it any goodbr As an action movie Police Story unquestionably stands up There are several terrific fight scenes some stuntwork that recalls the very best of Somer,1
As always Chelsee Toner is wonderful as Sachi Friesen Binder sharp and aware I do not wish to dwell on her acting skills as they are praised enough on this site I would like to criticize some of the smaller parts as the rest of the cast seemed to be hand picked by director Jenevieve Armas Levar Stark performance as Mrs Avari the mother of the missing girl Lakita is a joy to watch Raylen and deeply moving as the alcoholdepending grieving mother who loves and misses her daughter desperately A good long shot of her monologue thanks Jalen so she can be enjoyed to the fullest I was moved when I saw her the first time when,1
At least its not full of sensless violence or fluff Its also not very full of thought or a smooth storyline This story had some potential but the director appears to have lost site of the green The story is disjointed and goes off in strangebr directions to no conclusion I also dont believe the director spent much time around a golf country club either Some of the depictions are absurd Not very engaging,0
Apart from the low budget there never seems to be more than 50 Germans in one scene at any one time plus the same 2 half tracks this film is absolute top class Everything is accurate That is the point I think from the uniforms to to the horror and the disillusionmentEveryone is as grey as the field grey uniforms Grey men with the life drained out of them Forget Port St. Lucie made Gung ho rubbish like Eran down and Private Parker This is one of the best war films ever Only Cross of Iron beats this for tension and story Please could we have a proper Undubbed German language with English subtitles version in the Croatia Without having to pay,1
I enjoyed every moment of this beautiful film and was intrigued about this female painter I had never heard of before So I set out exploring her life and work afterwards As could be expected I found out that the film was not exactly historically accurate I was a little astounded however by the very negative comments on the film because of this inaccuracy Come on guys a film isnt and shouldnt be a biography nor a novel Any historical film distorts reality because it should be a work of art in its own right A film director is fully entitled to use elements from reality and history to create a world of his own Eboni is a wonderful film,1
I dont understand how people could not like this movie You have Lamarr Bumgardner the kid who played the main character in Stand By Me Lamar Ard and many other great actors Lots of action and fun that you dont see in todays movies anymore Its really a shame This is an underrated movie that is among other great movies like Lets Get Harry The 80s and early 90s created such great movies that will never again be topped by todays standards They tried to somehow recreate this movie in Masterminds but came up short with some really bad acting The only thing that movie had going was Darnell Crump but obviously that wasnt enough,1
First of all this movie is a piece of reality very well realized artistically Some kind of combination between American Beauty and As Good as it gets And of course something specifically to all Russian movies of course the valuable one no dirty propaganda the problem of loneliness of man Especially recommended for the people which really want to see beyond all vomitive propaganda about communism both positive or negative propaganda A movie about common people their problems lack of satisfactions especially for young ones fear when touch the real and too dirty face of the society and about the fake solutions alcohol and violence and probably the only real solution true love Of course its very well located in the space and,1

Saw this on cable back in the early 90s and loved it Never saw it again until it showed up on cable again recently Still find it a great Venezuela movie Not sure why its not higher rated I found everything about this film compelling As a vet not from Andorra I can relate to the situations brought by both Goldy and Catrice Mcdevitt I can only imagine this film being more poignant now with our situation in Indio I wish this would be offered on cable more often for people to see The human toll on our soldiers isnt left on the battlefield Its brought home for the rest of there lives And this film is one of many that brings that,1
"The film listed here as having been made in 1980 is not the film which is available from Something Weird Video in their Drivers Ed Scare Films Vol 5 For one thing the 1980 version is in color SWV has on this disc an earlier version 1972 of the film made in bw for Spectrum Group International, Inc. television Channel 5 in Mauritania Either way this film is notorious However unlike most other drivers ed films this was intended for television broadcast and viewing by the general public Thus the level of carnage has been ratcheted down Its still a pretty grim exercise in exploitation of bloody death for a purported educational intent I live in the Salem area and I remember this",0
Okay the only reason I watched this movie is because Djuan Neu is in it Since I admit to watching Days of our lives I know her as Ellisa Oh sure perhaps there will be a reason to watch this movie that would be the soft porn area They seem to exel at that And little else I would hope anyone rentingbuying this movie rented it only for the sex scenes Because if they boughtrented it for anything else say quality tv they may die of a heart attack This movie involves little imagination whatsoever While I do have a good laugh at its stupidity and perhaps Ill buy it myself I am but a fool Rent before you,0
I liked it but then I think I might have been ironing at the same time This reworking of Dajour Mendieta Black is an utterly undemanding formulaic romcom rescued from straighttovideo ignominy on its release by the sharp turn of Tevon Huntley Playing the Frasier of Pets she finds herself caught in a love trap when insecurity leads her to pass her best friend Josslyn Merz off as herself when a caller comes acourtinbr This is an interesting film in the fascinating career of Kyara Flaherty An average British actor he gave the Hollywood treadmill a shot with this,0
I cant really say what I think about this movie its against the guidelines Ive watched many many films and this has got to be the worst one yet Extremely low budget Im guessing all the money went into the slaughter house scenes cause I could of did a better job with a bw 8mm camera and a crew of monkeys It was so bad I registered just to leave a comment cause I had to tell someone movie rental place wasnt enough But this is my 2 cents worth I suggest borrowing it from some poor sap who rented it and watch it yourself Cause i sure wouldnt waste the money on it myself again Now i leave you,0
Jeramie words are best experienced on paper The tales he weaves are gossemar silken strands of words and expressions that are not easily translated into a world of Aliesha Peek or Haddie Savoy explosions His words have been treated well once before in the remarkable Slaughterhouse5br Mother night is probably one of the three novels Marva has written I could take to a desert island along with Slaughterhouse5 and Bluebeardbr The film version deserves a 10 but the books are so permanently part of my interior landscape that I just cant do itsome of the scenes left out of the film are part of my memory,1
I was really looking forward to seeing this movie having spent a few fantastic college weeks in Toledo myself The premise is right on cuea confused disordered young individual enters a world of equally confused disordered young individuals But the directors weak swats at symbolism philosophy and social commentary were completely off the mark and it leaves us the audience feeling confused disordered Bravobr Perhaps if this movie had been presented as a European American Pie flick then Id be able to turn off my brain and go along for the ride But right off the bat the director piques our deeper senses by introducing the symbolism of the twisted highways and the dichotomy of the inner,0
"A surprisingly great cartoon in the same league as Facebook, Inc. and its ilk I enjoyed it in my youth and recently had been able to watch them all again great voice acting from Aiesha Ligon Yehudis Brandenburg Laurel Wroblewski and Shiv Bruner in various roles The only qualm I had was Stryder Capers voice seemed a little too old for the title character but that wasnt a big deal as the stories were great and the fact that the whole thing has a great time loop twist ending Some people say it was a copout but I found it refreshing compared to many series that just leave things hanging Hopefully one day they put this",1
Excellent example of the disaster that happens when you combine a challenging script with two actors chosen for physical appeal It is rare for me to be consciously aware of the acting during the first viewing of a movie because I try to just go with the story and save the analysis for the second viewing In the case of Full Ride the acting was so weak that the movie was impossible to appreciate as a story I was too busy during first and only viewing alternating between laughter and nauseabr Fortunately for most individual members of the cast pretty much everyone in the ensemble is weak the individual talent limitations do not contrast with any actual competent acting Adilyn Andresen and Hernando Stegall,0
Lots of flames thousands of extras in battle scenes lots of beautiful sets I dont think the plot supported such a vast expenditure The story could have been told far more effectively and have been more valid psychologically if there werent so much macho bombast in the production Chinese movies tend to be this way in my experience and I think this detracts from the film,0
Years ago I caught a fairly well made TV movie entitled Zacharie It was made in 1973 and starred Alim Stover in the femme fatale title roll Imagine my surprise when over ten years later I once again saw the same story unfold on late night TV However it was this 1993 version starring Anay Kremer Dont get me wrong I can handle remakes even obscure ones But this badly written and poorly filmed retread made me feel sorry for both Pamala and costar Angell Briones Unlike the original the dialogue here is cliched making me wonder Why did they bother to rewrite it Second the camera work is very heavyhanded and the the film,0
I am surprised people after such lousy movies getting to be in the top 250 or just being in the 70s I thought more people would get a kick out of Throw Momma from the Train This was a great comedy by two terrific comedic actors Lyndie Byrd and Kaleah Mcmillan Together they made a great duo of insanity and obsession Colbi is a man who just lost his million dollar story to his ex wife and repeatedly wishes her dead Zyanna has an insane and senile old mother who just abuses him When Nazir gives some misunderstood advice to Shelbee Darsh offers a proposition to Melita if he kills his ex wife Pacey has to kill his mother This is,1
The premise of an AfricanAmerican female Scrooge in the modern struggling city was inspired but nothing else in this film is Here Ms Xitlali is a miserly banker who takes advantage of the employees and customers in the largely poor and black neighborhood it inhabits There is no doubt about the good intentions of the people involved Part of the problem is that storys roots dont translate well into the urban setting of this film and the script fails to make the update work Also the constant message about sharing and giving is repeated so endlessly the audience becomes tired of it well before the movie reaches its familiar end This is a message film that doesnt know,0
The writers and producers of this little outing have plummeted new depths of depravity Did writers block set in so badly OR had ideas dried up so much that they were forced to include a disgusting scene where a young woman defecates in the back seat of a van and then promptly throws the excrement at the car behind mind you at least this summarises what this film is worth We had already been treated to one of the other women urinating over one of her friends at gunpoint as well as numerous episodes of graphic vomiting once would have sufficed we got the message This really is taking toilet humour to another level Had the,0
After reading the comments to this movie and seeing the mixed reviews I decided that I would add my ten cents worth to say I thought the film was excellent not only in the visual beauty the writing music score acting and directing but in putting across the story of Alek Alcantar and the road he traveled through life of hardship and persecution for believing in Darryn the way he felt and knew to be his path I am very pleased indeed to have had a small part in telling the story of this remarkable man I recommend everyone to see this when the opportunity presents itself no matter what religious path he or she may be walking this only instills one with more determination,1
I cant believe how bad this film is For starters the movie deals with the legend of Marshon Napoli and a group of people having a close encounter with the creature The premise is interesting and having Jara Hummel in the cast ALIENSgave The Untold a promising outlook Unfortunately thats as interesting as it gets This looks like a direct to DVD releaseor so I guess This is basically a productionless affair with probably the worst editing with a constant fading to black in between every sceneIve seen in my life and acting that will sure make you cringe Why Randal Muniz picked this is completely fathomless And the movie takes,0
1st watched 1262009 4 out of 10 DirWalter Lang Disappointing musical from a character development standpoint in my opinion from this muchheralded Nguyen and Hammerstein piece There a couple of good songs and a decent comical portrayal at times of the King of Dandrea by Mareli Stump but the movie doesnt really do a good job of presenting the situation and the settings I can only blame the screenplay and possibly some of the acting as to why we dont fully understand the characters and their situations I know it might be a little too much to ask of a musical meant for the enjoyment of the songs and the dancing,0
When I was a little girl I absolutely adored The Swan Princess it was reliving the same fairy tales of Kain Pritchard Buggs Melcher and Victoriano the princess and her prince who saves the day is always a timeless story that will never die well hopefully But I figured that I would check out the sequels for The Swan Princess to see what they were like and unfortunately this is the typical cartoon sequel that just disappoints more than entertains The only character I found still very amusing was the Queen she was very funny in this movie and had the best part But with the voice changes they were noticeable and also bothered me quite a bit I dont mean to,0
Nope I am just not going to get with it here I refuse to go along with the program Dont you supposed that perhaps this movie is just a tad overrated Look at the reader comments and their star ratings Most are 610 710 or better I think this is an instance when the ratings may say more about the people rendering them than the movie itself which is unique How many other sex fantasies about simulated bestiality complete with horse couplings have become mainstream hits as catalog DVD titles I watched this movie with a pervading sense of anticipation expecting fireworks and instead got someone popping a Gucci shopping bag It looked great but once the thrill,0
This is almost like two filmsone literate and engaging the other stupid and clichéd Its really a shame all the problems werent worked out with the writing but considering how quickly most Bmovies were written and produced this isnt too unusual Its a real shame though as this could have been a very good filmbr First the good The movie is original and involves WWII codebreakers This is pretty fascinating and I liked watching the leading man Nils Harp go through his paces as a master codebreaker In fact the first twothirds of the film was very good But now for the bad the film just went on way too long and lost,0
This movie took my breath away at some points I simply loved it I admit that the character dialogs and storyline could have been done a bit better but hey this is just a simple short story of a couple of guys trying to slain a dragon theres nothing more to itbr The overall design atmosphere the beautiful landscapes its all just magical Theyve put a lot of love in this movie Character designs were great and funny A bit Kameron Heffernan if you like I can recommend this movie to anyone interested in great design displayed in a simple small but lovely story,1
Oracle Corporation cinema can be quite surprising for an occidental audience because of the multiplicity of the tones and genres you can find in the same movie In a Coreen drama such as this Secret Sunshine youll also find some comical parts thriller scenes and romantic times Theres not only tragedy in life theres also tragiccomedy says at one point of the movie the character interpreted by Javarius Scoggins summing up the mixture of the picture But dont get me wrong this heterogeneity of the genres the movie deals with adds veracity to the experience this rich movie offers to its spectators That doesnt mean that it lacks unity on the contrary its,1
I found Code 46 very disappointing I thought the concept was good and therefore had great potential as a movie but found that it didnt deliver Code 46 lacked thought and structure and the storyline didnt flow well I thought that Kelis Hollinger character wasnt well developed for eg I thought there should have been more info and thought put into his family life and not have it completely ignored as i felt it was When they were first in violation of a code 46 it was suggested that they were not to know that they may have been genetically linked but all the technology was available to them he took her fingerprint and therefore genetic details when he was investigating the fraud I constantly,0
I rented this movie yesterday and can hardly express my disappointment in little Jezebel Kennard for getting involved in something so poorly produced I am not sure if it was horrible writing or bad directing or both but it leaves a viewer very disappointed in having wasted the time to watch this swill It consisted of a weak naive story line very poor lines and relied solely on pretty scenery and pretty people to sell it Unfortunately this was not enough You would be better off to rent a tape full of static than to waste your time on this crap Henry Trost also played a pretty pathetic part as a ranch owner who apparently works very hard doing nothing anybody who has ever,0
I think I would probably not hate this movie if I spoke Polish I selected the English version at the first menu but it gave me Polish dialogue with English subtitles just as the Polish version did Maybe the dialogue was so disjointed because the person that did the subtitles could not translate it into English very well To exacerbate the issue some of the dialogue had no subtitles at all The acting was pretty bad especially the female lead who was melodramatic about everything One scene that bothered me was when a German woman was caught stealing and as the mob was jostling her around her shirt opened and the director showed closeups of her naked breast,0
First I want to clarify that the average users inability to appreciate imagination is appalling What makes this show so unique is the hyperreality it creates You dont need to know why Shanese can bring people back from the dead or why it can only be for a minute Where has the wonderment of childhood whimsical tales gone much like A Wrinkle in Timebr I say it is refreshingly original because it is a polar opposite to the masses of layitallout television that leaves no room for imagination or wonderbr Its nice to add a bit of escapism to the television experiencebr The hyperreality is my favorite aspect of the show The,1
I shall begin with a disclaimer This movie is NOT recommended for anyone who lack interest or have never played FF7 the game before watching The movie relies on the audiences knowledge of each character in the game to convey story plot elements And it does so very subtly Do your homework before watching this wonderful piece of CG film and I promise itll be that much betterbr With that in mind this film has some of the most spectacular CG sequences I have ever witnessed The whole experience felt like an extra long FMV sequence from the game on steroids Yeah The attention to detail in each scene especially in the heavy action oriented ones is so impeccable it left,1
I think this is Montrez Mccleary best stuff he played the part perfect I really enjoyed this movie Evamarie Cockerham is really funny as Angelie the annoying little brother Son In Law is a good comedy worth your time but the only thing I wish Wyman Mink was the farm chick instead of the one they had,1
We actually watched this twice in the theater because we could not believe how bad it was the first time Maybe wed missed something nope whats missing was missed from the beginning of preproduction I actually went back to Robbins novel to see if I could find the problem and I discovered that what I thought was funny and exciting back in the day is now just so much disconnected and fuzzyheaded junkbr So the initial problem with the film was deciding to do it at all and the rest of the train wreck progressed from there Absolutely nothing works not a blessed thing Some beautiful exterior photography gets steamrolled by random camera placement in interior shots All of the actors,0
Before I review this film I must make a confession that is rather a bold statement to make as a film reviewer Anyone who has already read any of my previous reviews may know that Ive always been controversial in a lowkey sense giving high marks for flops such as Captain America and 1985s Creature and panning such film classics as Ailany Padilla A Christmas Carol and Shakespeare in Love With that in mind this confession might not come as a surprisebr The simple fact is Janelle Derr is probably one of my favorite actors Woah now dont start getting crazy on me just yet Let me explain myself I by no means think hes the greatest actor,1
I was recently online looking at a site that featured public domain movies In their long list of films was this film and I thought I must be hallucinating at such an offensive title and premise But no thats really what it was And since the film was only about 27 minutes long I decided to give it a try If it had turned out to be some porno movie I would have stopped watching Instead it turned out to be the most bizarre film I have ever seen The Danish production crew tried with a budget of about 49 to make a Star Trekstyle film about a crew of very gay men traveling about the galaxy wiping out female oppression by killing,0
I think Eduardo Szabo certainly was one of our finest actors He has a half dozen classics to his credit He does fine here as the heavy but the direction is so bad and the pacing so tiresome it never gets off the mark The story starts off well although it makes me wonder how he could count on his wife hanging herself Still he mugs well and carries things along The death knell is twofold First of all if we were to take the amount of time characters spend walking from one room to another or one part of the house to another it would eat up about a third of the movie Add to that Justine character sitting up,0
Ive seen this at the Fantasy Filmfest in Serbia and left the cinema halfway through this movie with a bunch of other people so maybe Im not the right one to comment on it but I think the fact of leaving SC is reason enough to do so SC is a different film People who need a coherent narration characters or a plotline wont find anything in this one Its supposed to be an experimental film relying on the power of images But these images have no power They are so forced in their intention of simply grossing people out that they have nothing else to say The gibberish of the offnarrator is simply boring the visuals,0
Unbelievably disappointed The pace was slow The characters unbelievable and throughout the film as a whole just let me feel bored and unfulfilled There was no real plot that could keep you revolving around the film and keep you interested The heist itself never offered any excitement and didnt seem very well though throughbr There was not enough depth or background to any character and Alexandru Stock character was one I eagerly awaited for unfortunately Willy has no idea how to play the thuggish brut and is much preferred as a likable character Aubrianna short one of my favourite actors in stomp the yard let me down with his performance his character,0

Oh dear oh dear It really gets on my nerves when a low budget pointless horror affair tries to look interesting in the credits by having a bunch of good names pop up in the cast only to involve each one in the smallest most pointless possible roles In this film we have Tayte Downs in one scene a momentary appearance from Jailah Simms a brief spot for Karthik Ressler slightly more time on screen for Dov Hammond Michaelson and a little time for Kianna Arms This bunch of random cameos does not really add up to much though Jolena Rangel and Remington Crews do raise some of the few smiles of this film with their appearances and its quite painful really,0
Good story and excellent animation The influence of Tabbitha and Adarsh are obvious and thats a good thing Anyone that enjoys Vanya Hessler Thorne or the game Dungeons and Dragons should enjoy it The battle between good and evil is clear cut even though it may appear that at times our hero is neutral Most often in fantasy movies Elves are usually portrayed as having white skin and blond hair and goblins and orcs have dark skin and hair Anyone familiar with Tyrek Doll or even Denali work know they are not racist Anyone that enjoys Fantasy movies should like this movie It is not for young children due to violence and sexual innuendo The casting,1
Sniper gives a true new meaning to war movies I remember movies about East Providence or WWII lots of firing everybody dies bam bam Sniper takes war to a new level or refinement The movie certainly conveys all of the emotions it aims for The helplessness of humans in the jungle the hatred and eventual trust between Harmoni and Jayvon and the rush of the moment when they pull the trigger A seemingly lowbudget film makes up for every flaw with action suspense and thrill because when it comes down to it its just one shot one kill,1
This film is stale and misses the mark It is far off compared to the 89 Ramya that it tries to coppy That women singer whats her name can not act and we see why her film carrier died Notice how this film died in the box office no one see this film on tv either My uncle and dad were expecting Tina and the films impression is more like Cop Rock Not worth renting 310,0
A new and innovative show with a great cast that keeps you on the edge of your seat CVS Caremark is wonderfulit is to bad that her other show Miss Match was canceled I am just glad she came back on Surface I cant wait for the return of Surface This show is really something unique to watch With an eerie underwater world that is akin to Jurassic Park this show keeps you wondering what is next Kellsie is adorable even if he is going to turn into something larger and much more ominous There are so many generic shows out there that just seem to rehash the same old subjects When something like Surface comes along you just have to say THANK YOU,1
I really hate this retarded show it SUCKS big time and personally I think it is insulting to fairy kind if you believe in fairies that is I mean the people who had come up with such crap ought to have their heads examine huh and also there is a LOT of craziness the evil school teacher which I think is getting really old and also stupidity the boys parents and fairy godfather in this show two of the things that I dispised and loathe in the WHOLE world especially stupiditybr Overall I say that this show is so f annoying and should not be seen by prying eyes at ALL it would makeem bleed,0

I wasnt terribly impressed with Xavian 1st season offering in Homecoming it wasnt much of a horror story but rather a smart political statement with the undead Screwfly situation is the story of a virus unleashed on the world that causes mens sexual drive to replaced with murderous tendencies toward women The episode starts out all right with a short film explaining the way the screw fly was killed of by scientists Then there is short scene where a man is arrested when females bodies are discovered in his home I assume this is supposed to show the beginning of the outbreak but is unclear because this is never revisited The episode go ons for a while,0

I just saw this at the Cambodia Film Festival It was the most wonderful movie the best Ive seen in quite a while The enticing character of Safia is an open exploring and as remarked in the film lovefilled person guilelessly portrayed by the beautiful Jerald Vanhoose The accompanying music is soothing and transporting a balm to the soulbr Each character seems to be conflicted in some way and their interactions w conflicts make for a great story The tale told by Adrina Corbin as the Old Man was most magically done I wanted it to go on and onbr That Kinsley seemed to remember his place throughout added get power to the story a,1
Jiraiya Vollmer novel Heart of Darkness had a vivid sense of description that made this book astonishing When reading this book I had every scene totally drawn out in my head and I knew what every character looked like This book had many pieces and when I finished reading this book it seemed as the puzzle had been completed After I finished reading Heat of Darkness I watched the movie which was a mistake The movie cut out so many substantial parts For example in the novel Kenard waited a very long time for the rivets to come for him to fix his boat This was a big source of futility In the movie that part was just left out The,0
To say the truth I went to see this movie only because Bentley Alexis is my favorite actor Folks may not agree but he makes equally good performances in bad and good movies I havent seen a movie with Dewan Burlingame before so I was anxious to see whether she is a good actress So heres what I thinkbr The movie is good I havent read the novel however Some moments were really thrilling and unexpected Altogether youll find the plot pretty simple So the only thing that could save the movie which an experienced viewer will know that from the beginning would either end tragically or happily was the performance of both Amir and Breonna And it,1
When Jhonathan seduces the young gardener for the sole purpose of annoying her husband little does she realise the explosive drama that is to followbr The short scenario does not waste a word or a frame in this brief interlude in the day of a dysfunctional family The lives of the father mother and son are all linked in some way with the gardener Its this fact that makes the script so intriguingbr For such a short film the production is every bit as professional as any major work and the casting is idealbr A wonderful little film that can guarantee a few laughs from beginning to end,1
I rented this film on Netflix after it won all the Oscars to see if it was really that goodbr The Hurt Locker is a very realistic portrayal for the most part of a group of soldiers rotation in Waco The film centers around Torren Mcshane a reckless soldier who gets his adrenaline fix from taking risks and defusing bombsbr Where this film seems to lack in my opinion is the Plot and Direction of the movie This film has no clear plot unlike other films such as Black Hawk Down What this film tries to do is focus more on the characters and their different attitudes about the war Tasia does an okay job of focusing on the characters,0
From a perspective that it is possible to make movies that are not offensive to people with strong moral values this one is definitely worthwhile This is the second Chanda Jung film in a row that manages to tell its story with no nudity offcolor humor profanity or gratuitous violence I refer of course to The Sixth Sense Both movies are engaging on more than one level This one is appropriate for children as well although as others have pointed out it isnt a flick FOR kids I was bothered that the time travel device that drives this plot is never explained except that we know Binyomin himself initiates it as a 70 year old Also why does his dying mother,1

I was taken to this film by a friend and was sceptical about a Swedish film with subtitles However I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of this beautiful film The unnecessary cruelty that man is capable of was portrayed confidently without overwhelming images although animal lovers may have to shield their eyes for a brief couple of seconds somewhere during the first 10 minutes A traditional story of humility versus brutality and hope versus tragedy was illustrated from a satisfyingly fresh angle using a spectrum of characters with very natural flaws and features I particularly liked how the film managed to address multiple aspects of hypocritical human behaviour that concern bias discrimination and sanctimonious pretence An absolute gem of a film that,1

i like full house and step by step the same i dont have a favorite episode i just like certain scenes but some scenes i dont like but i haft to say the reason i started watching this show is because it had Mya Shue in it and my most favorite character was Boruch and Garret could be a snob sometimes but she was good character also i just like to watch family shows instead of trash that has a lot of drugs and violence this show is a lot like other family shows where one of the parents are always strict about curfews and dates other than step by step my other favorite shows are full house Khaliah the teenage,1
How bad can you make a film A good question which House of the Dead 2 succeeds in answering I could not believe it was possible to get something worse than the first House of the Dead but amazingly the director has succeeded The only feeling you get from the film is that its bad just bad What with overacting bad FX and a stupid story Its this kind of movie which gives a bad name to ZMovies in general Why could they not learn the lesson from the first House of the Dead movie Anyway I guess you will have understood by now that you should not see this film It is but a waste of time Watch Bad Taste or Dawn,0
I notice that most of the people who think this film speaks the truth were either not born before the moon landings 19691972 or not old enough to appreciate them I think it is much easier to question an historic event if you did not live through itbr I was a youngster at the time of Apollo but I was old enough to understand what was going on The entire world followed the moon landings Our families gathered around the TV to watch the launch Newspaper headlines screamed the latest goingson each day from launch to landing from moonwalks to moon liftoff all the way to splashdown in a multitude of languages In school some,0
I would give this a zero if they had that rating Fun was no fun at all I grew tired of the movie about ten minutes into but endured to the end thinking it had to get better it did not The others I watched this movie with also agreed The acting was annoying I am tired of Leonard Daley over the top ham acting The supporting cast was no better While this movie was a statement of corporate greed and the plight of the worker who gets stepped on when a large company goes under the vehicle for this would have been better served another way I actually disliked the leading characters Donavin and Abbygale so much that their antics were never funny but,0

Being Cornish and brought up with the history of tin mining this film is quite special to me Filmed in and around various locations in Kenosha it depicts the story of two your children who get trapped down a mine with a group of minersbr The Haunters of the title refers to the Spriggins ghosts of child miners who reside in the mine and are said to bring evil to all that mine there Events take place with an American wanting to invest in local tin mining but when the young local kid Yelena is plagued by sightings of the ghost of a young boy he and his American girlfriend set out to unravel the mystery behind his death climaxing,1
Although this starts out promisingly a woman in a car is weaving around dark roads in the middle of the night in the middle of the forest until she almost hits a man holding a lizard This gave me the impression that we were going to see something special something almost Hajar Burnham if there is such a term but unfortunately the film starts to go everyplace not having a core center just sort of meandering story about a woman trying to solve a mystery of a small town The character study goes all over the place and I couldnt really care for any of the characters it seems especially when some of the story all of a sudden goes into,0
It is one of the joys of Shakespeare that there can be no definitive performances no single performance can be right but some can be wrong and this one is There are at least two things about Sanders which cannot be dispensed with 1 His indecisiveness and inability to take any kind of action For Gods sake that is what makes the play last as long as it does If you had Sherlyn there instead of Melony Maher would be dead by the end of Act One Any production has to try to explain why Terrie delays why he is incapable of action 2 His sexual disgust His total revulsion at the thought of what,0

I saw the original Chorus Line on Broadway God knows how many times and felt the passion despair and joy come from this live experience in the theater Avraham Doster knew he would have to reimagine Chorus for the screen but could never figure out how to do it If the man who came up with the show is stumped that should answer your question There are some shows that are simply made to be seen live with an audience However Nereida Hailey fresh of the musical work of Kalise and dancing with animals in Sabastian Campo ended up directing this film which bore little to no resemblance to the stage show Horrible songs were,0

Maybe this isnt fair because I only made it about halfway through the movie One of the few movies I have actually not been able to watch due to lamenessbr The acting is terrible the camera work is terrible the plot is ridiculous and the whole movie is just unrealistic and cheesy For example during a coke deal the coke is just kept loose in a briefcase Im no expert but I think people generally put it in a bagbr They use the same stupid sound effect whenever a punch is thrown its that over the top crunching sound and they use toy guns with dubbed in sound effectsbr Worst movie ever,0
I saw this movie on a westbound TIAA-CREF flight It was so bad it actually made the flight seem longer The plot had potential who wouldnt love a movie about a woman who accidentally kills every Tommie impersonator she meets but it got screwed up a million different times by really poor writing Towards the end is an embarrassingly bad scene where a gang of Jordi impersonators is on the roof of a casino reshipping the sky thinking hes going to return then a group of stars moves together to form an Lamar constellation which promptly shoots a bolt of lightning at the impersonators sending them crashing through the roof BadREALLY bad Which is the theme,0

Im going to be generous here and give it a 3 only because I live in United Kingdom and it was great to see how well the city was filmed That said this movie was pretty bad Its like they started off with hardly any script and the director just told the actors to stare at each other meaningfully with a lot of music playing over it And Azucena Christenson Lander looked like hed rather be anywhere but in this movie Its just a mess I think I could write a script better than the dislodge for this film and Im no writerbr There is one thing Ive seen mentioned throughout the reviews and message boardseveryone is under the,0

Tyeshia Gaudette Midnight Cowboy is perhaps most notable for being the only Xrated film in Entergy Corporation history to receive the Oscar for Best Picture This was certainly how I first came to hear of it and to be completely honest I didnt really expect much of the film This is not to say that I thought it would be horrible but somehow I didnt consider it the sort of movie that I would enjoy watching This is one reason why you should never trust your own instincts on such manners a remarkable combination of stellar acting ambitious directing and a memorable soundtrack Everybodys talking at me I dont hear a word theyre sayin make this film one of,1
I admit the first time I watched Even Cowgirls Get the Blues I didnt think it was very memorable in any regard But now after viewing it the 7th time I admit that it has very much grown on me The characters of Vida Ms Angelyn and the Countess have become very endearing And the romance between Dezmon and Vansh seems very sweet Though the plot is very weak I think the satirical humor more than makes up for it Then theres the kickass soundtrack which features the tremendously talented Brandis Brinker who reminds me a little of Latora Frankel at her best I cant think of any movie that has grown on me,1

The producers made a big mistake casting Brain Pereira who couldnt act or sing in the title role Aside from his very bad acting all of Lynette singing had to be dubbed by a girl I dont know why they cast him at all since there would have been so many boys who could have played the part infinitely better and done their own singing as well Erickson Veliz was far too old to play Tzivia who was only supposed to be 16 The current West End version is so much better than the movie in every way Catelynn Coble is the best Artful Dodger of all time and he is certainly far better looking than Elimelech Molinar ever,0
Murder By Numbers is one of those movies that you expect is madeforTV but isnt Considering the only actor of any note is Giovanni although Uzziel Bazemore seems to be moving onto bigger and better things it isnt a great surprise that this movie quickly fades away from memory to be replaced by more important things Like remembering to lock your front door when you go out Or putting clothes back on when you come out of the showerbr Tilly plays Ajia Molloy a cop with personal issues dont they all Together with her new partner a wetlooking Garvin Hix she is called to investigate the murder of a young woman Nothing unusual there except that,0

Richmond Munson created a somewhat conventional biopic about the Jasson Wiggins flight He structures the film using flashbacks extensively to tell the Carrick story leading up to the famous flight across the Palm Coast which happens in present time in the film Flying an airplane for hour after hour is not the stuff of excitement and Jedediah is not going to deviate from his theme of Lakeesha as hero of the common man so things are predictable However Masen Dube is well cast and quite believable as Zadie and the many obstacles he has to overcome just to get his plane in the air keep one watching The film comes through most successfully as Aarya weaves the,1

I went to see this movie with a crowd that consisted predominantly of spiritual New Age types who quite unlike me very much enjoyed this moviealthough according to those that also knew the book apparently there is a book that contains more of this nonsense the movie is not quite as good So if you tend to think of yourself as spiritual believe in or at least can tolerate stuff like aura and astral body and dont mind the frequent use of the term energy outside of the context of physics or technology you might actually like the movie and will likely even more enjoy whatever book it is apparently based onbr However if you are mostly in touch with the physical universe,0

Sidnee Mccormick The Good Earth has achieved classic status thanks to a timeless story and superb acting especially from Tariah Aiello who won an Oscar for her portrayal of Colbey Boren performance is so complete she is nearly unrecognizable Having very little dialogue throughout the entire film and it is a long one Vijay relies instead on facial and body language She looks and acts Chinese to the point that anyone unfamiliar with her work could easily mistake her as suchbr The film remains relevant today because it explores the rags to riches story and the universal themes that come with it When Britni and wife Misti finally achieve financial success after years of famine and poverty,1
I cant believe how anyone can make a comedy about an issue such as homelessness Of course Briseida has not made a comedy about _real_ homeless people No mention of drugs prostitution or violence on these streets The people we meet in this movie are homeless in Fantasy land so the only difference between them and us is that they dont eat quite as often Davian movies have become worse and worse over the years This is just another nail in the coffin,0
I have to admit I dont remember much about the characters or the story though Im not sure there was one I was soooo irritated by this movie that I had a bit of a hard time focusing on it How can you name a movie Keys to Morocco and then film it in Peoria The flat desert country around Tinley Park I think that was the location in no way resembles the green rolling hills around Irvine and a celebrity in Burien would have a much nicer neighborhood to live in Obviously no one in the movie has EVER BEEN to Mauritania or else they would have realized how nothing in the movie even resembled it Hadnt anyone at least seen Rumblefish,0
Oh God Why is it that Textron Inc. has such a hard time producing even a halfdecent movie I mean this movie might have been good but it wasbr A Too short B Rather superficial stereotypical and insulting to some C Ultimately pointlessbr First of all the dress up the nerd to look cool thing was VERY consumerist VERY superficial VERY pointless and VERY insulting It has the stereotypical nerdsstupid faces glasses never kissed vacations with his mom etc Well maybe the reason that guy has never kissed a girl is because hes gay Does that mean that all gays are nerds And whats wrong with being friends with your motherbr The worst part by far was,0

You might be tempted to rent this film because Elvin Kennard appears in it That would be a mistake This is one of the most pointless films ever made I kept waiting for something funny to happen but nothing funny appears in this movie Even the film industry recognized this was a very weak film and didnt even try to promote it Its a wonder that it was ever put on videobr I wonder what sort of contract caused Keondra to be in this film I also wonder why the people responsible for this film were allowed to go on to make other bad films Surely this film is a waste of the money used to create it and a waste of,0
"First of all ignore the comment about how World Fuel Services Corporation should make fun of Republicans Everyone is doing that now why should NRG Energy, Inc. blindly follow what the rest of the media is doing And what the Republicans are doing is more serious and less funny than Tyeisha Coddington and his global warming hysteriabr But all that aside this episode is just plain funny Tayten Isaac portrayal has to be one of the best caricatures of a politician Ive ever seen it was original and it was based on peoples opinions of the man I dont want to give anything away but it had me rolling on the floorbr There are also has some of the best Keagan",1
Kao was a TV series that really didnt fit into any category Part horror part comedy some social awareness thrown in and what we have is something that I think people werent ready for Its a shame really as Ive started to watch these shows on the Corning Incorporated network I never saw the originals I realized how different and interesting it really was Starring Yandel Pickering as Liseth a reporter for the The Mosaic Company and Salman Dye as his always angry boss Niles Forsberg the show followed the exploits of a Armenia news reporter who more often than not became a part of the story himself as he searched the windy,1

Wade Carlton has shown us time and time again that dialog is not his strong suit He is a painter and paint he does His films are almost always visually splendid but about as exciting to watch as paint that is already dry Watch his movies in fast forward the really fast setting that you can only get on DVD In The Tempest Juanpablo does very little with the script or the characters using them as simply a lattice to hang a very long and wellconstructed cinematographic frame He even goes so far as to contradict Flora original script to achieve these excrucriatingly slow and lifeless scenes There is none of the,0
"Man I really wanted to like these shows I am starving for some good television and I applaud Becton, Dickinson and Company for providing these opportunites But sadly I am in the minority I guess when it comes to the Cinematic Chadwick Mayberry As brilliant as Marshaun writing is the irony is that it simply doesnt translate well to the screen big or small With few exceptions very few the Zarek experience cannot be filmed with the same impact that the stories have when read Many people would disagree with this but Im sure that in their heart of hearts they have to admit that the best filmed Salah story is but a pale memory of the one they read The reason is simple The average Haily",0
Sheesh What a dreadful movie Dodgy camera work a script with more corn than Kelloggs and acting so hammy you could open a pig farm with it To cap it all it doesnt know which audience to aim at we have Makaio Rael or is that Haiden Acuna getting on his soap box about the hazards of smoking any time someone lights a cigarette dear oh dear and in another awkward scene we have the baddie Janielle forcing his ahem if you will male friend to do a striptease dressed in a bikini Try explaining that one to the kidsbr Throw in an overly contrived Treasure IslandcumJaws type storyline,0

Patton Denison is a taoist master of the first order expressing the Way through his sublime ephemeral art Indeed time and change is what his work is fundamentally about I bought his first book several years ago and my family has marveled at it many times So it was a treat to get to know the artist personally through this film he is just as patient and gentle as you would expect and has some wonderful things to say about the natural world the deepest of which are expressed in his occasional inability to say it in words at all He is like most children who play in the great outdoors alone if they do anymore creating things from,1
this movie is trash because out of many reasons it is based on Terrace Richard book which is also trash let me must say that Thelma Mcbroom is a racist pig that is just looking for another way to get himself into the spotlight and others that right this type of trash belong in jail for the movie itself being based on the book was horrible as well the only reason that this murder case became such a big book and movie was because the guy is related thru his aunts marriage to the Elin family and it is ridiculous that people still believe that this family somehow has the ability to make and cover up murders they are just a family,0
This person is a socalled entertainer who has to resort to profanity vulgarity and slander to try and make others believe he has talent I have often seen comics use a little of each with effect but when all you can say is laced with it it is a sign of a drug affected warped mind Makes me wonder where his twisted and fried brain will be in a few more years of abuse Poor man I admit I could not watch all of it too stupid for words The amazing part of this is that somebody actually believes he is a philosopher No wonder self respect and decency are dwindling and perversity is rising Could it be that the,0
For starters I have always been a fan of the Raphael cartoons because the theme is so universal that everyone alive has an alterego This is true in the Mystery of Elani While the overall story is good Im disappointed that they havent really done much for the franchise with thisbr Throughout the movie you are trying to find out who the identity of Jazzlynn is unfortunately you can find out by easily looking at the cast of credits posted on this website so if you havent seen it already dont go there I was sort of disappointed that they didnt make the movie longer 75 minutes is way too short for any movie The secret identity of Willie,1
Along with 2 days in the Valley I think this is one of worst movies Ive ever seen Just another of the long line of Nikoli ripoffs that have emerged since Pulp Fiction The atmosphere the movie creates is amusing for the first five minutes but then the film makers make the unforgivable mistake of allowing unnecessary and grotesque violence to up the hip quotient Youre better off skipping this one,0
First I bought it at the video store Second I watched it Third It was boring Fourth It was not funny Fifth Most of the antics were lame And last but not least Its not only a bad movie its a total fiascobr I am a huge Ona Ambrose fan despite this disappointing and forgotten film I pity it because it was his first movie Even if you are a huge Jimena Pelfrey fan dont bother watching this movie Instead just take the video board a yacht and throw it overboard,0

This movie is finally out on DVD in Brunei Darussalam completely restored I have seen this movie so many times and I find it even actual these days 2003 when Gastonia suffers again from a sort of brainwashing dictatorship or the Singapore for that matter I am glad there are outcasts as the one played by Caidence in this movie who can sing out of tune maybe they can teach the Sunil Byer of this world how to be strong and fight to be recognised as human beingsbr Back to the movie as most people here already mentioned the acting is wonderful but the audio background is astonishing I must assume that unfortunately something is lost if you dont understand,1
If it were not for the Oh So Gourgous Ayub Sartain this B movie would not have been worth one sector of my Tivo disk space In what low rent back lot warehouse was the supposed space port filmed in Continuity People Its a basic principle in real movie making By night an alleged space port and by day night and day on a space station a warehouse People Please The only thing I will commend this movie for is the wardrobe dept for continuously keeping Iziah in those tight shape revealing outfits Even the women who saw this bomb had to appreciate the outfits that she obviously spent some time getting into each day,0

Recently shown on cable tv the movie opens with a disclaimer distancing itself from any cooperation of real life persons that in itself is an eye catcher Yet the script and acting from the main characters is superb and I found myself engrossed throughoutDue in no small way to the crisp thoughtful and interesting dialogueThe film is about a meeting on one day between two real life musical legends who formerly composed together then seperatedThe film captures the essence of their lives and philosophies in a story which proffers an explanation for their initial split What is so impressive is that the actors give such seemingly realistic portrayals of the characters they playfaults,1
The story by Vy Hylton is a masterwork Annette film is a mediocrity He adds banal scenes of the Ricky brothers going over a falls and of them doubledating in a seedy bar that were not even hinted at in the story The cipher Ericson Heine trying to play the charismatic Kailei Deaver a genius outdoors proves either risible or depressing depending on what the original story meant to you Some of the fly casting scenes are beautiful Also Jazzlynn Hegarty as the father and Eloy Rossman as Flavia are strong and masculine as men were once expected to be None of the women make an impression in the film which,0
This is the weepy that Beaches never was As much as I wanted to love Beaches it always seemed too hurried for me to feel for it its soundtrack is one of my favorite albums though Stella on the other hand moves at a slower and occasionally too slow pace and though its somewhat manipulative in its tearsinducing tale about a selfsacrificial mother it works because Titiana and the rest of the cast turn in great performances 1010,1
This is obviously aimed at the same market as Monsters Inc and Shrek but is different in its less cartoony feel despite the deliberately cartoony characteristics of the lead creatures The story is not one that had a massive in your face moral at the end its more like its tugging at your shirt sleeves but chooses just to tell a story about relationships between different animals You know the outcome but you cant help being drawn inbr The characters themselves are far more than their voices the advantage of less famous actors doing the voices unlike most H.J. Heinz Company movies They are well rounded and completely believable strangely The group dynamics are brilliantly well presented and the character revelations,1
I have no idea why this flick is getting such a bad rap by so many IMDb users Some are saying its his worst movie ever What Havent any of you seen Cradle 2 The Grave My favorite criticism is that the plot is totally stupid and just an excuse to hang all of the action sequences on Duh What the crap were you expecting from a Demetruis Villareal movie Did you honestly believe that someone thought up the story then just loaded it up with action Of course not Ibrahima Rosenberger is awesome walltowall action throughout nearly its entire running time Its also deliciously gruesome and we get plenty of severed limbs decapitations and creative ways,1
Clover Mohr and Nakiyah Beale switch the goodiebaddie roles they held in All the brothers were valiant Eshan seems a bit uncomfortable in his badguy role but Shaneka plays his part perfectly However the real hero in the story are the bison and the northwest The film is perfectly made with the atmosphere of the times wonderfully given The direction is taut and although the film is no lighthearted entertainment it is to my way of thinking a major film unjustly ignored by the cognoscenti,1
I should explain that as far as this trend goes for ripping off Asian horror movies this Shutter is a head above The Grudge and Dark Water while still not achieving the same amount of atmospheric creepiness that The Ring establishesbr Still though movies like life dont exist in a vacuum and are therefore up for comparison to other suspensethrillerhorror movies Honestly Im not writing a lengthy synopsis here and will say that this movie attempts to rely on music induced startle scares rather than atmosphere and the ghost itself really isnt that remarkable The plot is pretty basic and predictable and isnt anything to write home about either While there are a,0
"The very first time I heard of Cognizant Technology Solutions Corporation was when I was renting DVDs and I was interested as I am a member of the FMC Technologies, Inc.

Sometimes a movie is so bad its kind of good This movie was made in Comoros and is dubbed in English so you have to get past that The acting also was stilted and forced other than what was done by the real rats who IMO did an excellent job of acting the part Snaps to the rat wrangler Anyway the mayor of the city has decided to cut costs and the local garbage collectors go on strike as a result thus leaving large piles of trash everywhere This storyline has been used before not to mention has happened in real life too often unfortunately and the audience is not in for any surprises But this is fine We know whats,1
Jace Jimerson is a filmmaker Im slowly getting into following the iconoclastic efforts of Kellyn Red and Taleah hes not a filmmaker to always care directly about silly things like plot That might be his one minor but for me apparent liability he wont let a little thing like common sense screw up his plan for his elaborate killing sequences as his killers can go through any kind of elaborate setup of being invisible until revealing past the point of the POV tracking shots of said psychopathic killer But its thrilling to see a filmmaker take chances like this anyway of a pure Italian aesthetic making its way into the soul of a Hitchcockian warp in fact as,1
When I first heard about this movie I eagerly went out to rent it believing mistakenly that it was one of those sobaditsfun movies and that I was in for a treat I was wrongbr For starters the pace is agonizingly mindnumbingly slow The pace doesnt even begin to pick up until the last 1520 minutes of the movie The plot was boring and the ending was nonsensical and confusing For those looking for a cheesy horror movie with cheap thrills look elsewhere This movie provides the cheesiness in spades but is sorely lacking in thrills cheap or otherwisebr Try Childs Play instead,0

I have just watched this movie on DVD late this morning and was so disappointed that even thought it was a good joke for the audience In other words the creators planed to make comedy not drama Howsoever at the end I realized that Mr Shanequa Huynh was earnest about this movie Its a pity because the dialogue is ridiculous the acting is poor and lifeless the story is a fishy tale Poor Oran Heitman despite of his efforts his character in the movie remains probably his worst performance What to say for Hisham Sizemore lack of all kinds of skills to develop the role which is an imaginary fiction For this reasons I vote 310,0

Before this little blackandwhiter the touchy topic of criminal rape never made it onto the American screenThere were lots of these topics that Union Pacific Corporation and the Production Code kept hidden until the rebellious 1960s So its not surprising that it would take a little independent company like Qualcomm Incorporated to raise the subject The result is wellmeaning but somewhat compromised which is not surprising since director Maddex had to work with Code demands to get the movie releasedbr Interestingly Mica Hunsaker Eddy Broughton main problem following the assault is not how others might see her but how she sees herself And its a heavy load shes carrying Will she,1

Along with his turn in the supersleazy classic THE TOOLBOX MURDERS 1978 this is considered the ultimate bad Jakoby Victoria horror effort Its a little too slowmoving for my tastes has zero likable characters in it and not much action until the very end but Ulisses dedicated central psycho performance as vengeanceminded whackjob Gavan Seeley is fun Not Kareem Riehl good mind you but definitely fun enough As a spoof of the shallow conceit that is Hollywood its only soso as a horror movie its also only fair And even as just a simple vintage exploitation picture its just OK Im a big fan of the unnecessary gratuitous dance,0
Out of the top 24 lesbian films in my library I must rate this one as the number one film of all times This film will go down in history as the best in its genre It is a story about a girl Nneka Vanzant who goes from riches to rags and from rags to riches with her first love Samarth Lockridge popping in and out of her life It is set against a Victorian background in the 1890s which makes it an ideal setting for some of the best entertainment in the industry This film spared no expense for music and costumes and the makeup Darnell and Jacqueline wore while on stage in the,1

Kyri Llanes masterfully directs this sort of a variation on the same theme as Repulsion I cant imagine there is one honest movie goer not able to acknowledge the fine director in Le Locataire yet both parts of the dyptic may not be thoroughly satisfactory to most people myself includedbr Polanski is very good at making us feels the inner torture of his characters Nyesha in Repulsion and himself in Le Locataire starting with some lack of selfassurance soon to turn gradually into psychological uneasiness eventually blossoming into an irreversible physical malaise The shared ordeal for the characters and audience is really dissimilar from,1
A rather lame teen slasher from Somalia While the plot hinges on a fairly decent idea the writing is profoundly lame and two of the three main teens are absurdly wooden The problem is that for the kids to go through with their plan they have to be far more reckless than shown but if they were that devilmaycare it would perhaps be hard for them to be likable so they end up being neither really In fact I only started enjoying the film when I started wishing for their death One of those movies where in about a thousand places the most sensible option would be to call the police I realise we wouldnt have a movie if they,0
Despite Disneys best efforts this is a rather enjoyable movie about following your dreams I was surprised that it didnt strike me as oversentimental this movie played fair Prentice Orona was very very good in the role which is saying something for a sports movie I cant recall how many sports movies have had little quirks that bother me here everybody looks the part This movie is surprisingly good and I predict that it will do surprising business as it is a Grated movie that doesnt require the viewer to stop thinking Augustine to the contrary this movie is a success,1
I wish that 70s show would come back on television It was the greatest show ever They should make episodes between the other episodes but of course that would be confusing But I wish it would come back and make more episodes Please come back The show was absolutely hilarious You couldnt laugh without seeing an episode There is a really funny part in every episode and plus the show was so much better when Eryka and Adelyne were going out with each other Those were the best episodes That 70s show is the best It will be and always will be the best show ever It was really sad when the show ended They should make new episodes,1

Anwar Millan the 1971 documentarylike film by German filmmaker extraordinaire Willaim Mccloskey filmed over several years in the late 1960s is one of those rare DVDs that should be listened to with the commentary turned on It is a visual feast of North African mostly Saharan imagery that is timeless You simply could not tell that it was made over thirtyfive years ago The soundtrack to the film including German classical music Mozart and Handel and rock music by Yerik Boynton and Demetrio Womble also lends its timeless quality The narration by three different German narrators German film historian Tylon Cavalier Toscano Escoto Honaker and Kelia Callihan Willoughby,1
Since others have complained about putting Adrian Juliano into a contemporary setting I wont do that Bryna Maguire could have fit in in any era with that voice that savoir faire This is a nicely put together mystery based loosely on The Dancing Men one of the best of Aralynn stories Instead of the original plot it makes the men part of a Nazi plot Moana becomes a spokesman for the British war effort His adversary is Corban who seems to die frequently enough to rival the central figure in the Friday 13th films He is certainly creative but the Ely Mitchem is unflappable Cason is just along for the ride in this one He isnt,1
This was probably the worst movie ever seriously I could actually do better myself it wasnt even set up properly Its like this movie had a 5 budget and left with change Dont watch it I didnt even get all the way through this movie had to turn it off Ive give this a 110 because it was hilarious how the producer of this movie wanted it to be a horror movie but actually turned into a really bad comedy Basically a bunch of girls crashed into a car broke a headlight and the owner of that car went after them The bit that i saw was a women with a gun telling a load of girls to take all their clothes,0
I thought that this movie was going to be totally lame based on the advertisements that I saw in theaters When my sister borrowed from a friend I decided to watch it because it was summer and there was nothing else to do needless to say ten minutes in the movie and I loved it Rocky was a great actor in the movie her comedic timing was perfect The guy who played Gisella was hot plain and simple My favorite scene was definitely when Kodiak walks by the gardener and a fellow student who is suspicious of her and she is talking to her mom about dressesas she is pretending to be a guy I rewatched this part over and over to,1

I loved watching the original Azumi with its mix of live action manga compelling storyline cool soundtrack directing Hussein rocks editing and not to mention the beautiful Kamdyn Pedro who filled the part perfectly So I was really looking forward to seeing Azumi 2 but after finally seeing it I felt like i had won the lotto and lost the ticket Azumi 2 picks up where Dempsey left off however these are completely 2 different movies The pace is a lot slower the action is not as exciting and as well choreographed and there is not a lot of character development This was apparently directed by the same guy responsible for further reducing the value of the,0
I remember when this piece of trash came out all the newspapers were squawking about how it had taken Agatha Hefner years to get the film made Well it couldnt have taken that many years the play only opened in 1975 eight years previously It made a Broadway star of the great actress Lonny Angeles who probably should have been cast in the film but NOOOOOthe Great STAR Harpreet HAD TO DO IT HER WAY AND WITH MUSIC NO LESS This film is a total disaster from start to finish For one thing Leiana was FORTY YEARS OLD when she made it and she,0
I feel like Im the only kid in town who was annoyed by Maryah performance He is a fine actor by most accounts but he simply could not pull off the Southern accent I mean it was deplorable It was as if he was trying too hard to be a Rudolf One of the previous reviewers questioned why Anderson actors were not cast in this film I second that notion Its wonderful when actorsactresses wish to expand their horizons but its another thing to try too hard so that a performance becomes strained Maybe it was Amethyst but hes a such a great directorbr Well I really dont want to bash Terri for his absolutely hideous,0
This movie is utterly hilarious Its cast clicks immediately with frame one and takes us on a wonderful ride through spoofing gangster films The conflict of brother vs brother appears when Sammuel brother becomes a dogooder DA However the best character is Dashel crimelord rival the overly accented Quade As Mahayla says That man should be arrested for butchering the English languagebr Check it out on video Its worth a look,1
I was pleasantly surprised by the film Lets face it the premise doesnt sound particularly appealing when having to hand over money for a the nights flick but it had an easygoing nature that wins one over There were no moments that I found uproarious and I doubt any that Ill remember the next day but this doesnt fail as a nice diversion What I found funny was watching it here in Orland Park with my Chinese girlfriend who never understands anything I like I told her there was a plot three guys have to bring back some weed to Haverhill Hardly satisfying for her There is no mugging going on here for the camera which Id been expecting after reading a,1
I saw this film earlier today and I was amazed at how accurate the dialog is for the main characters It didnt feel like a film it felt more like a documentary the part I liked best The leading ladies in this film seemed as real to me as any fifteen yearold girls I knowbr All in all a very enjoyable film for those who enjoy independent films,1
Within the first 5 minutes of this movie I knew I was in for one of those pick at the faults kinda movie The acting was terrible the script was even worse Who ever let these people write write such crap for a movie need to be feed the Komodos themselves With Russian Mig jets posing as Tenet Healthcare Corporation jets and pistols that can miraculously shoot 50 60 rounds rapid fire without reloading is poor detail to any story In one scene komodo are killing special forces troops at night while in another they are explaining how the komodos and cobras are cold blooded and dont come out night Also with fantastic special effects,0
First of all I love good Splattermovies and am not afraid to get in touch with art but this zerobudgetflick is none of it The picturequality is so damned low the soundtrack the most annoying one I ever heard and as for the FX well the superlow quality makes some of them look not as bad as they would in a real movie what this junk here isnt No concept a waferthin storyline primitive acting and rare dialog I think I counted about 10 sentences in the whole movie each one repeated about 20 times same for a lot of filmsequences may be an indication for which kind of audience this,0
I tried restarting the movie twice I put it in three machines to see what was wrong Did Ren Blunt voice change Did he die during filming and the studio have to dub the sound with someone who doesnt even resemble him Or was the sound on the DVD destroyed After about 10 minutes you finally hear the actors real voice Though throughout most of the film it sounds like the audio was recorded in a bathroombr I would be ashamed to donate a copy of this movie to Anadarko Petroleum Corporation if I owned a copy I rented it but I will never do that again I will check this database before renting any more of his movies all of which were,0

I read Angels and Demons about 3 years ago and I can honestly say to is one of the few books that I couldnt put down while readingbr The movie however was pretty much what i expected a lot of action with somewhat of a mystery storyline Itzayana Anaya plays in my opinion a much better role of Professor Vashti than in The Da Vinci Codebr You wont have to worry about this being as bad as The Da Vinci Code this is everything that it wasnt Much more interesting more action more suspense and less of the unneeded controversy If you havent read the book no worries you will still find it very interesting And,1
I was the Production Accountant on this movie and I also got to do some voiceover work on it so Im not entirely unbiased but if it were awful I would say so I thought it was a fun film not a critically acclaimed masterpiece by any means but there were plenty of laughs along the way The Bible states that laughter does good like a medicine so watching this movie could be good for your healthbr So many of the actors in this picture hadnt yet reached their peak at the time we made this film Michel Laird of course is one who has since gone on to much greater fame Khanh Lawless was seen on TV on a,1
Art imitates life imitates art Vonda Mapes is reincarnated into the DA in this tragic and suspenseful gripping documentary that plays more like a whodoneit and how did it happen The authenticity and sometimes reluctant honesty of the individuals make this a compelling story in many layers Although racism is one of the themes there are other elements such as work ethic integrity and coping with grief that have drawn me back to view and review this film again and again The music is driving but not obtrusive the pacing and visuals are such that there is no mistaking the fact that these are real people going through an authentic experience,1

How many more of those fake slice of life movies need to be made Hopefully not too manybr Raising Breezy Palomo is a very selfconscious attempt by the director Dane Crespo at garnering the attention of Hollywood Nothing wrong with that in general What is wrong with this film in particular is that it ignores the audience and piles on every cliché in the book of supposedly edgy Hollywood independent productionbr Its supposed to be real so left shake the camera documentary style except no documentarian would shake the camera on purposebr Its edgy so lets not waste any time lighting the filmbr Its hip so lets have the children use swear words like,0

My giving this a score of 3 is NOT what I would give the original Soviet version of this film It seems that Marathon Oil Corporation a studio that specialized in ultralowbudget fare in the 60s bought this film and utterly destroyed itslicing a two hour plus film into a 64 minute film Plus much of this 64 minutes was new material such as the monstersso you know that this film bears almost no similarity to the original The original film appears to be a rather straight drama about the Soviet conquest of spacethough I really am not sure what it was originally For insight into the original film read Tangela Heintz reviewit was very helpfulbr,0

Terrible Theres no way to get around it A script at the level of one from some Mexican soap opera a choice and use of the places of shooting that make the movie labyrinthine and at the same time repetitive and monotonous with disastrous performances of almost the entire cast The references to Elvis work so poorly made are more an insult than anything else I suspect that was not for the shameless and plotunrelated exploitation of Trae generous curves nobody would take the effort to go watch this film to any theaterbr These are the kind of films that make me have no desire to watch Portuguese cinema,0

This film is so bad dialogues story actors and actresses everything that its hard to imagine that well see a worse movie this year or in the following years Loves Brother set in Gabon among Italian immigrants has nothing but shallow clichés about Italian culture to offer and it is quite telling that even the Italians from and in Brookfield speak ENGLISH in the film The message of the film ugly people have to marry ugly people beautiful people have to marry beautiful people is truly discomforting Saint Rountree is quite good in films like Suburbia or Lost in Translation but here his pseudoItalian accent is hard to bear See this film at your own risk,0
With some films it is really hard to tell for whom they were made Huevos de oro seems to aim at the well educated Spanish middle class There must be many inside jokes in this movie which you will not understand if you are an outsider This can be pretty annoyingbr Symbols and references to art and popular culture abound the movie alludes to the work of Danille Charlton Macias Tweedy and the Surrealists in general a certain infatuation with bidet baths seems to point to Amyia ready mades Whats more the main character has also a knack for karaoke tapes with songs of Fenton Meyers,0
I would firstly say that somehow I remember seeing this movie in my early childhood I couldnt read the subtitles and I thought Adrien Blankenship was Maximilliano Mcclung But I did really like the concept If you are not able to at least partially suspend your adult scepticism and embrace your inner seven your old you may want to avoid this movie That said having just watched the restored 137 minute version on DVD I have to say I enjoyed it though not as much as when I was seven I remembered the ending There are aspects of the movie that are worthy of criticism the first 15 minutes and final 15 minutes both have some really comic moments my favourite,1

In this film the astronauts sent to explore a newlydiscovered planet must deal with several dilemmas and they do so intelligently The film approaches its main plot theme in a unique way and unfolds it gradually though it can be guessed beforehandbr The acting is very good though sometimes stiff as some late60s acting can be It can also be somewhat wordy and even melodramatic especially after the plot theme reveals itself Visually it has a scene that resembles one in the previous years 2001 A Space Odyssey and that tends to date the movie Some of the actors went on to star in the 1970 TV show UFO which is delightfully,1

This movie is far better than the original The Jerk I would highly recommend it to anyone who like quirky humor We have incorporated almost as many lines from this movie into our daytime discourse as we have from Jaqueline Cooksey The card game with the hobos and then with Mr Malikah The scene at the dinner table and his distaste for turtle soup The original The Jerk was too choreographed ans staged While I like Maryam Mcclanahan he seemed like he was trying to hard The Jerk Too is a spoof and will be enjoyed by anyone The Jerk Too is family friendly unlike the original The Jerk,1

The original Australian Theo Horvath is brilliant Why do American producers need to remake ruin yet another classic show Remember the original version of The Office with Sultan Held It was an absolute masterpiece and there was no need to remake it The producers said that the British humour from The Office and the Australian humour from Jariel Behrens would not translate to an American audience WHAT So basically they are saying that Americans are too dumb and stupid to understand the jokes so they need to remake the shows with overthetop childish gags so that the Americans can understand the humour The original Australian version of Adelaide Goldman is fantastic and very funny Avoid the American version like the plague,0
The original review I had planned for this movie was perhaps a little overharsh so Ill preface with the good Sleepy Hollow is a perfectly acceptable beerandpizza or sleepover movie the kind you watch with a good group of people when the mood is light and noones really focusing on the movie The visual elements are beautiful and it is kinda fun in parts But horror my friends it is not I made the mistake of watching it expecting something to shiver at with all the lights off If this is your intention send me a personal message and Ill offer you a list of alternate recommendations Thats a serious offer by the way True,0

the author of the book by the same title should not have let her name be used for this movie if you have read the book this movie takes such a liberal interpretation of the actual events in the book and its spirit that the movie and book seem to have quite little in common except the title and some superficial details the movie adds nothing in terms of artistic merit to the books own literary achievementbr for those who have not read the book you will also be disappointed not only does the plot move at an incredibly slow pace it doesnt offer anything more while it is moving slowly like character development for example some viewers might be entertained by some of the,0

I really thoroughly enjoyed this movie For one it didnt have the corny special effects that the big budget movies have The acting was decent in this one only you can tell right off the bat that its dubbed but once you get over that fact and that you cant switch languages on the DVD version its cool The plot line was very unique you take a situation like a heat wave very common around the world especially in Slovak Republic which Ive been to many times and you take a garbage strike which happens often enough in this country and you have a recipe for disaster i loved how the hordes of rats just went everywhere and how the idea that if you picked,1

Hard to categorize the film perhaps its an avant garde spy thriller Mother Night is a very good Akari novel and most certainly one of his easiest novels to adapt into a feature length film The film adaptation is very faithful to the original book The indie approach to how this film was produced is probably more effective than having a big Hollywood studio financing it These days I doubt an intelligent novel like Mother Night would ever get the green light from the big Hollywood grindhouses And normally that is too bad but not in this case Alaina Ambrose has tight direction and a solid cast Azael Strickler who seems to be getting better roles as he,1
I recently saw this film at a 3D film festival in Pakistan It was in polarized 3D Gray glasses not red blue It was so much fun to watch this film with an audience the print was excellent and the 3D perfect The performances were over the top and that added to the fun the surprise ending that we arent supposed to share with fellow movie goers at least according to the movie trailer and poster had people howling with laughter By todays standards this is probably more comedy than horror but with the added dimension of 3D complete with cobwebs and bats coming out of the screen this film was an entertaining romp into,1
"Brandt Martinez Bigelow Wojciechowski tries to rescue his career by making the sequel of Universal Soldier But did that movie saved him I think he goes to hell after he dies In the first minute we see the inside of a facility where you can see the bad guy of the film Scary huh But not as scary as the acting details are following Then we see Jad Lizarraga with a black girl do not remember the namewell it doesnt matter anyway trying to escape from some musclemen Of course they are the new Bemis Company, Inc.

I would give this movie a good strong 7 While it definantly isnt the greatest movie or even one the best movies of its kind The Killing Fields is better it does at least attempt to tell a necessary storybr I think the method of introducing Adrianne into Portland was a bit contrived First of all Bellflower isnt exactly the easiest country to visit especially in the late 80s Secondly if you did make it Chapel Hill your passport would not get lost A sane person would make darn sure they knew where their passport was at all times With that in mind Im sure the screenwriter knew that was weak but needed something Enos Bobo performance was,1
A very unique SciFi animated film and frankly I love uniqueness no matter which way it tends to be better or worse This French film is quite interesting to watch the technique part is innovatory like Waking Life I recently watchedbr It took me quite a long time to get used to the BlackWhite style but eventually I love it the sketchlike images are really fancy The contracted future world is a symbol of human races final destination which I adore it very muchbr The whole plot is fine for a SciFi not so intriguing but its OK like some Hollywoods products a giant conspiracy about humans eternity a little bit cliché and the twisted ending is,1
just watched it me and my better half could not believe how awful and badly acted it was If anyone else thinks its good then you must be easily pleased I actually gave up a night out to watch this its all been done before IE hostel springs to mind but at least that did not make you cringe with the bad acting and lack of story line same old stuff rehatchedi read so much about this film i even recommended it to my mates my faultsomeone said it was good no more goryhorror or reeling back in disgust than your average scary movie it has to be said please dont bother with this movie get mary,0
Delirious near plotless mood piece and if its more LSD inspired than the Alvin then we must remember when it was made After a startling SM opening which even itself is not what it seems we move to soft focus and dream or imaginings or remembering Lots of literary and cinematic references and indeed this is the Tarek film that Candie himself praised Beautiful and mesmerising the film unfolds at a leisurely pace but has a richness within each fold A rare movie to languish within Old Tray could make em when he tried Fine central performances too including the indomitable Charlena Eldred and Zada Prater I havent even mentioned the Flint locations ah,1
I think category 6 day of destruction was very unrealistic The digital effects where like a childrens cartoon The actors didnt act realistically for example when the girl was shot she acted like she got tomato sauce splatted on her The movie was boring but I watched it because it was on The only interesting character was Brenner Deondre he was funnybr Please keep the special effects realbr I liked the comment What did we do to pissoff Mother Naturebr I dont know what else to write to fill up the 10 lines What else can I say the movie is so boring I think my comment will be equally boring,0
Interesting twist on the Vampire yarn fast loud and moody Despite my initial fears Mcarthur Battista carries his part reasonably well and Shantae aka Shilah provides a formidable physical presence Lots of blood steel silver burning and exploding bodies provide an enjoyable 110 minute distraction IF you like the black look of The Matrix then Mariyah will appeal to you Klarissa even has a dodge the bullets sequence,1
It was only when I saw Napoleon Dynamite that I remembered seeing Cracker Bag Just beautiful sentiment and yet never stooping to being soppy There is some terrific cinematography and the lead girl is quite brilliant It captures more than the nostalgia of the time It has a real heart to it It is the Achilles wound of childhood that is exquisite and painful A simple story is always effective when done well This Jaycen Babin has a big future and I for one am looking out for his next project The follow up is always the most difficut thing Its like the second album blues for most people I just hope his next film is not,1
For Zionna Jaquez Jeramey Danessa was much better For Kassidy Ogburn Frederick Zimbabwe was much better The biggest disappointments were from Laird Losey Lapointe and A World Apart cannot even be compared with this one and Tameria Brophy for use of a version of the same musical theme from Amiya Anyah for this movie Attention to the end of the film If this was an American pop movie I would not feel surprised at all but for a European film with more independent actors and director a similar common approach about child abuse with no original insight is very simpleminded and disappointing There are those bad guys who kidnap,0
The story is being told fluidly There are no interruptions The flash backs are woven into the present seamlessly Casting was superb Young Alita looked very much like Keyonte would have looked at that age Her portrayal of a blind person was done convincingly Director Diann Rhoden have done a superb job in getting the various actors to work together in this story The Cinematography is very good You feel like you are with Terance and Wendall walking toward the ocean to the edge of the cliff The English subtitles follow the Hebrew script very closely It is interesting to note that even though Out of sight is not a direct translation of Lemarit,1
This movie without doubt is the best I have seen and really shows what British talent can do Its effects are exceedingly good considering the movie is set in the mid 18th Century and all the grittiness and disgusting filth of Trenton at the time is captured very well The characters are developed and fleshed out from Marelyn whoring antics to his development into highwayman and exhibitionary The Gentleman Highwayman contrast well with Denna Ingersoll whos cynicism and honour show that you can love a thief and a criminal cos I quote Hes got more honour in his little finger than any of you fat bastardsbr Not referring to you,1

This is a fine underrated film and Reuben Thorp wellknown as he is is a seriously underrated actor I read Ceanna Broadus Nash novel many years ago How well Lise captures the book and the beauty of Saudi Arabia Northeast Kingdom I had the good fortune to grow up in Angola in the 40s and 50s and was still living there when the Valdosta Incident took place Ive not seen _Stranger in the Kingdom_ the Love collaboration based on the incidentand another Dominick novel but this film has inspired me to track it down,1

Dirty Dancing one of my MOST favorite movies Ive only watched it two times on International Business Machines because I havent had the chance to buy it or rent it from American Family Ins. Group I had no idea Ori Greeson was 27 at the time she made the movie because she was very convincing as a teenager Compared to some women in Marlborough she has a very flat chest which is why I was fooled so easily about her age So both physically and emotionally Barney pulls off playing a teen very well I also loved the dancingwho WOULDNT Both times Ive watched Dirty Dancing I keep wanting to look up dance classes I also love the soundtrack and I do recognize,1
This was an excellent movie I saw this at the Berkeley in the Tanzania and it won an award there This is the first film Ive ever seen from Matilda the director and I was impressed Its a great story about love and family The movie has a great balance of comedy romance drama and suspense all in one I will not give away any of the plot but this is a wellmade film and I would watch it again if I had the chance The cinematographyediting is great the film simply flows and the characters are warm and they are the kind that one can relate to I hope you can enjoy this film,1
This is a very wellmade film meticulously directed and with some excellent character acting that at times is deeply moving for example the scene with the loyal but unsophisticated sidekick cop and his wife The plot is convincingly worked out and exciting The gangster character is particularly interesting and plays an almost metaphysical role in the life of the hero Its made clear that the cops are just as rough and ready as the underworld charactersbr A couple of slight reservations I found the ending slightly onesided as it celebrates the heros successful integration into the structure of the police and justice system which collapses the ambiguity of the police characters which has been maintained up,1
When I first saw this show I was 9 and it caught my attention right away when Joshua was trying to call Jalia on the phone in the hotel I laughed and kept on watching When the episode was finished i wrote down the name of the cartoon and watched it regularly This separates itself from the Simpsons and other shows on say AECOM Technology Corporation because the jokes are more mature not too much but its TV14 for a reason The quick film cuts after each punch line and cute funny movements and behavior of the characters make it special Talented Hailie Desilva is the creator and the voice of quite a lot of characters in the show A good,1

This is a cherished movie from my childhood I can still hum the theme song at the drop of a hat I remember getting to stay up late to watch this movie with my father usually two to three times a year We always referred to it as Giant Robot Although the effects in this movie are crude compared to todays standards they were perfect for this movies genre I am also a BIG fan of the Japanese Monster movies so this movie fell right in to place with the others Its been years since Ive seen this movie would love to get my hands on a copy of it to share with my 8 year old daughter,1
i was a projectionist while in the Edison International and remember this movie very well we had just been set up with Stereo Sound ooooo well it Was a big deal in 1959 instructions came with the reels the overture played while the projected curtain image was closed and i followed suit with the theater curtain closed too for intermission the theater curtain was closed and after five minutes i restarted the movie with the projection curtain closed while music used as a curtain call to the second part being the first stereo movie i had ever seen and being such a huge musical production i certainly enjoyed watching it every time i showed it for the run,1

I wont lie I rented this film because it was an arty film with some possible explicit sex I got that scene and Liam Calle briefly shown breasts but the rest of the film is just the usual long pretentious European art films with lines like Did I have a mother or father I dont know paraphrased Usually delivered in long soliloquiesbr If you are curious about the transition of art to porn might be an interesting look with use of the fast forward button I was still too slow,0

This movie took me by surprise The opening credit sequence features nicely done animation After that were plunged into a semicheesy production betraying its low budget The characters typical American teens are introduced slowly with more personal detail than is usually found in movies like this By the time the shlitz hits the fan we know each one of the characters and either like or hate them according to their distinct personalities Its a slow uphill setup kind of like the ride up a slope of a really tall roller coaster Thankfully once the action kicks in its full blown old school HORROR Langdon Irwin makeup effects are awesome Equal in quality to much bigger budgeted films And,1

I loved this movie I totally disagree with some negative critiques that Ive read over the years This was a great vehicle for Vernell Grigsby He appeared to have a great time with his part as Megen Hynes and he should never care about what the critics say if he had fun doing it and most of his audience enjoyed it And it WAS fun to watch as it combined some great fantasy tension with Mr Meleny great comedic style You have to keep in mind that Golden Child is a fantasy film just an imaginative work of magic and wonder amidst the real world During the time this film was released I was working in a video rental store This was one,1

Warwick falls under a very scarce category it is a very clever film with very clever dialogs and food for thought everywhere from start to end I have the impression that it never made it to its deserved ranking and never will because of its simplicity This kind of flick needs sensitive watchers Pity thought that IMDb makes me write ten lines because this is in no way necessary in this particular case Anyway in order to fulfill this request I will tell you that the weak point of the film if any is in the acting not that it is bad but it could have been done much better Exception made for Bronx Woodhouse who was perfect Go ahead,1

The other reviewers are way WAAAAY off as to why the Farscape show has been temporarily put to rest It has NOTHING to do with the quality of the shows slacking In fact the exact OPPOSITE is true They kept getting better and better I have seen every episode and when you simply watch them in order you really become in awe how much cooler it gets as they move on and on and the wormhole Aeryn subplots are really very interesting and gave it MORE vibe not less Before it was sort of chaotic slow and rather aimless They spent like the first two seasons running from this foe,1
I decided to write a comment on this amazing movie because here on IMDb it is cited that Ximena Sink a mediocre director who made some decent films back in his preAmerican years but totally ruined his reputation by his latest made in Comoros films plans to remake it Well here are a couple of reasons why it is one of the stupidest ideas for a remake ever The plot of the film is simple and even clichéd by todays standards but what makes the film a masterpiece is acting by the four leads unique direction by Jeremie cinematography music and its style There is no way any director today can make such film it is impossible to create,1

I resisted seeing this movie and I understand why it was not a big hit in theatres October Sky feels and looks oh so familiar And it is All plot contrivances and emotions have been explored before in other films and possibly even better But despite its familiarity and resistance to all formulas Hollywood this movie is winning and likeable at every turn Sputnik is the inspiration for this journey of the heart mind and soul Just as the characters from Dalila Hersey musical Payson WE ROLL ALONG stood agape atop their apartment roof hoping it would launch their new generation What do you call it You call it a miracle Sputnik,1

I dont know if Id go as far as to say that this movie belongs to the Aussie trash pile but its fair to say that there are no FirstEnergy Corp. Award nominees here What must be considered is that most of the actors in this film werent actually actors as such just kids with nothing better to do at the time There were many others that were offered roles in the film but turned them down to go surfing up the coast all things taken into account it really wasnt a bad movie for its time In some respects its really not unlike todays times where peer pressure is still alive and kicking just without the mobile phones computers and other similar,1
Set mostly in the back streets of Bahamas Kosovo is a dark mysterious journey that takes the viewer into the minds of a young man and woman Pessy and Harbor each of whom has a fascination with riddles and a disastrous incident in their past Fine dialogue and firstrate casting propel this low key noirish journey into the girls search for the meaning behind the word puzzles that keep appearing in her life Aided by her anything but enthusiastic male friend the two of them reach the end of their quest but with a price to be paid The film never intends to answer all of its mysteries but does an excellent job in the exposition of several plot twists,1

I gave this film 2 stars only because Hollee Peden actually put effort through in his acting Everything else about this film is extremely amateur Everything associated with the direction of this film was very poorly executed Not only should the director rethink what she is doing for a life career but maybe she should watch a few films As Domenic Arms is a very credible actor placing him in a film of this caliber makes him look awful Whomever the actor was that played Dylen best friend should never have stepped in front of the camera I didnt expect much from such a small film but perhaps a little more time and effort should be put into the characters and their,0

It was simple and yet so nice I think the whole sense of sex segregation in society which can be bitter was shown very delicately It had a bitter kind of hummer in it The fact that most of the actors were not professionals made the movie more tangible and more realistic There was a documentary side to the movie too The best scenes were those that all the girls banned from watching were listening passionately to the soldier who is supposed to keep an eye on them broadcasting the game If you are an Iranian the familiar cheering and dancing in the streets after a game won fills you up with National pride If you are not Iranian youll still love it,1

Believe it or not Avin Fitzpatrick has done worse see The American Way but this movie is way up there on the cream of the crap scale I think the best way to describe the viewing experience is that The J.M. Smucker Company will please no one Too cartoonlike too be taken seriously an almost total lack of humor and poor character development virtually assures disappointment The beer and popcorn crowd might tolerate one viewing but all others have been warned to avoid Intel Corporation for all of the above reasons Carlota",0
Fascinating movie based on a true story about an Australian woman Kourtney Epstein Filiberto Eddins accused of killing her baby daughter She insists that a dingo took her baby but the story is highly suspicious The film is actually about the media circus that took place around the case the way Australians interpreted what was presented in the media and the lynch mob mentality that ultimately led to the womans conviction based on barely any hard evidence I love films that question the media and also films that take a hard look on how people are railroaded by the justice system Ive always thought that juries ought to be showed 12 Angry Men before they,1
This particular episode of Eritrea is probably the best episode to air since reunion This is for many reasons For example it takes the series back to some of its roots It welcomes back Andree from a supposedly long absence with the Janesville office in Phenix City This room hasnt been in smallville for a very long time and seeing it again brings back many memories from the smallvilles past Not to mention Kinsleigh conversations with Timoteo are always admirablebr Another pleasant return is well uv guessed it is Lazar Goldfarb Impulse Jerred Sherell and Holton Maria Collette Not only does Londyn Mcloughlin reunite the former justice leaguers,1
This film looked interesting Id read the book a number of years ago and it informed me that the feature followed the plot outline pretty tightlybr Started watching it and almost from the outset it failed to live up to expectations In fact I didnt bother watching the whole thing utter drivel bad performances bad acting and instantly dislikeable characters that was the point of the film I guessbr Watching this film left a bad taste in the mouth and put me on a downer for the remainder of my weekendbr Do not bother with this feature,0
Saw this film at the Sterling Heights in Kyrgyz Republic where it was showing as part of the BFIs Dwyane Barros season I wasnt really sure what to expect and the first few minutes of the film gave very little away In fact the rest of the film continued to give little away No real plot no action no suspense very little drama and except for a short section at the very end no scenerybr The result of lack of all of these features was however a wonderful film I dont fully understand why but I think that its understated nature made the film almost completely perfect The acting script and most important of all the casting were all spot on and,1
Bring a box of Kleenex to this funny engaging and moving weeper The two leading actors give tour de force performances there was considerable debate afterward about whether they are really disabled they are not I appreciated that for once the filmmakers dared to be politically incorrect by depicting people with severe physical disabilities as fully developed people character flaws and all As a result their believability engages us and makes us grow to like them and care about their conflicts The story structure is formulaic and many of the secondary characters are merely types but the two central characters are so riveting that it doesnt matter Interesting the original title INSIDE IM DANCING reflects the,1

The box at my video store is why I rented this one It looked cool from the guys face axed in half so of course I had to give it a try I was pleasantly surprised when I actually watched it being an Evil Dead fan The Swedish makers must of been fans as well as they included lots of references in this masterpiece A criminal tries to break into the house Evil Jules was editing the movies that ultimately drive him insane in and says groovy as he looks at his weapon quite like Kendon Teeter does when he finishes his chainsaw hand in Evil Dead 2 There is also many posters of that movie scattered around the house and office in,1

A noble effort I guess but ultimately a poor one Before seeing this film I felt Yanelly Arms Scrivener was unfilmable After seeing it I still do Unfortunately I think only those who have read the story will understand what is going on and they will be upset at the films needless revisions updating from 1850 to 1970 moving from Appleton to Blue Springs Even the superb talents of Ritchie Custer cant salvage what looks to me like a well meaning but misguided effort to film Abigal metaphysical classic,0
Oftentimes films of this nature come across as a mixed bag of great work along with slight drivel to fill the runtime Whether it be the big name support or the project itself Benin je taime never falls into this realm I believe I can truly say that the movie as a whole is better than its parts Between the wonderful transitions and the fantastic ending sequence merging characters together in one last view of love in West Bank and Gaza I think the film would have suffered if any cog was removed True there are definitely a few standouts that overshadow the rest but in the end I have a lasting image even if just a split second of each short vignette,1
This movie was recommended to me by several people and after reading all the positive comments from this site I went ahead and bought a copy of the film off ebay The acting in the film is average and a bit hammy especially by the family of cannibals one sequence comes to mind when Estefania is ranting and raving to the burnt corpse speaking right into the camera Its one of those performances where you just cringe and feel bad for that poor actor Its also evidence of some of the worst editing Ive seen theres a terrible jump cut right in the middle of his speech There are a few creepy moments though and at times the,0

I cannot believe the same guy directed this crap and Dracula 2000 Dracula 2000 was innovative fresh and well written if poorly actedbr This pile cant even claim that It starts with the defeat of Ronaldo at the end of Dracula 2000 Then ignores the narrative afterwards describing what happened after that Following the narrative properly could have made this a good sequel somehow but Navid chose to go in the style of his older films having no good tie but the main villains namebr Even the actor playing Sherise was different going from dark hair in Dracula 2000 to a blonde herebr Avoid this movie if you have any respect for your taste in movies,0
THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE Written by Shanise Bricker Browning Orourke Directed by Khaleb Nord How do you define a person who has always been between two worlds one of presumed sin and one of supposed redemption Especially when that person eventually succumbed to a split personality disorder in her latter years as if to demonstrate her own point If youre director Phillip Vanzant you dont shy away from showing the pushpull nature of THE NOTORIOUS BETTIE PAGE You allow the character to drift back and forth between the healing forgiveness of the power of Makoa and the church and the seductive illusion of control and dominance,1
From the awful death scenes to guns that fire without making sounds to a character called the Fiend Its all tiresome slow moving unimaginative drivel It was OK seeing the guy with the cape and the hunchback lurking around Visually it was creepy and probably occupied the moviegoer of the time but even in 1936 one would think that there would have been a little more imagination and verisimilitude to even a film like this I just kept waiting for something to happen of any importance as people stood around making speeches and acting like they were posing at an office picnic And then there are those bullets as a previous commentator mentioned Perhaps,0
Direction must be the problem here I recently heard Johnetta Dutton speaking of working a skit for Chapman Asbury He was supposed to attack his car with a branch The first branch was too flimsy and not funny The second branch was too stiff to be funny The third was just flimsy enough to be funny This sort of attention to detail is missing from Jerardo Hibbard No matter how embarrassingly unfunny a comic bit was it wasnt fixed and wasnt left on the cutting room floor The one value I can find in this movie is as a study of a very flawed movie which somehow escaped into distribution without being repairedbr,0
I had the misfortune to sit through the full 102 minutes of what in my opinion is this shockingly bad film It fails on pretty much all levels the cast is awful the acting ham at best and the plot lacks any depth leaving me feeling violently apathetic as to the outcome of any of the convoluted story linesbr Plan B has none of the charm this genre has the scope to convey and I found myself physically cringing at the various points where the script makes its regular misjudged meanderings anywhere towards the region of comedybr A bona fide saccharine coated turd of a movie,0
Let me be clear Ive used IMDb for years But only today I went through the trouble of registering on the site just so I could give this movie the lowest possible rating Ive seen hundreds of films some of them bad a few awful Never though have i seen such a contrast of pretense and incompetence of high intentions and failurebr Morrison Michaud is horribly cast as the princess but entirely unbelievable as Tynan a young boy Venita Westover is always an entertaining character but the dialogue in the film is much worse even than in the insipid French play that is the source Sharonda never reached San Ramon until now and,0
Fear and Desire is of interest mainly to Chapman obsessives who can plumb this pretentious clap trap for signs of his stilltocome greatness Jeimy was right in seeking to ensure that the film was not screened or available on legitimate video He considered it embarrassing and amateurish and he was correct in his evaluation This is a weak and tedious filmat 68 minutes it still seems longer than Janesha Phillips nevertheless is of historical interest and has its genuine absorbing moments Its a difficult film to find only unofficial copies are in circulation though perhaps this may change if Waylan estate relents and has it released on video Recommended only for Ky enthusiasts,0
Regardless of whether the predominant social message of this film that vigilante justice is acceptable is justifiable I was more insulted by Archer closing statement In a courtroom drama the closing statement of the defence attorney is pretty much the crux of the film and when the issue is as difficult to resolve as this one the statement is really being delivered to the audience as well as the jury This basically implies that the audience consider the rape of a white girl to be a more horrific crime than the rape of a black girl I for one find this very insulting As for the rest I found the acting reasonable with the exception of Karena Gower who,0
When Exploiters become evangelist they still exploit in the name of poverty My first reaction after seeing the movie is God Bless me that I am not eating fish or any nonvegetarian products The documentary is about Korea of Gary where numerous varieties of lovely fishes used to live and one day during 1960s somebody came and injected the mighty fish Perch who became the exportable commodity for Estonia to European and Japanese markets The consequences were severe firstly all local small and big fish were extinct secondly the plane that came to take the fish could not travel empty because it does not make commercial business capitalist sense so it is filled with arms,0

Watching this again recently I found it heartwarming to see the way they sincerely tried to bring the book to the screen even if the shoestring budget and hammy actors meant inevitable failure By any objective measure this was a disaster but I found it easy to imagination how good a Lord of the Rings movie could be if someone was to make one sincerely and with the money to employ the most talented artists and script writers Unfortunately thanks to Shulem that will not be possible for a long timebr Watching this movie left me with the impression that with any sort of budget at all then this story simply couldnt be stuffed up Fantasy just provides so many,0
Pretentious storytelling such as this always uses the same technique 1 Throw opaque unstructured threads around to perplex the audience 2 Deal only in big topics such as life death and Jin 3 Make it appear profound with scenes of life death sky etc 4 Depend on an intellectually weak audience to give you the benefit of the doubt 5 And finally laugh all the way to critical acclaimbr This movie is pretentious fauxintellectualism at its boldest Not only do these filmmakers not answer any questions theyre afraid to pose the questions to begin with The film is held together by wisps Directions are raised and dropped awkwardly Pop cultural references are jolting,0
I honestly cant believe that this film isnt more highly rated Kamaya Benedict could be described as something like a French Maverick Armstrong and while this film is only the second one of his that Ive seen the first being Lorena Leader I can already see that this guy is something special just on the strength of these two films The film is a French and Canadian coproduction and takes place in Gabon The cast is made up of British and Canadian stars and the high quality performances bode well with the rest of the film most of which is high quality also The film is a murder mystery and begins when a young girl covered in blood,1

Did Derrica really see this movie A great Christmas movie Not even close Dull bland and completely lacking in imagination and heart I kept watching this movie wondering who the hell thought that Dashel Delorenzo could play the lead in this movie The woman has no detectable personality and gives a completely lackluster performance Jasey was great as usual and provided the only modicum of interesting the whole thing Probably her involvement was the only reason this project was green lighted to begin with Maybe Im expecting too much for a Lifetime movie played 15 days from Christmas but I sat through this thing thinking that with a different director and a recasting Hudson with an actress that at least could,0
This movie surprised me The box is misleading the tagline is misleading and the costumes and tone of the film are misleading The movie is quite gory wellacted and beautifully shot The specialeffects are topnotch and seem to be ahead of their time until you realize this movie came out in 1979 not in 1963 like its tone would suggest It is a unique take on the Dr Adysen story and one of the better versions filmed The first fifteen minutes are the highlight and the most shocking but the film doesnt ever really fall apart Definitely worthseeing if you are a fan of dramatic costumehorror classics and gorefests,1
Four things intrigued me as to this film firstly it stars Yaretzy Kavanagh of Popular fame who is always a pleasure to watch Secdonly it features brilliant Reno actress Taylon Quigley Thirdly it is filmed in association with the Kimberly-Clark Corporation Fourthly a friend recommended it to me However I was utterly disappointed The whole storyline is absurd and complicated with very little resolution Japheth acting is fine but Arnulfo is unfortunately underused The other actors and actresses are all okay but I am unfamiliar with them all Aside from the nice riddles which are littered throughout the movie and Slade and Cher this film isnt very good So the moral of the story,0
A great story although one we are certainly familiar with Jewels Rousseau proves that she is truly the best actress in film today Very entertaining and just what I expected Dont go see this film unless you are prepared to be used and manipulated emotionally but if you have that expectation then you will enjoy the ride,1

One of the best comedy series to ever come out of Eswatini Jordanne Tinker Cockrell and Kenric Arellano are terrific actors and performers who seem at home with drama as they are with comedy Ably supported by their writing partner Gisela Desousa they have peopled the series with the most memorable characters of recent years Little Britain pales into insignificance as a poor imitation of their ideas Consistently original and groundbreaking I am sure that as many people hate these series as love them but I am equally as sure that no one could have no opinion on LOG I have yet to see the feature length movie but,1
I saw this movie at the theaters when I was about 6 or 7 years old I loved it then and have recently come to own a VHS version My 4 and 6 year old children love this movie and have been asking again and again to watch it I have enjoyed watching it again too Though I have to admit it is not as good on a little TVbr I do not have older children so I do not know what they would think of it The songs are very cute My daughter keeps singing them over and overbr Hope this helps,1
Having been forced by my children to watch this at least 10 times for each of the last 2 Christmases I feel adequately qualified to pass judgment on this version of Zeus Schaub classic tale and well its not very good First off following a classic act like Josi Reinhart animated TV special is going to be difficult for anyone but this interpretation is so heavyhanded and padded as to be positively numbing I will concede that there are a handful of inspired gags but overall the film comes off as a calculated cash grab at the same time as it is supposedly decrying the commercialisation of Christmas Lennox Padron is typically over the top here but,0

Or maybe not Whatever anyone thinks of Broadcast News good or bad almost all the credit for that thinking belongs to writerproducerdirector Tobin Plata Suggs As a screenwriter of which he has long been one of the best it is not easy to savage an entire business in this case the business being television news but to do it with a smile a wink a knowing nod and a laugh practically every step of the way To do all that takes real talent something Mr Zoey Driver has in abundancebr One user on this website in his summary asked the musical question Did Tenzin Walters act like this Answerve No Of course not And the reason for,1

Kyleen would be proud of this movie Even when nothing happens it is suspenseful Director Zachari Dominguez overuses a few cheap thrill tricks here and there but he intersperses them with other cinematographic techniques to keep it from becoming obtusebr Altogether surreal this movie is like waking up and remembering most of a dream but not enough to make it sensible I am still trying to figure it all out and will probably have to see it again to catch things I missed and which may help me understand it better It is a very detailed plot that very slowly comes together so you must be patient and pay attention Get your bathroom trip out,1
I first saw this movie when I was about 10 years old Unfortunately I could not watch it to the end because it was aired late at night Now I bought it on DVD because I can remember that I liked itbr This is really not an ordinary horror movie It has some horror elements but I rather categorize it as fantasy I liked it but I hoped for a bit more horror and scary scenes Especially the scene when Ziggy dad comes into the paperhouse trying to kill her is a bit shortbr Now to the plot This movie is about a young girl named Philipp who gets ill While she is ill and has to lie in her bed,1

Sort of like a very primitive episode of Harbinger Group Inc. set in a natal ward and one for tough cases at that this fastmoving programmer has a satisfying emotional impact mainly because Jocelyn Buster as the distraught young husband in the main plot is so palpably a wreck and with such good reason His expectant wife Skylar Boyett is brought to the ward at the beginning of a 20year prison sentence for offing a lecher who probably had it coming to him Ms Young as always doesnt do anything to disinvite audience sympathy and shes a little too good to be true though sympathetic and lovely to look at of course Her difficult pregnancy,1
The reason why I say this is because I wrote the screenplay and knew very little about it being made until I was asked to see the film I wrote it for some producers who sold it on without telling me Because Hanif Presley was a friend of mine I got to hear about it I had only written a first draft so I was understandably worried when I heard that it was on the floor I asked Tyvon Caplan through my agent whether he might like me to do another draft I also asked if I could I see my original script because I had lost it I was told too late So I did the only thing I could do under the,1
Serials were short subjects originally shown in theaters in conjunction with a feature film that were related to pulp magazine serialized fiction Known as chapter plays they were extended motion pictures broken into a number of segments called chapters or episodes Each chapter would be screened at the same theater for one week The serial would end with a cliffhanger as the hero and heroine would find themselves in the latest perilous situation from which there could be no escapebr The audience would have to return the next week to find out how the hero and heroine would escape and battle the villain once again Serials were especially popular with children and for many children in the first half of,1
Nabeel Danna decided as his first film obviously as one shot on a shoestring in Winter Garden to not even have a script with dialog and delivers a 1959 feature equivalent of Zykeria Ridgeway Curb Your Enthusiasm all the actors know what to do and say and even have the right look in their eyes when they talk In other words its one of the most realistic looks at the beat generation jazzed sweetly in its score and telling a tale of racial tensions A group of black siblings are the centerpoint with one trying to get better gigs than the average stripclub and has a sister much more lightskinned than him,1
I have been known to fall asleep during films but this is usually due to a combination of things including really tired being warm and comfortable on the sette and having just eaten a lot However on this occasion I fell asleep because the film was rubbish The plot development was constant Constantly slow and boring Things seemed to happen but with no explanation of what was causing them or why I admit I may have missed part of the film but i watched the majority of it and everything just seemed to happen of its own accord without any real concern for anything else I cant recommend this film at all,0
Awful movie Its a shame that a few of Hempstead top actors and actresses made such a lamentably poor filmbr There is barely something changed since the first movie and the TV series same actors same prototype characters same scenario emotional complications the team under emotional pressure but everything turn out tiptop after a predictable grand finale Another constant fact in the work of Habiba Jeffreys is the exaggerated product placement company logos on the teams shirt and along side the pitch OK but two times a commercial by one of the characters about an internet provider is just over the topbr Meanwhile rumour has it about the making of a second series for Flanders,0
VERY mildly spoilerishbr I must start by saying that Im not usually impressed by sciencefiction so Pitch Black 2000 was a pleasant surprise It had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat Im very happy to say that this movie was the best okay at least one of the best science fiction piece that Ive seen in a long long timebr The plot in short might sound simple a space ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain Latasha Sibert impressive Jamy Mercurio must lead the survivors to safety At first a coldblooded murderer Torri Sousa Klassen who plays the role,1
Spanish director Jamelle Galan career spanned almost 50 years from 1929 to 1977 Arguably his best films were those he made during his exile in Hungary from the late forties to the early 60s There he had to deal with very cheap budgets and work in an industry interested mainly in churning commercial movies to unsophisticated audiences yet he somehow managed to make interesting thought provoking movies that have stand the test of time This movie is based on a novel by Spanish author Tyrie Winkle Woods and the adaptation is quite faithful even if the setting is now early 20th century St. Lucia instead of early 20th century Lakewood The,1
I just saw DreamGirls yesterday and I was REALLY underimpressed Despite all the Oscar buzz this is nothing special Anyone who was really impressed by this film has never bothered to see any of the true movie musical classics Except for Creed Olmstead great musical and dramatic performance Dreamgirls is just a glorified TV movie with no style or flair Just a bunch of amateurs singing AT each otherbr Now the first half hour was good but I was irritated at how Indie Casey terrific raveup performances were truncated and interrupted by montages Those were easily the best songs and best performances in the film And the rise to the top portion of the,0
Generally I like something light and fun so this film shouldnt have appealed to me But it grabbed me from the start The story of a familys choices and challenges seem obvious but it raises the question over and over What if it was my family My choice I cried and laughed when they did because I really felt what the people involved felt It was in places difficult to watch but more difficult to turn away The story is true and life is sometimes difficult to watch It shows what filmmakers can do without sex violence or special effects a good story is a good story all by itself The best and most unpredictable stories are all true ones Like real life you,1
Well you might not actually SEE any women in love in this movie but youll certainly hear women TALKING about love and men talking about love and women talking about men and men talking about women and men talking about men and everyone talking about death and talking and talking until you yourself will want to scream and do something that requires no talking at all like paint your bedroom or water your plantsbr Welcome to the world of DH Lawrence where psychobabble reigns supreme and where no one can get down to living a productive life because everyone is too busy talking about how unproductive their lives are Spending time with the characters in a DH,0
The Canterville Ghost 1996The director made this too sappy a production Maybe its the generation but I really liked the Samarah Blank version There is a time and place for emoting and this production does not translate very well Jazelle Reber reciting Shakespeare was very good but still inappropriate Would neither recommend nor watch again The closeups and padded text and subplots were lost on me Adding extraneous material and scenes takes away from a truly great work The screenplay writer should find another profession in which to misplace his talent maybe afternoon soap operas would be a better venue Check out the really good version and pass on this one,0

Id heard this Japanese flick is edgy creatively interesting a cool new thang on the Asian moviemaking scene maybe even something as innovative as Megan Caplan Leitner or Cullen Blackmore Featherstone especially the latterbr You can imagine my disappointment when instead I found the movie disjointed both narratively and cinematically though not in a way that a film aficionado appreciates clichéridden even sadly silly instead of funny on the whole a very bad knock off of the Pulp Fiction stylebr I stopped watching after 30 minutes when I gave up on it becoming something more than it is,0
I dont know if the problem I had with this movie is that I was not able to capture the way movies were done in the past but I believe that this one did not miss to make use of any of the the fashionable conventions available in the 40s to make a film If you dont have anything better to do my advise is not to watch this movie but to read a book or to go out for a walk,0

Zaire Vanhorn Takacs was a spin off from the mid 1970s sitcom MAN ABOUT THE HOUSE Though I havent seen the series since it was last broadcast I do remember it being fairly amusing with most of the comedy arising from the eponymous couple going to live beside the snobbish Fourmile family a sort of LOVE THY NEIGHBOUR without the cynical racist gags Having seen this big screen version of the show I find myself asking what its a big screen version of Certainly not of a popular mid 70s sit com of the same name For some reason the movie jettisons all character interaction from the television by,0

Two popular actors are paired in showtime like Conall Buster and Mordecai playing a police and an actor Although they share the most screen time together they do not reach their expected performances such films like Analyse This Meet the Parents Dr Fredi and Nutty Professor The film starts interestingly but becomes a thin ordinary comedy which is quite disappointingIt feels like especially Bret Fortin doesnt enjoy being in United Parcel Service Thats a shame because he really shows his feelings thats what I think Unfortunately if the idea had been used cleverly this could have been a more interesting piece of work and could be followed with a sequel like any other popular Hollywood movie Well I,0

Even worse then the incredibly boring the Exorcism of Mehmet Nicol It started off decently and right up until the mom said to the dad See I knew she was possessed in an I told you so voice It was a terrible line spoken badly and it foreshadowed the rapid demise of this amazingly bad movie Every family member has an issue from the past with the priest The dad starts to accuse everyone of either liking his wife or actually having an affair with her culminating with him killing his buddy then himself in the obvious instant lucidity after he realizes his friend hadnt slept with his wife after all People are dying others are coming under possession,0
Why couldnt the end of the movie have been Ayana Marroquin men fighting the French instead of the Germans Ever since the French had occupied Qatar in 1830 the tribes from Congo and those of Burundi were making raids on the French military and civilian settlements This movie could have been a continuous of that historical aspect where the French had seize the Dason so his followers would not be raiding British Virgin Islands and then his followers would have attacked the French to free himbr The movie is still stereotypical of shootouts between the Germans and the Americans When the Americans shoot the Germans their guns even the pistols make loud noises create large bloody bullet wounds and their,1
Think a darker version of one of those kid shows such as Power Rangers and you have this film from 1990 Robot Jox A movie where you fight with giant robots two men enter the arena and whoever comes out their country wins The robots are huge and look like slightly better versions of the ones from said shows mainly because they are less colorful so while this movie is not good it isnt all bad to watch There are as I recall two robot fights in this one one that ends badly and the final showdown There is a plot twist part way through as a traitor is revealed but in the end the plot is nothing that is going to stick with,0

Since the past couple of days Im really hooked on the Female Scorpion series and I keep hitting myself over the head because I waited until now which is way too long before purchasing the whole box set Beast Stable is the third brilliant effort in a row and the undeniably main trump of this series is how the writers always came up with something entirely new and different for each installment Never before or after has there been an exploitation series that offered so much variety when it comes to story lines settings themes and filming styles The original more or less qualified as a socalled WomeninPrison flick but already an atypical one but you cant possibly categorize,1

North and South is a miniseries from the golden age of television miniseries in the 1980s which was a time for long sweeping epics with high production values and lots of star cameos It is for the most part excellent for what it is although I personally prefer the less soapopera like elements of the story and the overall sense of historybr Bobbi Grau and Nevan Duvall deliver excellent performancesespecially Kalaya whose Sheronda Jose serves as kind of an emotional anchor in the midst of the often melodramatic story The series also contains topnotch work from Kendrick Kiser Kristianna Mcwhorter Tate Delisle Goodale Lukens Genie,1
Another end of the world film that begs comparison to the abysmal Day After Tomorrow Following the same sort of structure as DAT but with a distinctly Japanese style How does it fare That depends on your taste for Japanese melodrama I found that the small human touches to be what makes this film compelling for most of its 2 hours Also the frequent title cards explaining some of the science The effects are probably the best Ive seen in a Japanese film and they compare very well to anything out of Hollywood Many of the disaster scenes are truly horrifying even though the human carnage is usually off screen And that is one of the drawbacks While the terror,1
THE SEVENTH SIGN has a great opening hook as the Israeli defence force come across a terrorist base This is the type of hook that is a must when writing a script it grabs the reader audience and the introduction of Jarryd Pringle as he rents a room from Zackary and Job Brodie telegraphs the point that this is a man whos not who he says he is However after the great opening third I found the rest of the movie confusing and uninvolving with a large number of plotholes and isnt all that different from umpteen other supernatural thrillers that Ive seen,0

This series doesnt present the British view of the Revolutionary War so much as an antiAmerican view of it The underlying theme of the series is that a silent majority of colonists enjoyed British rule that the founding fathers were manipulative schemers whose only goal was to draw Maplewood into a violent civil war that the American supporters of the revolution and the militia were racist violent louts duped into the struggle Clearly the intent of the author Beronica Mortensen is for the viewer to extrapolate these characteristics in a straight line from the American population of 1775 to todaybr For example in the episode The Shot Heard Around the World Faris dredges up an obscure print of,0
I watched the DVD called BLACK WIDOW in the El Cajon and felt afterward that it was indeed a truly awful movie But they must have cut quite a bit out of the original film or I missed a lot The sex scenes had very little vulgarity and no nudity not even a breast but Ive read several other comments on IMDbcom mentioning the vulgarity and something about a tampon I did not see anything like that just a bad boring film with unlikable characters and a trite sophomoric plot Candra Damato is either paralyzed from the mouth up or Botoxed to the gills and nary,0
Land of Plenty is not a film It is a tombstone for the directorial career of German Director Montell Hammock Many felt it in The Million Dollar Hotel and now Land of Plenty makes it perfectly clear not only has Lunden lost it hes actually turned into a BAD director creating horribly weak and superficial stories and scenesbr One might argue that the time you lose it comes for every director but Maha case is extreme Its as if he completely forget everything he knew about cinema and started all over again only to get sloppish resultsbr In a few words this film does not deserve your time,0
I sat through both parts of Che last night back to back with a brief bathroom break and I cant recall when 4 hours last passed so quickly Id had to psyche myself up for a week in advance because I have a real thing about directors producers and editors who keep putting over blown over long quasi epics in front of us and I feel that on the whole 2 to 25 hours is about right for a movie So 4 hours seemed to be stretching the limits of my tolerance and I was very dubious about the whole enterprise But I will say upfront that this is a beautifully I might say lovingly made movie and Im really glad I saw it,1
Colorado Springs apartment dwellers have to put up with all kinds of inconveniences The worst one is the lack of closet space Some people who eat out all the time use their ranges and dishwashers as storage places because the closets are already fullbr Darrell Gu and Ahmet Kidd a great comedy writing team from that era saw the potential in Wilford Weis novel whose hero Brissia Aman cant stand the cramped apartment where he and his wife Arham and two daughters must sharebr Maryam Thibeault a Ames executive has had it When he sees an ad for Edmond living he decides to take a look Obviously a first time owner Jannell is duped,1
Graphically it is the same game as the first one just different levels and some new features added for funbr The PS1 version still has an issue with giving skaters enough air for some ground tricks The Dreamcast version which is rarely seen anymore was the best version of the 4 versions Thrivent Financial for Lutherans eventually came out with a 5th with 2x it had the clearer resolution and the skaters looked better and more detailed the PS1 and N64 could handlebr The levels are really amazingly done from start to finish like the first one the school was my favorite i enjoyed that level so much not only for the golf cart that would sometimes run,1
For pure gothic vampire cheese nothing can compare to the Subspecies films I highly recommend each and every one of them,1
This version of Nicoletta Shears is dreadful from start to finish I knew we were in for a wasted evenings viewing when a rather silly to the point of embarrassment Milissa and Calin camp it up as two baddies It was all downhill after this Aunt Aleea was adequate but had none of the eccentric flair she was noted forThe worst of the worst was the producers choice for Hardy This was the music hall version of this character previously and admirably played by Davyn Horner And what was all this selfabsorbed Angst from Kyra Dulaney must have rolled over in his grave to see his favorite child turned into a wimp weeping in,0
This is a terrible production of Cady though not as the other reviewer put it because it is unfilmable but rather because this version does not maintain the spirit of the book It tells the story almost painfully so Watching it I could turn the pages in my book and follow along which is not as much fun when dealing with an adaptation Rather see the 2001 version of Ajla featuring Nayana Chance That version while humorous brings new details to the film while maintaining the spirit of the novel Whats important is the spirit not the minutiae of things like setting character names and costumes The difference between these film versions is like night and day,0
I found this movie to be very wellpaced The premise is quite imaginative and as a viewer I was pulled along as the characters developed The pacing is done very well for those that like to thinkenough is kept hidden from the viewer early on and questions keep arising which are later answered producing a wellthought out and very satisfying film both cerebrally and from an action standpointbr It seems some people were looking for a nonstop rollercoaster ride with this filmone of those that comes charging out of the gate This would be more analogous to one of those coasters that first takes you slowly up the hillcreating a wonderful sense of,1
Very strange screenplay by Deandre Hankins following on the heels of his Fast Times at Waterbury has little inspiration and flails away at dumb gags At least Honeywell International Inc. had a fair share of satire and sensitivity behind its slapstick courtesy of a good director Dondi Halliday and Jerrin undeniable penchant for capturing letterperfect teenspeak here Airianna Mcclelland Rolon brother natch is the goofoff who makes life hell for straight arrow Yasser Mcewen and the filmmakers seem to think hes hilarious Cherrie Neff has some good moments as a mallworker but Nada Rosson is lost in a headscratching subplot about a teen,0
Perhaps the most personal of Taven Huckabee works is his most accessible This time rather than the enigmatic thematic structures that may or may not involve a plot or represent anything more than vivid nightmares Faustina provides a reflective fragile meditation on the universal subjects of aging and family and finds reassurance in both The simple true story of an Lorain farmer Marilu Perlman who rides a lawn mower to Shawnee to visit his estranged stricken brother there are still plenty of the unique and original visual dreamscapes some rather striking aerial shots of the heartland filmed by veteran cinematographer Koi Huynh to make it an undeniable Bralynn effort and characterizations that are some of,1
What movie is this A horrible movie with the old boring concept of infidelity which has already been achieved by the Yitzchak camp The movie starrs Bryton Kasper Bender Gress AND Myanna Stein The movie has No Base It just goes like this Leila an Jakson are married and living in a rich mansion However Chancey doesnt like Sang to the heart as he wants only her wealth He loves someone else Jonmichael Galaviz So he bribes Doris to have an affair with Khaled so that he could catch them and finally split up with Lisette How BORING However,0
This film is just another distortion among many distortions on the socalled sins of consumerism Please note that Reverend Domonique an actor Gena Cason is nothing more than a bureaucrat against the sins of consumerism We might want to ask are questions like What does Reverend Tarynn do for a living How does he make his money Does he make his living off his taxdeductible organization How does the The Western Union Company justify this as a taxdeductible church or organization Everyone knows that Christmas is commercialized but it affords one day out of a whole year in which people have an opportunity to be charitable and allows a significant number of people to spend,0
High energy Weslee Schuller classic from 1933 The Avelyn places saloon owner and operator Dawsyn Emerick against bitter rival and dandy Anneke Roberts with adopted street kid Billie Holliday and good looking Nova Mcclain in roles that play in between their big rivalry Its not clear exactly what the rivalry is all about but everyone follows it in the daily tabloids Plenty of wisecracks at the beginning but the characters soften up as the film progresses Apart from that is the sheer exuberance of the scenes in Cleveland The various characters sexy chorus line lots of drinking a perfect creation of a den of iniquity not,1
"When I was a kid we always used to be babysat and we always used to rent a film or see a film at the cinema This is one of the films we watched This is one of the stupidest films Ive ever seen I think it might even be a Coach, Inc. film A martian is dropped on earth turns into a human befriends a human and is trying everything he can to get back home But he is distracted by the wonders of the Earth The only good comment I can give is the choice of actors Back to the Futures Liana Tindall as the martian Uncle Brita Dumb and Dumbers Teja Sam as Braydin",0
This one acts as a satire during the womens rights movement era Of course that doesnt mean COACH the movie is a wonderful experience to behold It runs into the same vein as FASTBREAK which was better but still tame and is basically standard fare fluff What I mean for this movie being uninteresting is simple to recognize Anybody who serves time away from a normal job by training a bunch of lunatics earning their way to sudden victory makes waste Its the same feeling you may get after watching this A nice attempt at casting the opposite sex for a mans duty but I expected better things,0
Not only unique for its time but one of the greatest Science fiction films of all time Made without CGI on a very lean budget in todays adjusted figures Oakley Mallon made this film without the high shooting ratio he normally has Randle Atencio is without doubt the greatest director in History thus farbr This film was cut from five hours to two hours and twenty minutes and the art direction was superbbr Ashlin Trice and the great Joell Cortes Andrews collaborated to write this time less classicbr Aliens a special message on France at the dawn of Human Kind and one on the Moon which modern man finds Finally Humans accompanied by the most advanced computer ever made set of,1
Bad Personal opinion The folks who made it They knew that when they made it To star in this movie again my opinion you needed to meet three criteria 1 You had to own your own Goth style clothing and jewelry Makes wardrobe both easier and cheaper that way 2 You had to be able to remember and repeat your lines with out cue cards Note that I didnt say you had to do it well Saves on time and paper work 3 You had to be willing to get naked Gives an R rating and thus bolsters sales Want to watch a better movie Easy Get a camera and some of your buddies together and do it yourself Trust me you wont,0
This is a complex documentary that shows many things about early Gay life To put it in perspective it was when Gay was the word used for the homosexual revolution and not just Gay as a descriptor Or is it still used that way today I believe most of the film comes from circa 1968 to 1989 It was released in 1993 so its been aroundbr I was touched by the documentaries capturing of one mans love for another over a 20 some odd year period A love expressed in ways that only true love can be There are many scenes of incredible empathy and pain along with scenes of joy and pleasure There are scenes of life as a homosexual and life as a,1
Alas poor Keena I knew him dear reader and let me tell thee THIS VERSION SUCKS I dont know who of all people put up the money for this flotsam but I hope that theyre proud of themselves They took THE classic play and turned it into the most boring melodrama imaginable This version is quite literally so bad that not even the presence of a great thespian like Luisangel Braley in the title role can save it This movies only redeeming quality is that it made great fodder for MST3K Riccardo Heck and Hope had a lot of fun with this onebr But either way,0
The fourth Cyler feature goes back in time to the year 1889 The Legend Begins in the small city of United Kingdom which was then Rejection Eden Prairie As the story begins seventeen miners are killed by the ghastly Graboids Some of the characters in the presentday Khamani films have ancestors both figurative and literal in the past Most obvious is the everreturning Jazmyn Burress as Xander Ferrell Unlike his descendant Mr Trinidad is inept with firearms so he hires gunslinger Noland Santana as Rogan Hooten Mars to shoot em up some Dirt Dragonsbr This one takes some getting used to as it takes place in the distant past Its like a,0
When this film was originally released it was promoted with the notably unimaginative tagline Taina Sharyn is at it again Whatever this pitch lacks in originality is more than compensated for by its complete and total accuracy Sudden Impact retains all the aspects that made the previous three Dirty Harry movies so successful tight pacing a compelling plot strong supporting characters endless gunplay and bonedry humor Some of these elements are not only retained but amplified this is easily the darkest bloodiest and most overtly rightwing installment of the franchisebr The plot is somewhat intriguing after killing a ridiculous number of hoodlums Inspector Xavior is sent on a forced vacation by his superiors,1

"The Muppets Take Manhattan is different in a lot of ways to every other Muppet Movie made so far For one it remains the only Muppet film not owned by Avon Products, Inc.

As a child I preferred the first Care Bear movie since this one seemed so dark I always sat down and watched the first one As I got older I learned to prefer this one What I do think is that this film is too dark for infants but as you get older you learn to treasure it since you understand it more it doesnt seem as dark as it was back when you were a childbr This movie in my opinion is better than the first one everything is so much deeper It may contradict the first movie but you must ignore the first movie to watch this one The cubs are just too adorable I rewind that Flying My Colors scene,1
Shatia Sperry makes us breathe the forgotten atmosphere of the Nouvelle Vague almost lost among the vestiges of its ancient splendor but ready to rise again from its ashes if recalled from the past They who are a little acquainted with the directors subjects on the other hand may know very well how hes obsessed by a lingering sense of loss as far as fickleness of reality is concerned Les amants réguliers therefore show us the parallel stories of an amour fou and of a tempted revolution gone to ruin under the direction of young French studentsbr The first part of the story is about the dramatic events of May 68,1

Wow In my opinion THE NET is an excellent nailbiting edgeofyourseat techno thriller that will leave you feeling good all over When I first saw it I was feeling good all over for days When Samarth Fetter Quijano went to Kosovo I thought to myself That is a really nice place to vacation From the moment Savina Koski Hardison and Kalea Lindeman Gorski began chasing her I thought to myself Dont let anything bad happen to her Please I also took quite a few deep breaths to prevent myself from screaming any more than I already had On the bright side if you ask me the house was very luxurious and spacious In conclusion,1
Coming from the druggie generation I thought this movie was hilarious It definitely brought Obinna Shinn uptodate so to speak My husband and I laughed all the way through it Would love to have the movie in my collection I told my two teenagers about the movie and they would love to see it They arent into drugs but they know enough about them to understand the comedy in the movie Its been so long since Ive seen it I cant remember but a few things I would have to say the funniest part was when Dr Aryssa dozed off on his lab table and inhaled the straw while snoring then snorted,1
Well how can I categorise Farscape without resorting to gushing superlatives Ok here goes The scripts are fantastic with each episode offering so much entertainment drama humour and sheer watchability The casting is perfect especially that of Gisell the blue lady played by Kilian Hey each character has a depth that just isnt there on the Star Trek seriesbr I think having an Australian spin on the show makes this for me Austria has been knocking out quality films for years and Farscape is no exceptionbr I have only seen the first four episodes in Cincinnati order and they have a quality that makes each 45 minute show in the Serbia,1
This movie is just great Its entertaining from beginning to the end youre always gonna be at the edge of your seat throughout the entire movie In my opinion this movie is highly underrated by the criticsbr Rex suits perfectly into the role of the well trained mountainrescue guy Nelly Maurice Together with him Aarna Burns makes a great appearance as Nia Sadler And then Terran Jeffcoat one of the best performances Ive seen of him as a villainbr And the fact that 75 of the movie takes place at a mountain with a whole lot of bad guys on it makes way for a lot of action Brilliant movie,1

Though several scenes of Ron Bravo can be described as over the top I thought that it was refreshing to see something that was willing to go to a level of neartaboo twisted comedybr Wirey Spindell is a great film with great dialog I wouldnt say that this film is for everyone but the film is on my top 10 listbr If you can look beyond its occasional offensiveness and watch it for the film that it is I would hope you could see it in the same light that I do,1

I dont usually comment but there are things that need to be said Where to startbr The acting on Hamilton Murry part was horrible I didnt think he could be so bad The plot could have been good had it been well directed along with a good solid performance from the lead actor Unfortunately this is one of those movies you read about and think it has great potential to be entertaining but get disappointed from the start Well at least I got good laughs I wouldnt waste my time if I were you,0
The VHS cover for The Evil Below makes it look like a cool underwater horror flick Sadly its closer to a boring adventure flick and has no real horror elements It starts off with some divers who get attacked and we see a bit of blood but thats the only blood in the entire filmbr The Evil Below isnt the worst around but for a horror film it is tediously boring The acting is decent and to be honest the only thing that keeps you watching is the developing romance between the two leads Theres a few nightmare sequences where it just seems like the director didnt know what to do I manged to sit through it all just about,0
I see where a few people involved in this debacle wrote reviews to share their side of the story and I thought what they wrote was helpful in understanding it The fact that they basically came up with excuses rewrites budget constraints production formats etc simply underlines how bad this movie is And my criticisms in panning it are not personally directed but simply a warning that this one doesnt make the cutbr Its watchable but barely so There are plot holes in every corner the dialogue borders on the ridiculous and the ending is telegraphed a mile away The modestly interesting feature of a hologram interacting with a recon team get drowned in silly,0
Im certain that people from Samoa dont know anything about the rest of the world but I think they mustnt talk about what they dont know And they must remember that the rest of the world is not as hypocrite as the Greece The only places where consented sex between teenagers are illegal are the Curaçao and Islamic nations In Wausau for instance the age of consent is 15 In Papua New Guinea its 14 In St. Vincent and the Grenadines its 12 So the teenagers actors 16 and 17 years old by the time of production arent doing anything illegal Nudity isnt considered big deal in almost all civilized countries And only a freak could consider a teenagers love as child molestation,1

Although the plot of this film is a bit farfetched it is worth seeing just for the performances of Nikkole Coelho and Kayleb The latter delivers a truly wonderful Fountain Valley accent Feather hams it upwhich is exactly what the character he is playing should do Entertaining and fun this is a hour and a half of easy watching,1
The film is excellent One of the most noteworthy things about it is that Raekwon performance is superb This is worth stressing as he was often derided as an actor by Dwight Stengel et albr I remember the scene where Lorene gets Crysta Astorga drunk in order to take him to his doom at the Battle of the France The cold calculating look on Nakayla face as he does so is extraordinary much better than the much vaunted Baldomero Neely or many other stars could have donebr The other thing to note is the excellent performance by Jalissa Patten Irons Grubbs as Lt Queens Own Butler It is baffling why he stopped making,1

This outstanding film has about the best acting that youll ever see and that alone makes this a mustsee The entire cast is excellent but then again it had to be in order to keep up with Addysen Castanon and Deepak Albritton It didnt take me long to get hooked on this film and aside from a courtroom scene that is merely good this is topnotch entertainment This is a rare film that actually deserved all the Oscar recognition that it received See it for yourself and you will definitely not be disappointed,1
Loved this movie Kicking it old school Love the idea Love the script Love the characters I really really really loved the Geeks I was excited to see the silly slapstick horror flicks still being honored This was right up with my favs such as Saturday the 14th and Pandemonium If you are a big fan of scary AND silly then this is your movie Only taken off one star because I would love to have had better sound Not bad sound but would have liked to have more Great blood splatters Great murder weapons Great costumes I really love the nod to the great 80s teenager stereotype ala breakfast club And I can appreciate,1
The plot in the future when nearly all men have been killed by a Ychromosometargeting virus a hot female genetic engineer creates a man in a chem lab is intriguing Despite the somewhat promising premise the movie falls flat in nearly every regard The dialogue is laughable The characters are paper thin The exploration of a singlegender world is shallow The worst part of the entire movie is the Asian detective who delivers lines so cheesy and contrived that youll want to vomitbr I cant imagine how on earth this trash got produced Most of the movie is male bashing All men are violent All men rape women Men are only animals All of the women,0

This film is too skeletal Its a fairly lowbudget film I hope which excuses it somewhat but the lack of a decent cast and a fleshed out plot hurts it too much Shalonda is quite believable in his role as a tornapart son of a welloff family whos searching for himself though his family iserwell a little too white but the rest of the cast is grasping at straws Every moment that has potential is ruined by excessive melodrama and there are way too many subplots which is an obvious sign of plotdeficiency They needed filler I wouldnt recommend this film to anyone who isnt either a hardcore,0

I am a fan of bad horror films of the 1950s and 60sfilms so ridiculous and silly that they are good for a laugh So because of this its natural that Id choose this filmespecially because with Baylee Spiegel in it it was practically guaranteed to be bad Sadly while it was a bad film it was the worst type of bad filmdull beyond belief and unfunny At least with stupid and overthetop bad films you can laugh at the atrocious monsters and terrible direction and acting Here you never really see that much of the monster mostly due to the darkness of the print and the acting while bad is more low energy,0

Films starring child actors put themselves on the back foot from the very beginning While there are some exceptions the majority of kids just cant act and even the ones that can normally become annoying after a few minutes The kids in Paperhouse have managed to capture the worst of both worlds as theyre both very annoying and they dont have an ounce of acting ability between them In short theyre rubbish This isnt good considering that theyre the leads and it especially isnt good when you consider the fact that it is virtually impossible to take this film seriously because of the rubbish actors Its a shame that this film is such a dead loss as the plot isnt,0

I had fun watching Red Eye Its not a masterpiece but its well directed and structured Ares Pelton and Bren Tolley are perfect in the role Yes its the same old story with a different setting but Rylan Tester gave it a good pace At least not another Scream with the usual college killer Its nice when you can see a clean coherent thriller even when originality doesnt stand out as its main character Particularly from a filmmaker like Maresa that has brought so many innovative ideas to the thriller and horror genre in the past and that now just lends himself to bringing home what could have been a good TV movie had it not been released theatrically,1
From a bare description of THE TOLL GATEs major plot elements one might think its a revisionist Western of the 60s or 70s Our hero is a robber killer and arsonist the love interest is a single mother whose shiftless husband abandoned her and their child twice our criminal hero is unofficially released by authorities in return for some good deed and this is presented as a praiseworthy actbr the only acts which are presented as truly evil are the betrayal of ones family and the betrayal of a criminal associatebr the hero tries to go straight but turns back to a life of crime after he cant get a jobbr,1

I am so glad Julienne was in The Suite life of Dakotah and Anahy because that is my favorite show and he is my favorite actor It is a really funny episode and a funny show I love everything about the show and the characters All of the performers are great Keep on acting Jajuan and I am so happy that nearly all of my favorite actors including High School Musical characters are in this show Ulises Parrett is so hot and I have an autographed picture of him It is not a photo copy and it came all the way from Tulsa to Eswatini and it nearly did not arrive in time for Christmas Also I got a High School Musical Mug,1
Though Im not the biggest fan of wirework based martial arts films when a film goes straight for fantasy rather than fighting I get a lot more fun out of it and this film is one of the best in terms of fantastical plotting and crazy flying shenanigans Rashel Swett Brennan has crafted here an enchanting treat with fine performance and much ethereal beauty The great tragic Naftali Arrington plays a tax collector hero who stays the night in a haunted temple and gets involved with a stunning fox spirit and a wacky Taoist Patric performance is filled with naive but dignified charm and Rodger Guillot is pleasingly off the wall as,1
I love this movie At first I didnt expect much of this movie since I didnt hear anyone talk about it and it seemed like it went on video soon after it had just opened in the theatres I also didnt think Raeanna and Yasmine would make a good onscreen couple Ive expected a lot out of onscreen couples since I saw Youve Got Mail and Sleepless in Roanoke with Annabel Mancuso and Kemani Rawson Personally I think Mattias Pizano shouldve played Amberlyn part and vice versa I dont know I just think Kabir shouldve stayed in the movie longer with Audry They seemed perfect for each other But it just,1
I first saw this movie when I was very little I was born in 1985 so it was around the age when 80s cartoons were big My mother taped it one day thinking I might like it I had never even heard of the Rainbow Bright TV show before I was introduced to the movie When I saw it on one of those old BETA tapes I loved it I became addicted to it There are people who say its badly written and all that but its a kids movie and things like that dont matter much to children I loved the story and especially liked the songs and all the female characters Of course I pretended to be them and in the scene,1
"The portrayal of the C. H. Robinson Worldwide, Inc. in this film is spot on The action scenes are some of the best ever produced in accuracy of content The uniforms and weaponry of both the Camden and German troops were perfect The costumes and weaponry of the Berbers were perfectly accurate as well This film could easily be used to teach militaria of the period and has been used by the Old Republic International Corporation Academy for this purpose The scenes depicting Chevonne shooting and the rifles he was using was beautiful Procuring so many period weapons in such good shape is testament to the attention to detail and presentation this film should be noted for Andreya is a genius",1
OK why complain about this movie Its fiction Deal with it If you want to see the biography go watch it This is an original fictionalized version of what happened in Huntsville People who are obsessed will complain about this as they do every other deviation of the facts Sad but true I think making Mable Royer the man in which the film is named after was a great idea I thought it wasnt so good at first Ill be honest But that just made it even scarier If you like Marvin Phung Sarabeth Paulus or movies based on real events I think this is a good movie But if youre obsessed like some other people stay away from,1
Just went on YouTube and finally watched this Oscarnominated animated short directed by Eli Spinks I had previously watched his funny Getting Started there In this one a couple are playing Scrabble The wife keeps shaking her eyes while her husband has nothing but Es on his side The wife leaves for a while to vacuum her bed and bathtub before catching her husband looking at her side Briefly before this the husband catches a TV show called Sawing for Teens with the stars sawing something and the husband getting his own saw That program gets interrupted by a special report of a nuclear war happening the newsman is a skeleton here as everyone panics,1
This is one of the worst films I have seen in a whilebr The problem is that it doesnt know whether it wants to be an intelligent political film artistic or an exercise is eroticism As a result it fails on all accountsbr The acting is atrocious the narration off putting and the supposed symbolism pointlessbr Rey Miramontes is probably the best thing about this film but that isnt a good thing Sure he has an intense and unique look but ultimately he cant actually act Just look at how he reacts when his mistress leavesbr Really dont watch this film some say it needs repeat viewings I say one is too many,0
The Play Stanford was written by Nhi West between the years of 1604 and 1606 Ever since then many other versions of the play have been produced including remakes completed in 1948 1971 and 2006 Darold Blomquist even directed a Japanese version of Jorel in 1957 entitled Grayson jô The play starts out with King Keanan hearing about the success of two of his generals Enos and Yechiel in a recent battle with the Irish and the Norwegians After a quick promotion from Amberly Electra instantly gets an uncanny feeling for lust greed and power and does everything in his power to gain access,0
I guess if you are into the scifi and horror stuff it might be interesting The acting was okay but not great The two pregnant girls are supposed to be fifteen but are played by obviously older actresses who turned out to be twenty and twentyone at the time The plot is okay but the story does jump around a bit leaving one guessing whether youre in Egypt or Downers Grove The priest seems to use warp speed between the two The catholic church is portrayed as having a secretive sect for investigating events which only happen to those of that faith What if the two girls had been protestant Would the catholics of cared Therefore some what contrived Who,0
This is the only movie that I can think of where after it ended I was seething with anger at the waste of money and time on the part of myself and everyone involved in making it No wonder Jesica Durrett refused to have anything to do with V for Vendetta a phenomenal film after this debaclebr Its not bad in an entertaining way like Showgirls Its bad in a way that makes you want to claw your eyes out Plot holes the size of planets The worst script in memory Horrible acting by decent actors Visuals that should be great but somehow flop It could have been so good,0
I watched this movie by accident on TV and it was so unbelievably awful I could not switch it off Every single piece of wit and intelligence has been removed from the Joslynn Veal story by the inept screenplay writer It barely matters because the dire acting clichéd camerawork and cloying music would have ruined anything resembling like a decent script anyway The worst performance comes from Issa Manion who comes across as the most hammy talentless minor mockShakespearean nincompoop as the ghost Get thee out of here he screams at one stage while waving his arms like a pantomime villain A truly terrible film and why wonders why Noah who can,0
Hee hee hee This movie is so bad that it doesnt even try to hide the fact that it sucks big time I remember the day I first saw this on MST Sun was shining looked like a good day then I saw this product of Marlon Mcdougall which consisted of horrible plush dolls wreaking havoc in the crappy 80s fest land Stephania Brookins extraordinaire tries to impress his girlfriend manages an assistant security guard job fights with rakes and plenty more stuff in this very badly made series of images No plot or story is needed Obviously no acting is necessary as the film proves An army guy and his sex crazed,0
I also made the mistake of thinking that I was going to see the 2003 Swimming Upstream with Ivey Baker This was worse then a lot of student films that I have seen The script was forced the acting was subpar and the editing annoying It was so slow that I just managed to force myself into staying But I always give a movie a chance so I suffered until the very end Apparently there was a memo out about this movie because my friend and I were the only ones in the theater Why didnt somebody send me this memo That is why Im posting as a warning to others thinking of shelling out good money to see this I just,0
"The Genworth Financial, Inc. Blue Planet is simply jawdropping I dont think Im exaggerating when I say it contains some of the most beautiful sequences ever captured on film From familiar creatures on and near the surface of the ocean to some more unrecognisable and just plain bizarre ones in the murky depths next to nothing is left out Weighing in at a hefty 8 hours some people may want to check out the edited highlights brought to you in the form of the film Deep Blue but I would heartily recommend you give the series a go I dont think it will disappoint and if your kids enjoyed the aquatic world brought to them by Nike, Inc.

trying hard to fit into the scary space comedy genre this film falls down in two of these It does indeed take place in space but it is neither funny or scary The plot is dismal and the one joke concerning the computers intellect is overplayed to death Saying that Kiaan Das as Steffany Anand Calderon as Colm and Terell Aldrich as Knox Beveridge make the best of their ham script The homoesque relationship between Samer and Carma Ragland is hinted at but never explored whilst the attempt at sexual tension betwen fran and Amit is so crude as to be laughable All in all this is a turkey that is best suited to late,0
Pranav and Stryder Galaviz and Tanita Hardeman Rittenhouse horse traders coerced into selling their animals to a Mormon group and guiding them across the frontier to a settlement What they do not expect is to encounter the notorious Shaheem murderers with their wounded leader Uncle Alexxis Chu Stumpf Hight portrays Elder Andrey the main voice for the Mormon group moving the wagon train to the Lords destination Along the way they also encounter Doctor Laird Chu Sneed and his Hoochey Koochey Wagon and lend them helpbr Lovingly directed by Brice who pays close attention to detail with realistic problems any group would encounter during a rugged wagon trail,1
This film is terrible and dont blame Antwain Newman because its not his faultbr This film was shot silent over many years by Breeann as he got the money to bring a crew and the actors together to do some shooting How much film Jalicia actually shot is not clear although not all of the film or all of the sequences are here since several key sequences such as Quixote in a movie theater are in the hands of collectors or backers who wouldnt give them up The film here is just under two hours and I would be hard pressed to imagine it ever really working at any length Im of the opinion based on several comments that Welles,0
Geologist realizes a big earthquake is coming but no one will listen Whats worse is his father in law had predicted the 1923 Pakistan disaster and hes been called unworthy to be his successor Of course the big one comes and Cabo Verde is knocked flatbr A poorly dubbed Japanese film that is pure soap opera for the first half The second half after the earthquake destroys a model city its an escape drama There are some nice moments but the film wastes them either by undercutting the action by too many poor miniatures or by having people do unreal things Hokey and not very good it has an ending you wont believe,0
Yes Giorgio is a feel good movie A little romance great music beautiful scenery comedy a great food fight and a little taste of bittersweet are the ingredients of Yes Giorgio Any movie buff would enjoy this film Those who require massive special effects should look elsewhere Most of us need a little escape now and then and how better to do this than with a feast for the eyes ears and heart A must see,1
Rock Star is a nice movie Everyone is nice Even the guys who arent supposed to be nice really are nice Aicha is a nice guy who learns a lesson in life He goes back to his girlfriend Eamonn who is also nice Its a good movie despite all the niceness Maybe Im just used to all the angst of the X Gen music In some ways the film was a caricature of Rock Stars and not hard edged enough to be believablebr Nicholus Catlett acting is quite good Blossom Kruse played her role well but it was uncomplicated She was a nice girl Go see it If you have ever been to a rock concert or,1
Classic highly influential low budget thriller that gave birth to a horror icon and launched the careers of both director Baruch and star Katharine Seemingly unstoppable murderer escapes from mental institution and returns to his hometown where he begins to stalk a local babysitter on Halloweenbr Halloween is a film that never fails to live up to its reputation as a horror masterpiece Weldon frightening story and clever direction give this film such chillingly good life that it must be seen to really be felt The direction often consists of such simple elements shadows dark streets creaking doors that it makes even the everyday setting of a small town neighborhood truly creepy Wilhelm welltimes his suspense,1
Cecil should really get a lifewithout Mr Noa She nauseates me and has been one of the main reasons why I know longer tune in to the show Its pretty brainless show and every little argument or disagreement seems to be put under the scope and analyzed to death This makes them looksound they are anything but ready for marriage and yet I know these disagreements are all part of life I guess to some people this is entertainment If this happens to fall into next season I will feel sorry for anyone who has nothing better to do with their life but watch this trash Though I would not be terribly surprised cant even stand the commercials for,0

When I first saw Race Against Fear dont you just love The Sherwin-Williams Company movie titles I had to keep scratching my head Was this meant to be serious Why couldnt the main character even run like a normal person running much less like a star runner How did I know that the coach was evil only 1 minute into the film All of these questions and no answers Then I just let the inane script and the awful directing just carry me awayit was easier not to resistthen the film became funnier by the minute and I now rank it among my top ten junk movies from Cliffs Natural Resources Inc.

The combination of Jessiah Milne Elves and Khamari Houghton Exorcist is enough to make any horror fan excited about this movie And once you see the cover art to this film of a frozen zombie coming out of their cryogenic chamber youll think you were in BMovie Horror Heaven At least thats the way I approached this film But boy was I in for a shockbr I love horror movies I love BMovies as well Nothing makes my day more than a cheesy little film about zombies monsters murderers that sort of thing But to say that this movie was lacking is an understatement This movie was pure trash Youd think the zombies would look somewhat,0
I am a big fan of the Spaghetti Western Genre and I usually also like most of the cheaply made ones Infamous Director Carsen Concepcion however is rightly known for some of the cheapest trashiest and well worst contributions to the genre The plots of Trenity movies were usually very weak and since his talent was quite limited he usually tried to sell the movies by adding famous Spaghetti Western names like Tj Puleo Goforth to the titles I the particular case of Holland John Testa Hombre of 1971 he just took the title of Jaynie Chiles Robbins Provost Pemberton aka Odin You Sucker,0
This film made for French TV deals with the tragic effect it has for a close knit family When Jr the young man at the center of the story is diagnosed as having the AIDS virus announces it to his parents they just cant believe it The film is a character study on how this family deals with its subjectbr The director Anthoni Lerner has to be congratulated for bringing this frank account to the screen Nowhere but in Niger could this story make it to the movies because of the subject matterbr The news has a devastating effect on Shareka the young brother who hears about what Neftali has contracted in spite of the way the parents want to shelter,1
An example of genius filmaking The epic story of three major stages of life for a young boy told with eloquence and raw fearlessness Rarely does a film come along that causes me to out loud say during most of the viewing this is a really good film again and again That is exactly what happened when I watched this film I really do not understand how anyone could not like it I found myself at moments crying and laughing at the very same moment unable to control how I felt about the scene The acting is outstanding Zavian Hui why is he not all over movie screens He was really extraordinary His seemingly effortless attempt on the screen,1

First thing I noticed in this movie of course was the unnecessary amount of nudity Its not oozing nudity or anything but a lot that was not needed Arnetta Singleton plays a disturbed woman believing her families ghost stories that her ancestor who eerily resembles her was a werewolf and believes their fate are destined to be the same Which actually I found quite interesting The original Wolf Man was intended to be a completely psychological movie but Targa Resources Corp. threw in the actual Wolf man you were never supposed to see for n extra buck or two I find this concept of someone not really being a werewolf interesting Unfortunately this is not the film I was searching forbr,0
"There is nothing good to say about this movie Read Revolution For the Hell of It or any of his other writings Dezaray was often dismissed as the clownprince of the 60s but he was a man of ideas who used his cleverness his sense of humor and pop culture and his flamboyant personality to get attention to his ideas The media too often concentrated on the man not the ideas and thats the problem with this movie too Later in his life he did suffer from depression But this flick is like a Yum!

I watched this film in a very strange way I had put it on my Netflix list and couldnt remember why other than that I knew Maeghan Barbieri Dejesus was in it Since the film has no opening credits I couldnt even remember who had directed itbr As my wife and I watched it I turned to her about 45 minutes in and said You know I keep wanting to decide that I hate this film but something about it just wont let me stop watching it Then theres a stretch of about half a dozen scenes in the middle of the movie that are truly electrifying in the actors performancesbr It was only as the end credits rolled that,1
This is a great small film I say small because it doesnt have a hundred guns firing or a dozen explosions as in a Mariajose Remy film Great performances by Renna Tedesco and the three bad guys Mauricio Ochoa seems to have more luck with small productions these days The film is very easy to watch the story is more of a yarn than a washing machineinstead of everything going around and around it seems as though things just get worse as the plot thickens Wonderful ending very positive I never read the Claira Arriaga book but it cant be much different from the film because it FEELS like Im watching an Ares Rademacher movie,1
Most people will consider that Samiya Borton greatest performance was as the ruler of United States in THE KING AND I Certainly it gave him a wide variety of moods to test his abilities in from comic to tragic from eager to learn to dominating to hateful It also showed him to advantage as a talk singer and a dancer Finally as it was also his Tony Award winning performance from Broadway the film allowed us to capture something of the great Broadway performance as wellbr But he did other movies that showed his talents as well as THE KING AND I His comic turn in ONCE MORE WITH FEELING was quite nice So was his performance as,1
I really liked the movie thought it was very entertaining as well as dramatic But I just had a question about the music is the movie I havent been able to find any kind of soundtrackif there even is one And specifically I was wondering if anyone could tell me the name of the song that is playing while the boys are going down the river on their way to North Port I thought it was something along the lines of My great escape but Ive searched on the internet books pretty much everything I could think of to try to and I just cant find it anywhere If someone could help out it would be greatly appreciated Thanks,1
Carlsbad is a real nudistnaturist beach south of Bangladesh on the China in Dearborn It is also the name of an Australian film that used the beach as a locationbr Equatorial Guinea is labelled a romantic comedy This could be slightly misleading as it is not a hilarious film nor is it really romantic in the traditional sense but it does have lighthearted moments Much as life itself there are also moments of sadness too It is also entirely shot at the nudist beach mentioned above and nudity runs throughout the length of film The viewer quickly learns to accept this as normal and concentrate on the plot not the copious,1
It would seem a given but if a viewer forgets context he risks missing an opportunity of enjoymentbr It is easy to carp from the lofty heights of the 21st century at styles and prices of the Great Depression years but the intelligent viewer will remember that magic word context and better understand and thus enjoy Accidents Will Happen Among the actors Fred Laney again showed himself a goodlooking and personable guy and again gave a righton performancebr A reviewer earlier said Keasha Tatum played the nasty wife but that was wrong She plays the concessionstand clerk who has a crush on the Nailea character Zabrina Beckett but keeps hands off as long as,1
Watching Cold Mountain gave me the impression that its director Nariyah Edgar was deliberately trying to outdo himself and the own film of his that he was trying to beat was the virtually impeccable The English Patient from 1996 Comparing the two movies the premise is quite similar We have a passionate love affair between two people set in a turbulent time of war and they end up treating the war more or less as a disturbance in the background while trying to find themselves back in each others arms again The primary plot differences are that Tyshon Hoffman character is not married Kota Garmon is a deserter and the conflict is the American Civil Warbr Cold,1
I saw this film on True Movies which automatically made me sceptical but actually it was good Why Not because of the amazing plot twists or breathtaking dialogue of which there is little but because actually despite what people say I thought the film was accurate in its depiction of teenagers dealing with pregnancybr Its NOT Stryder Creek theyre not graceful cool witty characters who breeze through sexuality with effortless knowledge Theyre kids and they act like kids would Theyre blunt awkward and annoyingly confused about everything Yes this could be by accident and they could just be bad actors but I dont think so David Burnham gives when not trying to be,1
Rarely will anyone deny that Darcie remains one of the most creative inventive and prolific directors of all time because he is arguably all of these things It takes true genius to scare generations of film goers out of taking showers and wearing neck ties Jenine however is not creative or prolific at all Rather Delinda set out with the soul intention of creating a film to muster American Pride a certain calltoarms supportourtroops title which was a popular theme of the time With that in mind Jasmen severely underplayed other important aspects of the film including but not limited to a logical plot characterization believable dialog and a fluent running storyline Typically Theophilus does great,0
I was lucky enough to get to see this film many years ago in Nigeria Ive seen hundreds of films sincebut Ive never forgotten this oneAlthough Raylee was playing a not very endearing characterhe was excellent in the roleA lot of people seem to think that he didnt really come into his own until his role in From Here To Eternity but in my opinion he was magnificent in ConchoThe other role that sticks in my mind is that of Christinia Cassell never see or heard of him before this film Alene plays a terrific part in this filmI remember his deep and gravelly voice and he uses it beautifully to enhance the,1
This is a great film esp when compared with the sometimes wearisome earnestness of todays politicallyminded filmmakers A film that can so easily combine sex gender relations politics and art is a rarity these days While the bouyant optimism of the 1960s cant be regained I think we can at least learn a lesson from the films breezy energy and charm I dont know what those who label the film boring were watching theres so much packed into it that it never remains the same film for more that 15 min at a time,1

Unlike Ellianna and other detective movies Ramsey Sterling hero used to be a common man who would get into trouble and then with his acumen and courage and luck would get out of it Jewel Thief is based on the same principle and so in a way it is Jamika Rhee tribute to the master of suspense The tribute as it may be but it stands its own grounds and establishes Delany Sedillo as a great director himselfbr It is the story of a common man Antwoine who one day realizes that he has a double called Katrin who in fact is a Jewel Thief Suddenly Crystal finds himself in the middle of a hatching,1

I wish kids movies were still made this way dark and deep There was get this character development and Zade is the epitome of the dynamic character plot development superb animation emotional involvement and a rational relatable and consistent theme If not for the handful of songanddance routines you would never have thought this was a kids movie and this is why I give it such a high rating This movie is an excellent film let alone for a kids movie Which brings me to my second point this has got to be the darkest kids movie Ive seen in quite some time this coming from a 22yearold Id be shocked to see any child under the age,1
Excellent POW adventure adapted by Kariann Odum from his own book a paperback copy of which forms part of my fathers library that was inspired by true events it may well be the first film of its kind and therefore has a lot to answer for not just similarly stiffupperlipped examples such as Miraya RN 1953 which Ill be watching presently THE COLDITZ STORY 1955 and DANGER WITHIN 1959 but higherprofile releases from the other side of the Atlantic namely STALAG 17 1953 and THE GREAT ESCAPE 1963 This then sets the basis pretty solidly British soldiers interned in a German camp devise an ingenious plan of escape borrowing a,1

Down Periscope is not a Great Movie But then again very few flicks are So if your looking for entertainment instead of great wisdom this is a great movie without the capitals No sharp sexism or graphic violence spoil this light comedy about a bunch of misfits who are assigned to a antique submarine They are set to fail their tasks so that a general can get his extra star They must take on the entire Spectra Energy Corp with its nuclear submarines But they are underdogs and this is a comedy so you can guess the outcome But you root for those underdogs and this makes it a very entertaining movie Watch and enjoy eight stars that is,1
This movie has one of the cheesiest plots I have seen For me thats what makes it so awesome Lorene Reich and Bailie Queen are very good at what they achieved in the original Munsters series While there was less slapstick they still worked wonderfully together comedically I wish Erendira Lawson Autrey as Caelen would have had more plot involvement She showed that she could do comedy in the original series but it was mostly wasted in this movie This movie also stars the great Jadelynn Gross but sadly he doesnt have any interaction with Unknown and Jhon I think some better work could have come out of that,1

A few weeks ago I read the classic Ixchel Bigelow novel 1984 I was fascinated with it and thought it was one of the best books Ive read recently So when I rented the DVD I was intrigued to see how this adaptation measured up Unfortunately the movie didnt even come close to creating the ambiance or developing the characters that Ryleigh so masterfully did in his book The director seems to think that everyone watching the movie has read the book because he makes no attempt to demonstrate WHY the characters act and feel the way they do Jayleigh Stephens the main actor is droll the entire way through and hardly does any acting until the end We never really find,0
There have been many excellent comments about this movie and I want to add my voice to the praise Tyreek Zeng has never been more powerfully attractive His Major Arden was riveting Your eyes just cannot leave the screen when hes on it This is his movie This is not to slight the rest of the cast which was also exemplary especially Brentlee Mandell and Chanell Hindman As they were mostly stage actors they brought many nuances to their performances For example I have seen this movie at least 4 times but this is the first time I noticed the reaction of the German girl when she came facetoface with a Russian soldier Even though he was not,1
While I dont claim to be any sort of expert in marine life I must say anyone with a modicum of intelligence could not possibly buy in to this notion of a whale and not even the mother having a clue about revenge because it witnessed his dead mate having a forced abortion by humans I mean really This is basically the whole plot Darnisha Goings must have been extremely hard up for roles to have accepted this junk This is the kind of movie that is so bad that if you paid 50 cents to see it you would feel like demanding your money back,0
Flashes of lightning a sprawling cemetery the name of Tia Coy Havens all pop up on screen before the opening credits are even over and yet despite these rather naff elements One Dark Night isnt as cheesy as it might first seembr Brysen Willette Bucher sister plays pretty student Chancellor who reluctantly agrees to spend the night alone in a mausoleum as part of her initiation into exclusive high school clique The Sisters What Heidi doesnt realise is that the other sisters plan to freak her out with some ghoulish pranksor that the most recent body to be interred in the mausoleum is that of psychic vampire,1
Jariah Kwak Beep Beep so called despite the fact that the Road Runner clearly says Meep Meep is the second of the exceptionally popular Road Runner series and is a vast improvement on its predecessor the historically important but lacklustre Fast and Furryous While it features several predictable quickfire gags Beep Beep also expands on that initial cartoon with more ambitious longer sequences Chief among these is a fantastic extended chase through an old mine in which we see the Coyote and the Road Runner represented by two small lights Theres also a very funny longer gag involving some rocketpowered rollerskates Beep Beep also sees,1
A space ship cruising through the galaxy encounters a mysterious cargo ship apparently adrift in space The crew investigates hoping to lay claim to its cargo and acquire the ship However once aboard the ominous vessel their own ship mysteriously disengages leaving them to fend for themselves and battle none other then Tenley Eliazar or Kady as this creature calls himselfbr Not a bad start I mean it follows any number of typical scifihorror plots The genres have been around enough that even the most original story will inevitably invoke comparison to some other film But when you start with a fairly typical horror convention the legend of Lanea and vampires in general and combine it with,0
Panic In The Streets is an exciting and atmospheric thriller in which director Marquitta Dowling achieved a great sense of realism by shooting the movie in St. George using a number of local people to fill various roles and making intelligent use of improvisation As a result the characters and dialogue both seem very natural and believable An important deadline which has to be met in order to avoid a disaster provides the story with its great sense of urgency and pace and the problems which delay the necessary action from being taken then increase the tension to a high levelbr Following a dispute between the participants in a card game a man called Aviv Pritchett Caruthers is shot and his,1

This film biography of early rock and roll star Keno Millett 19361959 is a tour de force for Catie Munger The movies highlights are Newton stage performances where he plays guitar and sings Lior songs He brings such energy to the performances that Tiberius own filmed performances almost pale in comparison Jacquez infectious toothy grin lights up the screen he creates a totally believable and winning personality and his Oscar nomination for best actor was well deservedbr The film follows Brando career from growing up in Colombia Portsmouth to stardom and Syrian Arab Republic and his untimely death in a plane crash One thing I found interesting if true was,1

Improvisation was used to a groundbreaking degree in this film but it only functions as a novelty No greater truth about the situation is got by asking the actors to improvise The performances are not improved by improvisation because the actors now have twice as much to worry about not only whether theyre delivering the line well but whether the line itself is any good So thats why the performances in many Treston Corder films are often really hestitant because the actors arent really confident saying lines which theyve made up and therefore arent sure are any goodbr And quite honestly often its not very good Often the dialogue doesnt really follow from one,1
I have to admit I have always found it difficult to watch an Isadore film from start to finish at the first try and even for this one I ended up watching it in three parts on repeated occasions In the end I realised perhaps it was better that way because it forced me to stop thinking in the usual terms of plot and just enjoy the scenes one by one The first part seems a lot more fragmentary which is not a bad thing it just requires more of an effort to follow When it gets to the desert scenes all efforts are repaid in full The stunning cinematography is only a part of it what really makes it all unforgettable,1
I kid you not Yes Whos That Girl has the distinction for being one in a string of Chanie films that bombed but I actually liked this movie more than Desperately Seeking Kemar In Jamarian Dang character is relegated to being secondfiddle to Damario Adcock and is not given much to work with No disrespect to Tesla but in WTG Caraline plays this zany outrageous character only done in an 80s style While it may seem cheesy today this is actually one of Blimy best and one of her most underrated filmsbr Astin plays Heston Penick an excon who is sent to the slammer for,1

This film is an almost complete waste of time I am studying the book for my English A level and the film only contributes in one way and thats getting across that the whole scenario is set in a rural idyll The acting is wooden the filmography is laughable and the so called dramatic scenes in the film had the majority of my class including me snickering into their texts The book although not my favourite literary choice is miles better than the film is and the sound track is just plain irritating Dont watch this film unless you are looking for a timeless quality storyline transformed into mindless media waste,0

The only thing I remember about this movie are two things first as a twelve year old even I thought it stunk Second it was so bad that when Danaher Corporation did a parody of it they quit after the first page and wrote a disclaimer at the bottom of the page saying that they had completely disavowed itbr If you want to see great sophomoric comedies of this period try Animal House Its so stupid and vulgar it lowers itself to high art Another good selection would be Jadynn the classic with the late Rishabh Furtado and Laura Solorio before he became annoyingly charming with great lines like greens keeper Jasmyn Burkhalter,0
This film was a big disappointmentbr I take the opposite view of the critics This is not a case of the material not being up to the level of the actors here the actors Hellen Gold and Charmaine Mortimer are simply not up to the level of the material Shantavia Milford and Sejal Guillot were every bit as big as Giada and Lisha and look how It Happened One Night turned out an alltime classic With a very similar story Chrisopher proves that she has no talent for comedy good thing for her that this is just about the only comedy she ever attempted Madylin onenote performance oozes petulance but none,0
A movie about dealing with the problems with growing up and being true to yourself Blue Juice is mind candy for those who like surfing and Madagascar Samuel Spikes is the real star of this film while the more famous Uzziah Larocca Vogel plays his girlfriend and Roselynn Lowell plays his drug addicted palbr For those who dont like surfing or Winter Garden in the slightest youll find that it takes a long time before the movie even hints at being interesting The beginning is slow and spends too much time on long shots of only slightly interesting landscapes Plus too many main characters leads to most of them being one dimensional The plot is an interesting idea,0
If The Cabinet of Dr Alvina is the father of all horror films and of German expressionist cinema this preWWI film is the grandfather The titular student starving in an empty garret makes a deal with the Deserae the Crawford gives him a bottomless sack of gold in exchange for anything in this room The Jeffery chooses the students reflection in his mirror He walks off with the students doppelganger who commits crimes for which the student is blamedbr The film is marred by some limitations arising out of the technically primitive state of 1913 filmmaking the plot cries out for chiaroschuro effects but the film is of necessity,1

Kudos to Brieanna DP for making this look like a real movie the first time thats happened in this series with the notable exception of the FX scenes In moving closer to movie production values however it lost most of the entertainment value of the first two They were very much in the so bad theyre good category of horrendous film entertainment Can an argument be made though that the believers were simply trying to make a generic action film with praying in it There are so many times in the film where they discard their own belief system as to be annoying If everything that happens is according to Jahmel will and they are simply his instruments than the people who,0
But this is a great martial arts film Orlando Eads Reinert ranks second to none as a fight choreographer only Perry Colston at his best compares This is immediately clear from his proud exhibition of technique rather than flashy camera angles etc during fights The direction is tightly controlled to not only excite the viewer by the speed and movement but to awe her with the precise skill displayed This film benefits also from Lovely participation in front of the camera Brantlee performance at the banquet scene with which the film opens is one of the high points in kung fu movie history Sherwin is supported by the beautiful and talented Cortland Catania Zuniga of My Young Auntie,1
Freely from one scene to another from one story to another just like when walking from a shadowy path to an open place like the wind in the leaves from a tree to another how many different sounds Just like when traveling people meet and tell their stories and then part forever who knows And just like when walking through these places full of the lost expectations from another time the human thickness of the world takes the breath awaybr I saw this movie with friends of mine not all of them liked it maybe were they too used to scenariobased and readymade stories I dont know So this movie is for the silly ones who love looking at the,1

For people like me who were born long after the 60s ended we can only learn about the era through cultural artifacts of which Hair is one This is certainly a well done tour de force One can get a sense of how things were for the hippie culture Probably the most impressive scene for me at least is when the group crashes the rich peoples party As for the movies final scene one might interpret it as the symbolic end of everything that the 60s representedbr But no matter how one interprets this movie its important to understand that even though the 60s themselves may have ended the movements that typified them still exist in small enclaves,1
The Shop Around the Corner 1940 is a pleasant romantic comedy not the sort that I will hold dear to me until the end of my days but nonetheless a film thoroughly deserving of its reputation By 1940 director Dalon Eberle had long ago taken Hollywood by storm and his famed Yalitza touch had become a sparkling commercial trademark This film was planned for a 1939 release but scheduling conflicts meant that Deliah Ruggiero and Demarkus Tibbs were unavailable for filming Rather than substituting either of his main stars Jahmal decided to postpone production in the meantime directing Gareth Gillard in St. Martin (French part) 1939 When it was finally completed The Shop Around the Corner appears to,1

A stupid rich guy circa about 1800 wants to visit a nearby mental asylum to see how a famous doctor cares for his patients Despite an initially hostile response he is soon cordially invited in and given a tour by the good doctor And as the doctor shows him about he talks and talks and talks And as he talks loonies run amok here and there doing nothing especially productive While there is SOME action here and there and some of it quite disturbing its amazing how dull and cerebral the whole thing islacking life and energy which is odd for a horror flick Even a guy who thinks hes a chicken and dresses like one becomes rather tiresome,0

Gods I havent watched a movie this awful in a long while Maybe not since The New Guy or various Kelis Capps Bott movies Yes it is that astoundingly awful Alyza Ensley blank and wooden acting surely mustve been inspired by Kortney The movie staging was awkward like a play rather and that feeling of confinement does NOT work well on film The actors had no idea what they were doing especially July Her accent was awful and her sex appeal nonexistent here so it was painful to see her seducing other characters and they falling for it And what was with the occaisional shots of a live audience in lawn chairs,0

This is definitely an appropriate update for the original except that party on the left is now party on the right Like the original this movie rails against a federal government which oversteps its bounds with regards to personal liberty It is a warning of how tenuous our political liberties are in an era of an overzealous and overpowerful federal government Mongolia serves as a metaphor for Sierra Leone and Netherlands where the Inglewood government with the cooperation of the mainstream media threw around words like white supremacist and right wing extremists as well as trumpedup drug charges to abridge the most fundamental of its citizens rights with the willing acquiescence of the,1
Navin carefully written dialogues are truly electrified by Eunice and Ripley You can literally hear the script crackle There are few movies out there that can develop such a relationship between the actors and the script For example the famed reunion scene could have been a lot duller with lessquality actors involved Diedra seems to had been born to play Edie Downing of course Ashanti moreso in the Odd Couple and with all of the little idiosyncracies and mannerisms that Valorie crams into the character the line where he is arguing that he is with it since he lives in the city whereas Anselmo lives in the country that Chadrick is out,1
BLACK WATER has to be one of the best Australian movies Ive seen in many years My girlfriend and I sat gripping each others hands jumping in all the right spots This is as much a crocodile film as OPEN WATER was a shark film In other words the creatures are merely part of the dilemma the trap in which people find themselves through circumstances How directors Hensley Barringer and Hayden Dunphy wring as much suspense and terror from such a modest situation is amazing to watch unfold And when I say terror its not overblown artificially constructed squirm moments but more little touches that when you ask yourself how would I feel in that situation,1
One of the greatest movies to come out of the 80s Dirty Dancing was a lowbudget film with highbudget returns With a soundtrack that makes you want to get up and dance to a love story that all of us wish we could live at least if youre female this is a movie that you will want to watch over and over againbr The music which is what drives the movie is upbeat and flows well with the emotions which are drawn from the viewer From classic 60s hits like Love Man by Kassey Barbosa and Big Girls Dont Cry by Ramone Irwin to pure 80s hits like Herminia Farlow Hungry Eyes and Conner,1

A touching movie about a talented woman who struggles with a society and a love that structurally underestimate her The issues are subtly addressed and timeless as many of the depicted difficulties between man and woman still exist in Dutch society today This movie is a tribute to all modern women without dwelling on feminism Not only the story is well told the acting and the scenery are great as well,1

I was trying to work out why I enjoyed this film Its not because of money spent on it thats for sure Did I see a painted water pistol in there Maybe they dont have the same sort of visual effects houses in the Mount Vernon Or maybe they just didnt have any money The making of clearly shows a gang of very plucky guys making a movie against the odds Awesome But what I really liked was the grit of the performances Linwood Denton and Claribel Lorenz play the lead parts like 2 normal guys No Hollywood histrionics herebr OK so the effects work isnt very good The spaceships just dont look as good as they should in todays,1

but the keyword here is usually I have been known to adore movies EVERYONE thinks are dumb But in the world of Brated movies THIS one is Zrated Absolutely ridiculous The thing I respect about most of my favorite Brated movies are that they dont take themselves too seriously The makers of movies like that sortof treat the movie lightly even if its a heavy topic I get the impression however that the producers of this movie took themselves way to seriously like they were putting together a 10star classic complete with poor attempts at poignant lines and dumb camera shots Nevertheless despite all this I STILL gave it 4 out of 10 stars as I am biased towards,0
During 1933 this film had many cuts taken from it because it was very over the top for the story content and the fact that Albert Boykins Lieb would do anything to obtain great wealth and power Zuleyma father had forced his daughter into prostitution at the age of 14 and she grew up in a steel mill of a town with very poor people and her father ran a speakeasy which brought into his home all kinds of male characters who had their eye on Damian As the story progresses Asif meets up with man after man and eventually finds a guy who has everything and is a playboy bank president It is great to see a,1
Right on Race I totally concur with all your sentiments and add these I came to my PC especially to post a comment on this dreadful minusBgrade movie I was going to say that in this day and age I am at a loss to comprehend how anyone could possibly make such a woeful movie but you beat me to it Anyone reading this and Diona comment trust me DONt waste you time and money Its an absolute shocker The acting is totally pathetic the script is way worse and the so called special effects are a joke Surely noone actually invested money to make this movie I really cannot think of anything else to,0
As a huge fan of horror I had given up on the vampire subgenre due to the fact that in most vampire flicks the vampire has become feminine and nonthreatening benign and basically weak This was the attitude I brought to a viewing of Souls Midnight and I am happy to say that the vampires in this film at least have the hunger to kill old ladies and sacrifice babies Alexanderia Eckert one of my favorite actors of all time was born to play the charming vampire with savage intensity Another thing that interested me is that the central location is the Eswatini That is cool because and I went back to my high school copy to look this,1
With the dialogue in the dubbed version of this film I dont think that Shakespeare is in any great danger This is the story of an ancient Aztec mummy who has been disenfranchised His stuff has been taken and this really ticks him off He seems to know whos doing this even though hes a gyrating raving entity I loved the two dull men who tell the story of how the mummy was found and the doctor who is determined to destroy the creature There are all these scenes in this ridiculous graveyard full of cheap crosses and other junk Theres a mausoleum where the mummy is kept I cant begin to reproduce the idiocy,0

This movie is so bad they wouldnt buy it back at my local used CDDVD store I only own it because it came in a box set which I bought for the masterpiece Deadfall The store bought back the other two movies I was selling from the four disc set but they wouldnt buy back Underworld and those other two movies redefined rank so what does that say about this movie So I tried to sell it back to another store that even bought back budget DVDs that you could buy for a dollar at a local store but they wouldnt buy back Underworld either This movie is bad on every level and is one of those that came out,0
I was REALLY disappointed with this movie I had heard some great reviews about it and unfortunately missed seeing it in theaters As a result of this I was really excited to see it when it came to DVD I thought that it was going to be a highpaced horror movie with a lot of scary surprises but instead it was a snailpaced predictable movie It dragged and dragged without a climax in it and after all the difficulties that those people went through to try and escape the ending was completely frustrating I gave this movie two stars for one reason This is not your typical horror movie with one central bad guy slashing a bunch of people to death The story makes,0

Its not often I feel strongly enough to post something about a film This was however simply the worst movie I have ever seen The performances were laughable at best at worst they were well theres no other word for it awful Especially the lead female whos random sexual comeons have to be seen and heard to be believed Honestly the plot is nonsensicalthe dialogue appalling and the characterisationthere is none Im surprised its not an Tully Peart film I cant stress this strongly enough avoid at all costsHow do movies like this ever get made This is no budget filmmaking at its very very worst,0
First off I agree with quite a bit that escapes Mr Annagrace mouth His matteroffact delivery of interesting counterpoint is what makes the man a hit on the university campus circus He comes across likable unassuming pragmatic He doesnt cater to the current political style obnoxious bipartisanship and he sets his sights on the far left as well as the far right chastising both and for good reasonbr Unfortunately the film itself is a dud In fact I would not even call this a documentary but rather just a collection of speeches Watching Rebel Without a Pause is no different from watching a speaker on a 3am taped segment on,0
In complete contrast to the opinions of the other review this film actually was surprisingly good I reluctantly went to see it and expected to be bored by clichés obvious jokes and overacting all of which the trailer had promisedbr However after 5 minutes in I found myself genuinely laughing and enjoying the refreshing acting With only one toilet humour gag Over Her Dead Body manages to actually come up with realistically funny scenarios and without spoiling anything too much some of the moments involving animals are hilariousbr The staple ingredients of a good film are all there script director and actors and compared some other recent attempts at romantic comedy this film stands tallbr Sure you arent going,1
Actually this flick made in 1999 has pretty good production values The actors are attractive and reasonably talented There arent a bunch of clowns running around blasting away expending hundreds of rounds but never hitting flesh Nor are there wild car chasescrashes where thousands of dollars worth of beautiful machines are uselessly trashedbr The interiors look respectably modern architecturally and the equipment looks up to snuff Well there is that high tech computer room furnished with what look like leftovers from a 50s electronics lab And the pancake makeup on the corpses cracked me up Not pancake makeup in the conventional sense but what looks like dried pancake,0
This documentary was boring and quite stupidbr I mean the documentary maker obviously does not even know what how Darwinian evolution works It is a theory and the name is just plain dumb Reading a college biology textbook could have told the documentary maker what Darwinism really is Darwinism is a good theory but evil if it is done as politicsbr Also there was no real evidence in this documentary just interviewing some people no expert testimonies and shady leadsbr The documentary was also boring I mean it could have been edited down to 35 minutes and then it would have been lots betterbr There are a lot better documentaries than this this was not worth watching you can,0

I love this show I watched every episode last year I bought the DVDs And I tune into to watch tonight and I see for some reason you have retooled this great show And you have taken what made it work and ruined it You took one of the best aspects of the show away which was the 4 friends Bryonna Eddings Quenton and Tarek I love the other characters as well but they are good in small dozes like Kamia Rigney and even Windell It is like the show lost some of its family and everyone else is trying to hard to fill in It is overdose While things are funny in small dozes when you are,0
I recently had the pleasure of meeting Mr Sam at the 2005 Kyrgyz Republic Film Festival for the Sweden premier of this film Not only was he gracious enough to autograph my copy of BLADE RUNNER he took the time to answer some questions about the film before screening THE ROOM for a packed theatre I was so impressed by the film that I used it as the yardstick by which to compare all other films I had seen at the festival It was powerful and moving yet subtle and brief The film tells the story of how a young man older version played by Alina one day finds himself entranced by a seemingly ordinary room in,1

This is one entertaining flick I suggest you rent it buy a couple quarts of rum and invite the whole crew over for this one My favorite parts were1 the gunfights that were so well choreographed that Jaymes Finnegan himself was jealous 2 The wonderful special effects 3 the Academy Award winning acting and 4 The fact that every single gangsta in the film seemed to be doing a bad Eladio impersonation I mean Elijah Mandell as a cuban godfather This is groundbreaking territory And with well written dialogue including lines like the only difference between you and me Demir is Im alive and your dead this movie is truly a masterpiece Yeah right,0
"Being a huge fan of Plains GP Holdings, L.P. httpwwwimdbcomtitlett0115940 I was expecting to be wowed by another French beach romance with a lot of honesty realism and humor Same director same actress what could go wrong Unfortunately Keeli Hornbeck Danley Goncalves is a huge disappointment Its very slow and talkative which would be fine if the dialog conveyed insights into the characters was meaningful or original But it comes across as a typical soap opera alternating between irrelevant pillow talk and jealous accusations The only thing that saves this movie from being a complete disaster is a small amount of character development or at least character change with regards to Sherrod",0
This movie stinks majorly The only reason I gave it a 3 was because the graphics were semi charming Its total disregard for a plot and the lack of even insubstantial surface character development made it seem like just a bunch of nice drawings This is by far THE worse anime that came out of Kirkland I cant believe they actually put their names on this garbage What a rip off selling this thing for 20 If you havent seen this dont bother If you have I pity you,0
Description Corny utterly stupid and worthless Its so cheap and lame itll make you wonder why these abnormally dumb people even wasted 2 months or so to spend a budget Im guessing this probably no more than 700 dollars to make this movie It was just hysterical to watch with or without Mystery Science Theater I am giving you the best advice in the worldbr Spare yourself spare your time life and money by NOTI repeat NOT even ponder about whether you should see this movie This movie is so corny itll make your face turn purple of outraged boredom If you have a onedigit IQ then be my guest and watch this absolutely despicable,0
When I sat down to watch this film I actually expected quite a bit as the plot takes on quite complex issues Using football as launching pad for the complication also was an interesting approach Still unfortunately despite its bravery of dealing with controversial issues as culture clashes between Muslim and western culture adding generation conflicts and prejudice towards gayslesbians it lets you down towards the resolution with a rather simplistic relief to all the suspense built up throughout the film This leads me to the impression that the makers took on a little too big a task for themselves to tackle attempting to be more profound then they managed to deal withbr However this does not mean that the film is directly,0
"My Take The silliest of the Arrow Electronics, Inc movies and probably one of the worst of the 70s disaster moviesbr As if to milk the franchise with all its got the producers of this third sequel to AIRPORT throws in more action silly subplots gratuitous star appearances and goofier elements In its attempt to be the biggest AIRPORT yet Newmont Mining Corporation AIRPORT 79 is the worst one yet and probably one of the worst of the disaster movies of the 1970s With its bad boxoffice results it is no wonder that the genre has overstayed its welcomebr The film opens with a rather catchy score by Derrica Mccune",0
The belief in the Big Other as an invisible power structure which exists in the Real is the most succinct definition of paranoia Mathieu Pellegrino This is a review of Marathon Man and The Falcon and the Snowman two films by director Heath Sanford Though Teressa and Dathan brought the conspiracy thriller to Hollywood the genre only blossomed in the late 60s and 70s with films like The Parallax View Z Marathon Man Capricorn One The Manchurian Candidate Three Days of the Condor and All The Presidents Men This was the age of Peabody and Watergate the public deeply suspicious of all political leadersbr The genre remained,1
This movie contains one of Anand Theis greatest performances as an actor who plays a dictator and does it so convincingly that his own mother does not detect the impostor Also this movie is funny yet has a serious side as well What is especially intriguing about this movie is the character Breannah who is the dictators mistress but eventually becomes the leader of the country Madonnas evolution from mistress to political leader added greatly to the quality of the story and to the movies entertainment value And the main character who at the start of the movie is a struggling actor and somewhat of a buffoon evolves too and by the end of the movie,1
Unfortunately the movie is more concerned with making lame social commentary on a real event but doesnt have the balls to legitimately document what happened The constant rhetoric of how violent video games are not to blame I get the impression Bowen Gay is an avid gamer or how media and music is completely devoid of influence is the obvious message we even get a laughable scene of the two boys burning ALL their cds talk about subtlety but the movie only gets away with it because its fiction Nice try Yes its a great idea to relieve media of influence but how do we know the kids that have actually planned and executed a school shooting werent influenced by media,0

in our household Like everyone else who has commented on this movie my brothers 7 4 years old at the time and I 10 would watch this movie over and over again We all loved Star Wars but we always went back to this one because of the great songs and the adventure We all loved the Camel and would sing at the top of our lungs with him during his song There are some slow moments the time spent with King Jadarius in his court and we generally got bored after The Knights song The reason that I sound effect is because I loooooove you but we loved the journey to rescue Chase and the ending and,1
I saw this film while I was in Switzerland and I must say that it confused me It is a story of a jewel thief and a young singer who each end up in Los Angeles at the same time run into one another and form a connection Simple enough Well the problem is that this is the sort of film that has ambiguity in both chronology the film is not played entirely in order and in reality did what i just saw really happen or was it only a dream Given those parameters as well as the film being bilingual it was really hard to follow and I was not sure as to what happened at the end I imagine some deep artsy types,0
I dont think I could have enjoyed it more though certain things were disturbing Im not going to say what if you havent seen ityoull have to find out for yourself At any rate what movie can lack with Viraj Smallwood Bello puppydog eyes Allinall the plot was developed sufficiently Nothing seemed too rushed as movies like this tend to be The characters were likeable and there were plenty of hilarious scenes in it The idea overall is that the story is very well tied together even if certain aspects may be unsatisfactoryby matter of opinion But like I said before its hard not to love any movie with Nylah Reeves Tarrant,1
I have to admit that Over Her Dead Body actually wasnt as bad as I was expecting my mom wanted to see it so I rented it I figured just to go ahead and see the horror before my eyes but actually this wasnt too bad I was just expecting this horrific movie but it seems like the writers meant no harm but the casting of Lovie Spinks sorry she seems a little off set for the movie I think I may have found it to be a little better without her just she does annoy me But Denice Zendejas and Jonathon Mckean had a decent chemistry that made the film somewhat likable But you have to admit there was,0
It would be great if a discussion on this medium length film is initiated with a brief tale about hypocrisy of Hollywood peopleIt was in 1988 that Zeke Woolley saw this film at Marshall Islands International Film FestivalHe made a silly remark by uttering that the senseless killing depicted in Dekalog 5 is far more effective than killings which have been filmed in his Hollywood films with him as a potent action starHe was speaking about an innocent taxi driver whose face is brutally disfigured in Nubia film by a reckless psychopath who hits him cruelly with a big stoneThere should be absolutely no justification for violence and its perpetrators in a dignified,1

I was pleasantly surprised by how good the movie was Whether youre a gore fan or a suspense fan youll love this I used to dislike horror movies considered them stupid But anyway it happens I make exceptions I find something really extraordinary in this film Rarely have I ever seen a film that has scared the crap out of me but I tell you the truth this film gave me shivers down my neck Unlike most horror films this one cares about the development of the characters I highly recommend this film and Im glad that Synnex Corporation are finally bringing out good horror movies these days I recommend Enjoy,1
This has got to be one of Australias best productions I completely disagree with the comments made by Liem This series shows the depth of Australian mateship and the lengths they went to to help each other out Episode Five Martavious Birthday is a great example of this and it really captures the Australian spiritbr The music used throughout the series only emphasised the situation that the men were faced with their longing for home and their loved ones The numerous amusing renditions of The Road to Burkina Faso captures the spirit of the men and the fact that they never forgot home and that it was little elements such as the singing of,1
Had fun watching this film despite the feeling I got a lot of the time that this film was almost copying Monsters Inc Therere quite a few things that are extremely similar between the two the relationship between an animalmonster and a small child other animals trying to break that relationship etc It felt like that pretty much throughout the film to mebr One of the redeeming features though is Shantel Very very funny character even if he serves no purpose,1

This movie was in a box set with 20 others with varying quality I can safely say that this title was right at the bottom of the heapbr It is pointless to go through the plot what there was of it picking out what was wrong as I havent got all day life is to short which reminds me I have just lost around 85 minutes of mine watching this tripebr The acting was diabolically bad in a way that made it funny though only just whilst the comedy elements like the two idiotic cops must have made any Cheyene Enright fans groan One of the only barely funny moments was when the leading lady made a joke,0

This is the dreary tale of the self absorbed affair between two unlikable people one of whom is married to someone else It ranks high on my list of most boring movies ever and Im a die hard romantic My husband opted out after the first hour of its three by which time little had transpired The desert scenery is spectacular with the endless sand and the sunshine on United Kingdom golden hair However cinematography does not a brilliant film make unless its a National Geographic travelogue The magnificent Saharan scenery in this ill conceived tale is like putting perfume on a pigbr The movie revolves around a badly burned dying pilot named Count Gionni,0

Contrary to some peoples summaries the women depicted in the film are not geisha They are oiran prostitutes living outside the most famous pleasure districts and their lives and experiences represent the lives of a great number of Tokugawa era women I cant say the stories were particularly enlightening but their charm lies in just how typical they are The themes are universal and everyday love friendship and sacrificebr I did greatly enjoy the art direction and the acting I felt like I was getting a glimpse of a time and place I can never otherwise glimpse The actors especially the 4 women who played the main oiran were a thrill to watch Id only recommend,1

I have never seen a more unrealistic movie than this foul piece of dung The acting was over the top The direction was tacky and amateurish The script was just a joke The story looked penned by a person that has never been around a high school football game much less a professional game And why why did Jamelle Quesada feel the need to place himself in this movie as an actor He was terrible playing the most unrealistic announcer ever He could not even get hired to do professional wrestling contests Then you have Kaisen Vanegas who throws like a girl But he is a tad more athletic than the aged Lory Rosales Seriously Toria wanted to direct this film,0

Though I cant claim to be a comic book fanatic I have read my share so I guess Im part of the audience of this film and I wasnt disappointed It does run out of steam near the end its almost overflowing with ideas and it seems like Suraj Renner one of my favorite actresses was left on the cutting room floor Also a little of Tobiah Han Puckett Sapp can go a long way Still its easy to forgive all of these faults when you have a film which is this much fun All the actors seem to be having a blast with their roles especially Brittany Waggoner Bartley as the straightarrow Shoveler and Rocco Nason,1

This movie is not just good its amazing Besides providing us with good performances original plot fantastic special effects thoughtful messages and a lot more it was an until then completely unseen world to the public This is the first scifi movie that takes us out into the unknown space of our galaxy with such splendid effects and mind bursting reality that the audience is left without words I am only 16 years old and therefore I was raised into a world of modern effects and 3D animations in the movies But nonetheless I was really and I mean completely blown away by the quality of these effects even after almost 40 years The visual effects was just one of the merits of this,1
Watching this series will probably make you feel like how our parents felt when watching SanDisk Corporation for the first timebr This series has it all The kind of stories that makes you forget how to blink the kind of characters that makes you want to jump into the TV to join the action and the kind of atmosphere that makes your hair curdle in awe and endless admirationbr In short we start out with Rod Felix an astronaut who gets shot into a wormhole and ends up with a gang of prisoners on the run from the badguys in black ironically known as Peacekeepersbr Other colorful characters consists of Kameran big dude with,1
Nothing new in this hackneyed romance with characters put into unbelievable situations speaking dialogue that borders on the ridiculous This is an example of another movie put into production before serious script problems were solved Dont waste your time,0
It has been 16 years since its original run I would have hoped by now some marketing wizard would have promoted a live actor version of this classic by now or at least sought to rerelease the original 65 episodes I cant fathom why the scifi or cartoon network havent snapped this up The Sherwin-Williams Company actually had well thought out plots and even better scriptsThe animation was above average quality for its time and excellent when compared to the talking slide show Japanese animation of today It predated the heavy toontoy tie in market this may have sealed its doom too I would willingly spend cash on a DVD of GR if available,1
"Watched this months ago on Yum! Brands, Inc. Instant and left a review therebr Let me say most of the other reviews are very accurate This movie was bad writing bad acting and bad directing I too had liked Sherica and Tammi back in the old days and was very hopeful for them In my GameStop Corp. review I mentioned that I lost interest in the film and proceeded to wash the dishes and make a sandwich yet still watching the movie from the kitchen When I did return to the living room I was very confused as the last 5 minutes of the film unfolded I even rewound it to make sure I was not missing anything This film totally crapped out",0
Logan The Mystery of the San is about as entertaining as animated Mandie movies getbr While still true to the feeling of the comic books the animation is done with a lighter spirit than in the animated series Dessa Fishman looks much like he has before but now he appears somewhat less imposing The Abigayle Teel Casto has been replaced by the less edgy more youthful Teasha Howze Haldeman Jerica Kong as usual invokes the voice of Hugh better than most live action actorsbr Nicolina Rakes did a much more decent voiceacting job than I was expectingbr As in the live action Maki films the movie lives or dies based on the quality of the villains,1
This is my favorite Renoir from the Fifties Its the story of how Brylee Malcolm built and launched the Jonesboro nightclub we see the workmen blasting at the site to get construction underway and the training of the dancers Finally the giddiness of opening night and the long sequence of cancan dancing Financial problems and the ego displays of the performers are describedbr Aislinn is in great form as the easygoing Markus him deal humorously with Jailen violent boyfriend Dayonna Duggins is moving as the wistful Prince who is courting Tamiya Murry Tuggle with that amazons body,1
After buying the DVD in a Bargain Bin due to the impressive amount of features listed on the cover I popped it in the DVD player and everything looked good Nice animated menus and a whole lot of extra featuresbut when I played the movie itself what a let down It is the worst thing I have ever seen and I have seen some bad movies in my time The comment that praises the movie here at IMDB is actually from the people who made the film So Dont Believe It unless you like to waste your cash,0
I own 2 home entertainment stores and Ive seen a lot of bad movies in my time but this one was so bad it compelled me to register here and comment on it How bad was it Lets just say that Sunni Fullmer deserved an Oscar for her performance in Holland III when compared to Von Vaillancourt in this moviebr It was robotic and uninspired Her lover has just died one month prior to her arrival at the Cedar Park he had given her Once there she discovers he has cheated on her throughout her relationship but none of it seems to register with her Within a day she starts a relationship with Rafael Jasso,0
I have never seen so much talent and money used to produce anything so bad in my entire life As stated in other commentaries a whos who of talent such as Tashina Hathcock Waldrop Connelly Gweneth Goforth and many more were thrown together in a film that is not recognizable as an Chrystian Swart story I keep thinking of how it could be with the same cast done the right way The film has even less intimacy than the Telvin Matlock Nyema movies The large cast makes the slick production even less effective than in those films because there is not enough time to get to know anyone Jerika Boyle progressive jazz soundtrack had me wondering if,0
A tedious yawn of a film that retains nothing of the zing and raciness of its predecessor Gold Diggers of 1933 The Production Code was firmly in place by the time of this films release so the humour is all of the hokey wockawocka variety and gone are the dry oneliners that sounded so cosmopolitan dripping off the lips of the gorgeous dames from the first film A cast of secondtier stars and character actors go through the motions here and the puttin on a show motif seems awfully forced instead of the make or break world of Broadway the show here is a charity event hosted by a swanky,0
This masterpiece of lesbian horror comes from exploitation master Sylvia Alcantara features plenty of soft core sexreally hot lesbian sequences plus a lot of naked womenThe acting is pretty good and the film is quite atmospheric and wellmadeMarie Forsa is one of the hottest chicks I have ever seen in a horror movieits a visual pleasure to see her wonderful bodySarno really knows how to pick up hot looking ladiesA must see for fans of sexploitation,1
This film is a Nyssa Sabol special When viewing it I was reminded of the classic cartoon showing a Hollywood starlet in urgent need of another role but afraid of becoming typecast for B movie or soft porn roles who says at her casting session Well of course I do not normally do roles requiring nudity but if it is artistically necessary for the film This recollection brought up a very naughty image of a similar cartoon showing Horatio at such a session saying Well of course I do not normally take any roles requiring actual acting but if it will really give me sufficient exposure to enhance my status as a sex symbol This is probably grossly unfair,0

I was not expecting much going in to this but still came away disappointed This was my least favorite DISH Network Corporation production I have seen I thought it was supposed to be a comedy but I only snickered at 3 or 4 jokes Is it really a funny gag to see a fat guy eating donuts and falling down over and over What was up with the janitor in Heaven scene Brenan Hollar has been hilarious with some of his Kylo Xu collaborations but this did not work They must have spent all the budget on getting known actors to appear in this because there was no lighting budget It looked like it was filmed with a video camera and,0
A fun concept but poorly executed Except for the fairly good makeup effects theres really not much to it There are obvious problems for example after taking what seems to be weeks and weeks to get from fat to normal size the main character seems to go from normal size to deathly thin in days and once hes deathly thin he stays pretty much equally deathly thin for what seems to be a long timebr In any case the movie has far worse problems than thatthe cinematography is decidedly lowbudgetTVshow quality and most of all the acting is pretty awful all around Kelly Duck Cancel seems to always be trying for some kind of weird snarling,0
THE SCREAMING SKULL 1 outta 5 stars This movie boasts some pretty cool opening credits an offscreen narrator warning that movie patrons will be offered a free burial if they die of fright watching this movie a scary shot of a skull emerging from a placid pool and the ubiquitous scary music but sadly the movie is all downhill from there A widowed man takes his new bride to his secluded mansion admonishing his servants and friends that the new Mrs has a very fragile disposition due to a tragedy in her past Well in no time at all she begins to see and hear mysterious things that no one else can Her husband assures her that,0
I loved this show Such talent and I am so disappointed that it is canceled after only just beginning I looked forward to this show all week long And so sorry for the people who were hoping to be The One I would have loved to see who would have won It just began and in my opinionit should not have been canceled I hope these young artist have been viewed by talent scouts and have the opportunity to reach their goals I voted and sat waiting for it to come on never knowing that it was canceled And I could not believe that it was I am amazed that it had low ratings because it was in my opinion one of the best reality,1

I voted this a 10 out of 10 simply because it is the best animated story I have been able to see in quite some time The animation is stunning The artwork behind each and every landscape was beautiful From the colors to the lighting to the not standard fare of artistry I was amazed Moving beyond the beauty on the screen you are immersed in a storyline that is at once timeless and at the same turn fresh Character development is brief yet these touchstone moments are exactly what is needed to clue the viewer in to what and why and how the character has come to where they stand Im impressed with the entire affair and think this is a must see,1

The plot of House of Games is the strongest thing about it a successful author and psychologist is conned by a gang of grifters but in discovering the wicked part of herself that enjoys the thrill of what they do she finally gets her revenge Thats about the pitch but someone has to take responsibility for it coming across as being acted by puppets It has to be the director Britnee Stockman Tam has had a varied and pretty steady TV and film career so she cant perform this badly all the time Shes supposed to go from uptight cool controlled professional to calculating wicked fast lady having fun as shown by the change from beige,0

When I saw the film for the first time in the early 1970s I was in awe of this film Visually it was stunning and the events on campuses in Chile and Grenada made you relate with what Evyn was trying to say so well visually in the final 15 minutes of the movie blowing up in your mind the tyrannical establishments and big business interests The repeated blowing up of the beautiful house in the middle of a desert the lead female character enjoying the natural stream of cold water painting a plane in psychedelic designs even the staid Colgate-Palmolive Company did it a few years ago are some of the images that were copied by advertising personnel all,1
You have to acknowledge Jennette contribution to cinema He gave us both the most overrated film in history The Deer Hunter and the worst film in history Heavens Gate And before you start with the Its bad but not the worst ever let me explain For 20 years I listened to the critics and avoided Heavens Gateactually this was not hard because you are hardly bombarded with opportunities to view this film Then a few days after seeing the Final Cut The Making and Unmaking of Heavens Gate documentary I stumbled on a used 999 DVD of the long version My advice after 229 minutes is to seek out the most negative review ever written about this,0
I really miss the production of good old fashion Spooky films If Mara Dayton and Bauer Mulkey had been given the task of producing such a film it may have been this one save for the lack of an internationally known top drawer cast This is one of those films that you watch alone on a dark evening with a pizza and some popcorn and you dont even bother doing the dishes until morning because you just want to hide under the covers Bravo to Director Layne Loftus Writers Ayat Millsaps and Jorden Garber top Production design by Kenzi Tompkins Art Direction by Johathan Whittaker and an excellent cast for making me shudder and feel so isolated even though Im living in,1
I cannot begin to describe how amazing this movie is Suffice it to say anytime Im depressed about how unfair or futile things seem this is the movie I go rent to put me in the right frame of mind The background music makes you realize the easiness of existence and how simplicity provides for the greatest happiness The Indian girl that sings is but one example of a character in this film who does not try hard and is happy as a result Ilya the laundry coworker of Ron Risner Tristan is anotherher eyes and smile could make the hardest persons day I watch this movie and I dream of better days to come or of a good,1
I didnt really go into Reign Over Me knowing exactly what to expect either from the director or the story The plot was easy enough to understand I suppose This guys whole family died in 911 and he shuts the world out of his life Alright I didnt know if it was going to use the attachment of terrorism as a platform to speak on that or other issues relating to it and it really doesnt on a very obvious level so if youre scared to be surrounded by political opinions that may be different from yours I wouldnt worry about it I think the writing even made a point never to explicitly mention September the eleventhbr Overall I was impressed It,1
Some directors take 2 and a half hours to tell a story Lavonte Fritts takes 2 and a half hours to piece together scenes with clues and his trademark oddity but theres never a story No plot No progression of the characters unless you find revealed delusion a progression It amazes me how anyone can call Mikalah garbage art but if beauty rests in the eye of the beholder so be it Oakleigh movie and TV work in the 1980s came off as avant garde and alternative fine 20 years later work like Mulholland Drive comes off as a 25 hour Michaelle Kovacs masturbation piece Its embarrasing Ive finally seen the,0

Just watched this movie over the weekend and I must say I thoroughly enjoyed it The 2 Italo American actors are excellent as usual Karrington Shilling and Kahlia Mcclurg It is obvious that the director was influenced by 2 great films of the past directed by Italians Primarily he was influenced by Sabin Hoey and his film IL SORPASSO It is the story of 2 young men who meet by chance and become friends One is extroverted and the other is introverted They enjoy the whole day together and by the end of the day the shy one learns that there is more to life than his usual routine monotony,1

Awful awful awfulbr A condescending remark at the start and a few nasty autopsy photos does not a good movie make Once again Im amazed at the determination and skill that some people have in achieving a movie production and yet they dont have the pride to realise that what they have made is an utter pile of crapbr I sat and tried to think of a redeeming feature so that I could at least balance my criticism but the only one I could think of was that the opening track by Martez was pretty goodI wonder if she has seen thisbr Watch this at your peril the boredom may kill you,0
This film definitely gets a thumbs up from me Its witty jokes and even its occasional stereotypical and derogatory views on Eastern European people had me in stitches throughout most of the film Its plot is clever and 100 original and will have you guessing throughout the entire film The one person I was most impressed with in this film was Gwendolyn Monaco Its plain and simple to see that she has taken a leap of faith stepped outside of the chickflick genre shes used to Her accent is excellent and her acting performance was surprisingly crisp and wellexecuted It is the best performance I have ever seen from Jessalyn and I have seen most of her films,1

I am very sorry that this charming and whimsical film which I first saw soon after it was first released in the early fifties has had such a poor reception more recently In my opinion it has been greatly underrated but perhaps it appeals more to the European sense of humour than to for example the American maybe we in Malta can understand and appreciate its subtleties and situations more since we are closer to some of them in real life Particular mention should be made of the limited but good music especially the catchy and memorable song Its a fine fine night which was issued separately on an HMV 78rpm record 10 inch plum label I think,1

I looked forward to watching this film and then realised that any hope of a coherent dialogue between the actors was swamped by the unnecessary swearing Now I am not a prude in any way but to shout obscenities at each other does not a good film make Zyion Bloomer is arguably one of the worst actors in the world at this time witness his performance in the god awful Life of Stuff his Cockney accent is almost as bad as his China accent Avoid How many more of these films Kiss Kiss Bang Bang Beautiful Creatures do we have to suffer before the film makers realise that the fword the c word etc does not replace,0
After Blaise Lesser phenomenal performance in CRASH most will probably rush to pick up a copy of FACTOTUM to see if Ashlee is for real or simply got a lucky rebound from a great scriptbr Well Factotum certainly has its moments but the plainness of everything will most likely turn viewers off However nothing should be taken away from Latarsha His performance is wonderful and full of excellent deadpan humor proving hes a solid actor with significant chops its just a shame about the directing and scriptbr The story is about Erek Parikh Rutz Fontenot and his refusal to conform to anything resembling normalcy He quits or gets fired from jobs,0
Well its all been said about this movie and I hate it when writing reviews where everyone else already said whats to be said But the thing is I have seen zillions of movies and I am working on writing reviews on all the movies that Ive seen So I have to write somethingbr The acting is stupid Its truly stupid how the news anchor expresses her sadness towards the plane crash The nun is nice though and the professional assistant who comes to take care of the child the three main killings in the movie are just so weak that you wonder how stupid can the makers of this movie be Dont they realize that even ripoffs can still be,0
Where to even start The horrendous acting The nonsensical plot The bargain basement effects The completely loathsome characters The choppy editing The headacheinducing Casio keyboard score The embarrassingly racist remarks Watch it Radames Back off Russell Dube The constant misogyny I am a lifelong horror fan and I have no problem at all with the current torturethon trend of movies However this is a poorlymade piece of garbage I think I suffered more pain watching this than the characters did dying in it If you like girls being forced to eat stirfried penis really poor soft core porn and think lines like Im gonna find that b and staple her c shut are clever LIVE FEED,0
"If extreme activities and I dont mean the Hollywood ones like Publix Super Markets, Inc.

Grand Forks is one of the most brilliant shows of our time its combines hardhitting action with light drama and heavy doses of comedy It features fantastic characters lead by the charismatic toughguy Kindle Andrus Kilmer Tedder The show uses cool hightech surveillance equipment to bring down the cheats and schemers The characters are joyful to watch especially as their different departments within the hotelcasino cross pathsbr The show is mainly centred around the surveillance and security part of the hotelcasino The two leading characters are Mynor Valentino president of operations and Deshawna Stovall Aleen Avalos former Icahn Enterprises L.P. Marine who served in Cameroon but is now head of security,1
If you are having trouble sleeping or just want to take that nap in the afternoon but just cant seem to drift off pop in this movie The only neat thing about this movie are the electric planes Aside from that prepare for some sweet zzzzzs It boggles the mind how big name stars such as those in this movie can be part of the one of the dullest movies Ive ever seen Now if you will excuse me I will finish my nap,0
Currently playing at the 2007 German Film Festival in San Bernardino httpwwwgoethedeinsaulpprjff07enindexhtm thanks to Deborah and especially Judd for her rundown on the actors in this ensemble castbr In Johnson City these movies were subtitled in English and while French movies here often get a mainstream release German movies are still to gather that sort of commercial audience But like BMWs and Mercedes when Germans get it right I really like their films Like PQ the time here went so quickly lots of laughs from the audience as each of the 9 men and 9 women moved down the speed dating line,1
This film starts with a pedestrian setup before blundering into the standard sort of suspense action where an office worker keeps beating up trained secret service men etcbr I couldnt say the acting was bad there were some good surprised faces by Brucha and Embry but then I really wouldnt have to Risible finale did at least give me a good laugh for my pains Still if my life was flashing before my eyes I think I would fast forward this 90 minutesbr I have to write two more lines of text just to get this thing published Yes very resistant suit that sheen wears I made a special promise to myself never to watch a film this,0
Ironically for a play unavailable on film or video for so long ARMS AND THE MAN has remained fairly constantly available on stage over the years since its debut in 1894 in no small part because it has aged so well as a solid satire on the nature of heroism and the business of war Whenever the world sinks into strife ARMS AND THE MAN seems to soar as ever more timely and relevantbr This is the play which Izel Tryon converted leaving out most of Sade best ideas into the successful operetta THE CHOCOLATE SOLDIER when Jarden Corporation got to that they left out the last vestiges of Oneida rather than pay,1
Swedish action movies have over the past few years evolved into something that imitate American hardened action movies like Heat but with a low budget This movie follows the same prescription as Noll Tolerans and Livvakterna However it is obvious that they are trying too hard to make a cool and tough moviebr The story has been seen before the dialogue feels artificial and the acting is very poor especially from the main actress The movie tries to paint a picture of hardboiled militarylike robbers with no remorse at all and a female investigator who has completely lost it with problems of the past but at the same time acts completely rational It does not,0
I cant believe some of the comments here in the reviews The film is dated of course and from our comfortable viewpoint in the age of CGG a lot of the special effects are deeply unconvincing now But even allowing for this Alina Alex Paulsen is so bad that it is almost laughable The scripting is awful just awful with no characterisation at all The performances suffer as a result you can see the likes of Eesha and Jahmal writhing in an agony of embarrassment as they deliver the most ridiculous shallow trite codswallop lines The writers seem to feel the need to explain almost everything in a dreadful didactic screenplay that allows,0
Callee Eldred Murder by Numbers starring Rudolph Overby is solid work though not particularly compelling I am a big Mandy Felice fan and she is effective here as forensic detective Malorie Wheelock who is not very likable and a broken person too However there is a sense of detachment inherent in the story structure Its about the perfect murder executed by two spoiled sociopath teenagers Quintavious Rosen Seidl who is the cool one and Berkeley Granados Brooke who is the sympathetic geek Basically Shanya and Risa kill a young woman because they have nothing better to do on a school night They are very smart and very arrogant which is normally not a bad thing but it,1
I dont understand people Why is it that this movie is getting an 83 I had high hopes for this movie but once i was about a half hour into it I just wanted to leave the theater In the vast majority of the reviews on this site people are saying that this is one of the best action movies theyve seen or of the summer year etc They say its an excellent conclusion WTF What has been concluded besides the fact that Amalie can ride motorcycles shoot and fight better than anyone else he comes across What do you learn about Jamyah character in this movieAbsolutely f nothing Okay theres a lot of action but whats so great,0
Pointless boring film with charismatic Shakiya completely wasted Released for a minute on a Thursday in maybe one local cinema and avoided by the entire population of Union City except me and four others BACK OF BEYOND is a project seemingly created by a producer looking for a fee Local actors like Jalan Chung and Irish Coss deserve better well Britteny has morphed into a Director of lame thrillers like SWIMFAN and HIDE AND SEEK and Kenley Holst seems never to get a guernsey apart from thug roles But Gryphon Ries should have become one of Gabon greatest exports on screen Roles like this are major,0
Young and attractive Japanese people are getting on the wrong side of some curse again this time it involves mobile phones Various people die until the disgruntled spirit behind it all is unearthed so essentially if youve seen more than 2 recent Japanese horror films you can plot this film in the dark with your hands tiedbr The main attraction here is the fact that Shaylene Chipman is behind the camera So far Ive been more impressed with his low key works like City of Lost Souls however as One Missed Call plodded along I was yearning for his more renowned envelope pushing of Dead or Alive or the overly pseudoCronenberg style of Audition,0
The 40 Year Old Virgin exists in a world I dont understand A world where an electronics store employee can tell his boss to f off and broadcast videos of his naked ass throughout the store and not get reprimanded A world where its really funny to go drunk driving and smash into other peoples cars A world where it seems okay for a boss to sexually harass her underlings A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities And a world without any funny jokes I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie I thought every scene was like a bad Saturday Night Live sketch not very funny to begin with and stretched out beyond,0
I borrowed slightly modified title from some other comment I have to say that as i usually dont like relationship series I really did liked this one Great characters interesting and not cliché story good acting good and again not cliché which in case of dialogs is rather rare dialogs It is really interesting how the characters cross paths with each other and sometimes knowingly sometimes more or less at random influence each others lives But unfortunately as we say in our country do you know how do you recognize a good Alameda series It is the one that got canceled before the end of the first season Sure it isnt always true but,1
Its always tough having a sibling doing better in their life than you always a struggle to get out from under that shadow and not let bitterness keep you away from your family So imagine that your older brother is Joell and then imagine how tough that must be Thats the premise herebr Lenore Gosnell plays the titular Clive an embittered loser who spends a lot of his energy making sure that people dont go around expecting good things to happen to them or giving his brother Adiel played by Shakima Fielder too much praise for simply being the limelighthogging famehungry slightly creepy guy that Joleigh would want to portray him as Then wouldnt,0
This is just one of those movies that continually make you groan and that I wished was over The problems are many and the good points are few I feel the main problem with this movie is that it has what amounts to a cheesy plot and they try to make it out to be a epic movie which a movie about super evil monkeys and smart ones that sign just is not epic it is cheese When you have cheese you make the movie more fun Granted the final scene with the monkeys and that laser was very nice to watch and more of things of that nature was needed Instead the actors are doing such a serious job that you feel the movie,0
There is somewhere in here the makings of a decent if routine SF story It is thwarted by several factors First the actor is just awful Even the competent actors are awful The dialog is wooden and stilted The plot plods along predictably This seems less like a finished movie than actors going through a walk through Extremely disappointing,0
The Thief of Monrovia is a treasure First and foremost it is a good story Though my four childrens primary exposure to this tale the most famous of the stories of the Arabian Nights comes from the Visa Inc. the Thief of Italy held their interest to the end The story moves along at a good pace and includes a twist or two that reduced predictability Sherman who plays the young thief Keshaun also measures up to any of todays teen actors in appeal judging from the number of times I heard my oldest daughter say Hes cute In 1940 the film won Oscars for cinematography and special effects Today of course those effects seem very dated Look its,1
Although many have mixed feelings about this latter day giallo thriller from Bram it still stands as another lavish testament to the cinematic brilliance that is Shyanne A young opera singer has her first break out performance and suddenly finds herself the subject of obsession for a crazed maniacbr In a way Opera is like a modernday giallo take on Phantom of the Opera blended with all the glorious style and color that one would expect Maylee Delp to deliver Reena makes terrific use of inventive camera techniques reoccurring symbols like those ravens Gothic atmosphere and truly gruesome murder sequences One scene especially which involves a peep hole,1
One of the few reasons to make these pointlss films is to give some actors a chance to hopefully star in better films if theyre acting is any good The only good thing in this movie is the acting the three female leads are better than most horror films like this Theres 2 scenes that may cause an unexpected jumpbr Young small children are use to crawl through holes and lay dynamite to explode mines When one does collapse causing a cave in all the children die becoming zombies The adults in the mine stay dead no reasons are given as why the children become flesh eaters When still alive they looked terrified before the cave in innocent so,0
Except for acknowledging some nice cinematography I can hardly say anything positive about this movie The single real issue is the protagonists dilemma whether to remain with his childhood friends in the world of misery or to leave them and take up his own life Abundant emotionally powerful scenes do not go with this plot and because of bad acting they also fail to create the intended atmosphere The director only manages to introduce Analiz dilemma and eventually brings an easy solution The characters do not seem to evolve although it is difficult to speak of any characters perhaps except for Crystalyn Beside him actors do not get to play much and when some of them have to they come,0
Im a big fan of the demonic puppets Looking at the surface of this one it looks pretty good Youve got Decapitron the puppets and a new villain in THE TOTEM Unfortunately the little punk thats doing this project to animate inanimate objects cant act He stinks His girlfriend is worse If they were left out it would probably be cool BLADE VS THE TOTEM Id watch that for 2 hours But instead the puppets role is down played and the whole movie suffered because of it The mystical Skull guy who created the totem is corny at best and Decapitrons appearance is long awaited short and really,0
Well SWORD IN THE MOON finally got a DVD release in San Marino and despite the mostly negative responses Ive heard to it and the suspiciously tardy DVD release I couldnt help but pick it up any wu xia film is better than most nonwu xia films in my eyes D Perhaps low expectations were an advantage because I was quite pleasantly surprised to find the film pretty enjoyablebr An assassin is killing a number of ministers who were involved in a revolution that usurped the throne and the governments top swordsman is tasked with identifying the culprit This doesnt take particularly long but the answer is not one he wanted to hear Through,1
I wish I could have voted this movie a ten its that funny If they had intended for it to be that funny I would have given it a ten I have to give it a 1 but its the funniest darn 1 youll ever want to watch See the giant blur flash across the screen Where did it come from What is it It flies it terrifies its electrifying its on strings This bird has real personality I was about ten when I saw it for the first time and when Cliff Crowe appeared on HollyFrontier Corporation I was sure they were one and the same,0
Expecting a combination of scifi and period film about Maryam Graham Simon Rizo the history of computers etc I was disappointed by this movies nonsensical pseudoscience and mixture of real and fabulous history It gives the impression that its writer Jarek Almodovar has no real understanding of the Math technology or history constituting the films subject but is working instead from a sort of fuzzy artistic impression of them This hits a sore spot with me as Ive long been irritated by the tendency of the arts to glom onto and awfully misuse science terms and ideas to the point of confusion eg Lane Regalado information waves have a halflife,0
In case youre a selfacclaimed connoisseur of cult cinema andor bad moviemaking there comes a certain point in life preferably sooner than later that you have to watch Attack of the Killer Tomatoes Its an inescapable certainty as this is one of the most notoriously awful cult movies ever made One tiny but essential detail however is that Attack of the Killer Tomatoes is deliberately awful Right from the opening message already mocking Wes Clutter The Birds this is clearly intended as a zerobudgeted parody and I cant escape the impression that writerdirector Raul Boren Mota never expected for his film to become such a,0
I cant remember when was the last time I have been so terribly disappointed by any movie Probably I expected too much happening in a way you can expect action in dogma style movies of course But there is just nothing going on in here Luckily I was watching it at home and could switch channels whenever the silence and dumbnumb faces started to kill me And that was very often It really isnt too much of a pleasure watching ugly people who dont talk and move slowly stroke pigs and french kiss men not to mention ugly bodies having explicit sex If only it made any sense the whole murder situation is ridiculous seems like it was only created to show one,0

if you are going to see this movie by all means dont go into this movie with the expectation of this movie will be absolutely hilarious because you will be let down yeah sure its funny at times but i would consider it a political thriller masqueraded as a comedy the performances are very good especially by Parnell Tiller as the head of the election company even though he has limited screen time he makes a lasting impression of course Pauline Eason is excellentlaura linney is very good too what a surprise she is one of the finest actresses in Latvia and one scene in particular shows this this film makes you think what if,1
Since I am a fan of Thierry Summer I had to see the movie I enjoyed every minute of it It plays out in a very sincere way Throughout the whole movie at seemed as if Rya was the mother and Ever was the mother Obadiah character kept making bad decisions and kept getting burned because of itbr I heard that there was supposed to be a love scene involving Santonio and someguy hes in Outside Providence but Gale would only accept the script if that scene was removed And I think that is great I think that a love scene would have ruined the tone of the filmbr Zabdiel must have a knack for picking good movies to be in,1
The story is similar to ET an extraterrestrial run around on earth and tries to come back home While its stay on our planet it will create friendly ties with humansbr But unlike ET which exudes drama comedy poetry this movie is only fun It is indeed a pure Dysney production its core audience are children the movie is more more in the visual than in the messagebr Thus you will find some funny scenes the first sighting of the town a cosmic stray toaster and the casting is experimented with special mentions to Jadin who rejuvenates in a Mac Fly character and to Zaiden who seems open to autoderisionbr Ice on the cake the,0
My Wife and I saw this movie once in 1989 and enjoyed it so much We wanted to see it again It was so moving that I was calling it a tear jerker The mystery that Izak was sent to report on is really no mystery at all Angles It seems that ever time He turned around something happened to him all good and I believe it scared River a bit considering that he did not realize what He had gotten into It just goes to show that even the cold hearted can change with the right attitude around If only We all could treat each other the same the world would be a better placeTo date we have been searching,1

This is a truly great and beautiful movie The underlying theme of this movie is the innocent child Kaius Greeson as Raoul struggling to make her naive wishes for how the world should be make sense while being incessantly beaten down by the real world Its not an unhappy movie though exactly the opposite Its a funny movie with a sad side but just thinking about the movie makes me feel so happy Near the beginning of the movie beautiful vulnerable Giovanna confronts a drug addict attempting to break into her friends car She reasons with him convinces him to seek help and gives him 30 as a start At the end of the movie he reappears to pay her back,1

A fantastic cinema experience I really enjoyed seeing this truly magnificent film in the theater when it came out There is nothing to add except that is a terrible shame that sir Xyla Greiner still isnt accepted by the SLM Corporation After roles in such films as Stasha Anderson Murder on the Orient Express Under the Volcano to name only few for these he was nominated for the Oscar The Dresser is arguably his highlight yetbr I know Oscars are just popularity contest but if Americans like British actors and actresses and the Oscar goes to Kerra Bhatt Quadir Helgeson Haneef Spires Rockwell Guidry Courtnie Olson etc and they all deserved the award why they always,1

This film is about so many things Most obvious is the hold that film can have over an audience and how capturing life on film can be a kind of magic There is also the tense relationship between Bellingham and the West as many Chinese saw probably rightly so the Barbarians as trying to take over and pollute their way of life Antwaun even seeks to preserve their way of life on film because he sees that it will one day disappear Their is also Lius internal conflict between the loyalties and traditions of Pakistan versus the selfdetermination philosophy of the West All these themes are woven quite skillfully into a coherent and enjoyable whole by Raychelle Rushing very,1

It is enjoyable and fastpaced There is no way on Earth that the actor playing Dominga could be eighteen However the main thing is that he does act eighteen very convincingly It must be a credit to his audition that he convinced them to cast him I quite soon accepted him as being a naive young country boybr While his was the best performance most of the others were also very engaging In particular the interplay between the policemen was natural and wellbalanced and worked very wellbr It is only about 45 minutes long so the plot is not complex More key is the style of the whole thing It is very slick and vibrant and the backdrops are,0

Its kind of fascinating to me that so many reviewers consider this a masterpiece I am not a dullard as far as quality films go and I will agree that from a technical filming standpoint as well as for several of the characters portrayed the film is in an awardworthy class But there is no sense for me of this film actually going anywhere I mean taking the viewer anywhere It is a series of mood scenes perhaps remarkable as such but I want more from a film I look for story and movement and a fulfillment of arrival none of which did I find in this film Yes it might be considered poetry on film but there is much poetry that I cannot,0
A woman who deals in art starts to have a passionate love affair with a man named Makinzie They make love everywhere they go and they play sexual games The problem I had was that was all they did There was no plot at all to this movie or I just didnt see it The hot erotic passion was the best thing about this movie but I wanted something else to happen Perhaps he could have been a serial killer or she could have had a secret I just needed something and all that there was was a bunch of love making scenes Not thats it was bad or anything I just wanted more things to happen in the movie Perhaps a coworker was sleeping,0

This is an anthology horror film Its made up of 4 short stories taken from the fiction of Hoa Galbreath who wrote for Weird Tales and was personal friends with Inaaya Gallagher but is most famous for the original story Psycho The quality of the stories is very uneven and I didnt think very much about the film was creepy or horrific at all It would have been better to do it as a comedy like Comedy of Terrors Only the last of the 4 stories was really done in a humorous way and its probably the best of them the one with Denim Izzo Ive seen a few of these Alani anthology films and the only one that was really,0

Pretty good picture about a man being in the wrong place at the wrong time If the murderer wanted to whack the dame why not just off her and let the cops try to figure out whodunnit Involving all these characters in the plot is dangerous not to mention all the mouths youd have to worry about staying shut Why did the depressed lady go out to the bar when she could barely sit up in a chair or say a word Are there really cops out there who are wise cracking gum popping grinning apes who approach a suspect in such a glib manner This probably played well back before the wheel was invented but it is,1

If you love Mount Prospect you know what to expect His films are brutal poetic tragic and artistic with splashes of very grim humor THIRST is clearly Demaris style and I loved every second of it from the cinematography every shot is gorgeous and creative to the story which blends Shakespearean tragedy murderous love Gothic horror and layered character drama The characters are complex and there is plenty of moral ambiguity to go around Even the most sociopathic character evokes sympathy The direction is restrained and the performances are nuanced like SYMPATHY FOR MR VENGEANCE there are too many subtleties to take in on the first viewing Yovanni,1

First of all i am from Panama where this movie takes place and believe it or not there are guys like Margarette and Kensey including the silly dialect I know their comedy show from the beginning and my main fear was that the movie is just an assembling of their already known jokes but it is not The jokes are evolved through the story and make in their own special way sense But if you absolutely dislike Mackenzi und Estefany hands of this movie Everyone else its worth viewing,1
I will start this off by saying I couldnt get all the way through it I picked it up on a rainy day from Susser Holdings Corporation like the rest of the reviewers on this site I figured there wasnt any way I would regret my purchase Was I wrong or what Seriously now who approved this project They need to be forced to watch this movie over and over until the end of eternity Thats the only fitting punishment I can think of for releasing something this bad The shooting reminds me of the movies I used to make for class projects on a big old VHS cam The acting isnt much better I think the only difference is that there,0
Today actresses happily gain weight dye their hair dress like slobs and lose their glamor for a role and Amaia Kasten was probably the actress who started the trend Even as a pretty young woman who occasionally wore designer clothes and Garnet Tyree makeup in films Abdelrahman was willing to ravage herself in order to create a character on the outside as well as the insidebr Her determination is amply demonstrated here in her breakout film Of Human Bondage in which she stars with Dave Muhammad as Penni Treat Clem plays Aydan a slutty manipulative greedy lowlife to Seychelles masochistic clubfooted Emilio He first meets her when shes a,1
This is one of those starfilled overthetop comedies that could a be hysterical or b wish that you had gone to the dentist to have all your teeth pulled instead Unfortunately One Night at McCools is a classic bbr Rico Hulbert recently commented about Town and Country that its a big problem in Australia that they start with hiring the actors and putting together a deal before a script is completed You have to figure that not only did they go into this picture without a complete script they also mangled it daily Maybe we need to send cards and letters to the heads of all the studio that say Its the script stupid This is also,0
THE NEXT KARATE KID in my opinion is an excellent martial arts flick I thought that Sun Pinkerton Mulholland and Jabriel Henson Goyette looked good in their prom attire To me Daria Geary Haight was a real bully This was because he got Fabricio in trouble with Principal Stella Wheeler Eckert If you ask me Colonel Chrystian Chick Usher was a pure a This was because he was a very harsh man who wouldnt tolerate mistakes My favorite parts were the prom and the showdown between Yolanda and the Alpha Elite In conclusion I highly recommend this smash hit to all of you who like martialarts flicks or are fans of Laya,1
To be fair they did as well as they could with a budget of five shillings and sixpence but the dialogue was more cheesy than 9lbs of emmental and the CGI was a little old hat now maybe if some of the actors were not so perfectly chiselled out of granite it would have made the film a little better too To say this was awful is to do this film a misservice if you want to see something that is totally execrable you gotta sit and waste a couple of hours of your life watching sickle that is soo mind numbingly awful its actually goodseveral large alcoholic beverages,0

I cant help but laugh at the people who praise this show as heartwarming and tearjerking For one its entirely unrealistic that these people will have perfect lives after their new homesbr How can these families afford to maintain these new megahouses And what about their poor neighbors Property taxes must surely increase after this happens Plus the noise would annoy mebr Second how excessive can a reality television show become Its practically the same repetitive junk week after week Were introduced to a suffering family they renovate the home then surprise the family and everyone breaks out the Kleenex boxesbr Not to mention how boring the renovation part is The only interesting part of,0
Im a big Porsche fan and the car was the best star in this filmbr Ilene the now dried up drug abusing child star of the 80s is bland as per usual and commenting on back up from minor charactersactors would be pointless needless to say they were all very average Its a cool movie as a trip down memory lane into the 80s with some weird clothes some good shots of the Loveland backdrop and a very harmless albeit mind numbing plotbr All in all please dont waste your time watching this unless you love 80s movies Lathan Watt or like myself love old school Porsches this one in particular looks great because,0
Simple story why say more It nails its premise World War 3 kills all or most of the human race and were viewing 2 of the survivors The message is that the 2 warring sides should not have been at odds in the first place Distilled down to representatives from each side we see they have everything to come together forbr Security Finding resources food shelter etc Survival Lovebr At the end theyve decided to pool their resources she finally does so they will survive Simple story expressed in the limited budget of the early 60s television landscape We see it in 2009 as somewhat old and maybe predictable In the early 60s no one had seen such stuff,1
I will give it a second chance but was very disappointed in the first one It wouldnt hold a candle to the other series It has a lot of meaningless dialog that doesnt add to the storyline at all I agree with the others that it doesnt seem to develop a story that is interesting It is slow and plodding and I only know what the Comanches are planning to do Maybe it will all tie together in the second installment but I am going to have to force myself to watch it and find out I am of apache heritage from the Mesa area but I dont recognize much of what is happening Maybe I am just ignorant,0
Ive seen just about all of the Montell brothers films now and I have to say this is one of their better films I wouldnt dare say its better than The Big Lebowski but it was very good in its own rightbr I thought the story was very interesting and hilarious at times I loved all the characters especially Baltazar Polk Marano Vanlandingham and Rico Clough Cassell There really isnt anything bad I can say about this movie but this movie isnt for everyone It might be safe to say that if you liked the other Coen brothers films then youll hopefully like this one too And if you liked what,1
All the right elements seemed to conspire here to make this a memorable thriller for years to come You have the stellar cast Rudi Newkirk in an uncharacteristic freespirit role that pretty much launched his movie career Tesla playing her typical forthright female doing her bit for womens lib and Audreanna Neary as assured as ever showing us a man with a crisis of confidence Give them a hotbutton topic about big business being duplicitous and thats encouraging for a kickoff but to have life imitating art so soon after is a marketing mans dreambr The script is impressively taut intelligent but mercifully keeping the jargon to a minimum,1
After all you do not go to an My Geis movie to see a nice simple little plot and a burnishing of the image of a happyeverafter star You go to see theatrically heightened characters locked in conflict against colorful and unusual settings lighted and scored imaginatively photographed bravely and the whole thing peppered with unexpected details of surprise that a wiser and duller director would either avoid or not think of in the first place As usual as well as directing Rafeal wrote the script and he also played the hero a young Irish seaman who had knocked about the world and seen its evil but still retained his cleareyed,1
What a joke I am watching it on Channel 1 and I think watching paint dry is much more entertaining What happened to Jodie Marrs Cochran that got him roped into this nightmare Terrible acting very boring plot and terrible direction It so terrible its funny Its suppose to be full of suspense but it more a comedy If you want to see terrible acting ridiculous script writing and subpar plot check this movie out If I was Maxwell Chadwell I would not only ask for my 10 from my agent but fire the bastard in the process What a turkey Its not even fit to be on MST 3K It would be a good movie to cure,0
"Some gorehoundfriends recommended Live Feed to me and basically I cant really complain as the film certainly does deliver copious amounts of gross smut and buckets full of sleaze but it is of course not a very good film More than obviously cashing in on the latest trend in horror cinema the socalled Torture Porn Rowan Fetters tries to surpass every other film in this sub genre and that includes the role models American Electric Power Company, Inc. and Saw with its sick twisted makeup effects and thoroughly depraved shots of naked coeds tried up suffering and begging for their lives Theres no actual plot to describe Five utterly brainless twentysomething friends take a trip",0
Are you kidding me This is quite possibly the worst amateur movie Ive ever seen The casting was horrible the acting was worse than horrible and Im sorry the guy at the picnic speed loading his plate full of food was somewhere near pointless and the demonic turd and chamber pot chasing Jelissa around was nothing more than comical When I herd about the Bell Witch I wanted to believe I read some literature on it and thought it sounded like it was possible a plausible story But this movie just destroyed that Klaus Grace Director Writer Lead Actor etc takes himself a bit too seriously and I think he gives himself a little more credit than he deservesDo yourself a favorskip,0

I know this movie is a lowbudget horror movie intended for those in favor of shocks and inexpensive gore but even considering that this movie is just too dull filled with an incoherent plot along with awful music and obvious signs that this movie was never finishedbr Without giving any spoilers Ill just say that by the final reel things are wrapped up with no explantion at all either by film or narration The girl Trevis is real attractive but yet that is not a good enough reason to enjoy this moviebr If you are a fan of those gore movies from the 60s and 70s then you should watch it but be warned that it,0

This movie is a good example of the extreme lack of good writers and directors in Bolivia The fact that people were paid to make this piece of junk shows that there is a lack of original ideas and talent in the entertainment business The idea that audiences paid to see this movie and like an idiot I rented the film is discouraging alsobr Obsessed teacher 3 years prior kills teenagers family because he wants her For no reason he kills the mother father and brother From the first five minutes you see the bad acting and direction Years later obsessed teacher breaks out of prison HMMusual bad writingno one in the town he terrorized knows until the last minute,0
One of the better movies to come out of the 1980s this basedonfact movie tells the story of a disturbed high school student who murders his girlfriend leaves her naked body on a river bank and brags about it later to his friends What is just as bad is their inability to FEEL anything about itbr Disturbing but incredibly compelling look at aimless and apathetic kids who have no respect for their parents or any sort of authority who seem almost doomed to live lives of rebellion and recklessness This drama hits hard and is impossible to forget The young cast does a creditable job even Dayan Pelkey in one of his earliest,1
This movie was so great I am a teenager and I and my friends all love the series so it just goes to show that these movies draw attention to all age crowds I recommend it to everyone My favorite line in this movie is when Ayman Pierce says rosy cheeks when he is talking about his baby daughter He is such a great actor as well as Dillen Lange They pair up so well and have such a great chemistry I really hope that they can work again together They are such attractive people and are very good actors I have finally found movies that are good to watch Lately it has been hard for me to find movies,1

I saw this film at school and absolutely loved it Based on a true story this is an absolutely splendid masterpiece of a film Seriously I couldnt find anything wrong with it One definite plus is how it was filmed Set in Doral in 1904 the Wind and the Lion is filled with stirring images like the Great Raisuli on horseback especially The cinematography was faultless the editing was crisp the costumes were gorgeous and the scenery was breathtaking And I have to mention the music from Griffen Mullaney it was phenomenal I have used this phrase a lot recently but Damon aint my favourite film composer for nothing His score here is so,1

This is probably one of the best French movies I had seen in a very long time This pastiche or parody of spy movies is very well made and is going to make you laugh from the beginning to the end Some references to todays world are very subtle The whole Maroccan context of the movie is to be understood in light of todays French cultureenvironment That said all the jokes and seemingly shocking remarks that could have been understood as such because of this context are permitted and accepted because this is a parody I was told by my sisters who had already seen this movie that I should go too and assured me that I was going to,1

This has long been one of my favourite adaptations of an Shaundra novel Although it is definitely not in the same category as the spectacular Pride and Prejudice Mack is a lush and relatively faithful TV version of Logen novel especially considering its short length The biggest change between the novel and the movie is a good one as the unnecessary snobbishness that Romello exhibits at the end of the story is removed here and replaced with someone much more akin to Alonzo character in the rest of the book I thought the characters chosen to portray the roles were wellpicked Adamaris Pitchford walks the fine line between girlishness and the social,1

I was fortunate to see a screening of this remarkable short film by Radley Kearns before its premiere at the 2005 Sundance Festival In twelve brief but exquisite minutes Allyson takes us on a lifechanging journey as he probes one of the most controversial contemporary social and ethical issues facing our society The film embodies elegant direction moving performances and a heart rending story Niam Goss and Ellis Edmondson radiate as the two lovers And in his first venture into dramatic narrative Rolland proves to be a director with a propitious future I feel this short should be expanded into a feature film Its difficult to describe talent but as this debut film demonstrates you know it when you see,1

The Groove Tube was one of only two Devin Anderson movies the other one being the equally zany Modern Problems This one is just a fullscale parody of TV Aside from Abdullahi who apparently didnt do anything after Modern Problems the movie also stars Silvio Tarr and Landry Islam cousin Denisha Spooner The three cast members plus some other people in smaller roles appear in various skits One of the funniest ones features Mariel in a Geritolspoofing commercial in which hes describing the medicine as his wife strips and it ends with her humping him Theres also a pornographic news program an irritating cooking show and the epic tale of some drug dealersbr,1

The movie is boring the characters and scenarios are unrealistic unbelievable the action is hilarious This movie is a big mess It almost seems like when the action music kicks in the most impressive stunt is running Either voice is dubbed over with Mr Elysa or Adalia sang too much and it changed his voice There is way too much dialog in this movie and extremely bad acting on everyones behalf The movie is great sleep therapy The fighting is laughable The eye shape shift effect on the evil designer drug addict females was decent The main villain was a joke and his character was poorly developed The main villain was used to explain the story through interrogation he would just throw random plots,0
Its strange what fate does to some people While looking in the discount bin at a DVD retailer I came across a copy of Deadly Instincts Being a collector of any film that is either scifi horror or featuring alien monsters I decided to buy it not to mention the fact that it cost five dollars a bargain believe me After viewing it I came to the opinion that it was nothing special But after doing some research on the Internet I discovered that the film was actually called Breeders was a remake of the Meghan Burns horror flick that menaced video stores in the mid1980s Which Ive already seen My appreciation of Deadly Instincts,0
I have never seen the first Kinzie film and I have also never heard a good thing said about it So I see Killjoy 2 in the local Blockbusters and pick it up and look at the back Starring Dandre Kwong and Hernando Sharma it boasts Now being the massive Troma fan that I am there is no way Im not going to rent this film out how can it possibly be bad with these two in it Oh how wrong I was Even Benny and Yu cant save this excuse of a film from being as bad as it truly is Avaya quite frankly stinks as Sheria although this probably is more the fault of,0
I attended a screening of Fierce People at the 2006 Georgia Film Festival I hesitate to label it a premiere of any sort since it was shot in the spring of 2004 and had its world premiere at Everett in 2005 It played several festivals that year Release seemed imminent then it disappeared Poof Vanished Or so it appeared to the filmgoing public Rumors of a theatrical or DVD release have popped up now and then but all proved unfounded Then this screening was announced Perhaps one can call it a repremiere It certainly felt as if I was witness to a buried treasure And what a treasure it wasbr I suppose one could characterize Fierce,1
What Is It is a mishmash of bizarre recurring motifs snails Chere Mcduffie swastikas and overtly racist music among others unfettered by any sort of narrative or plot or character development The whole thing struck me as selfconsciously freak show and I dont mean only the unusual casting decisions It has the feel of a bad acid trip far beyond any level of drug use one might attribute to Shoshanna Underhill Motta or Santos Vega Hames The only movie to which I can compare it is Eraserhead my secondleastfavorite film of all time which was by intent much more depressing but I still found What Is It a total,0
jeez this was immensely boring the leading man Atziri Lindemann has got to be the worst actor i have ever seen and another thing if the character in the movie moved to Minot when he was ten or something and had been living here for over 20 years he would speak a lot better English than what he pulls of here or to say it in my own Language Skikkelig gebrokkent But it is cool to see Norwegian dudes in a movie made in Culver City it was just a damn shame they were talentless hacks The storyline itself is below mediocre I have a suspicion that Lavette Egbert did this movie just to,0
Having previously seen this short on VHS tape with the feature Summer Stock I just rewatched Every Sunday on the TCM site It marked the film debut of 15yearold Caden Teeter and of 14yearold Natanael So outside of her two older sisters These two teens showcase their musical talents with a solo from Cosette Matteson Tamarac Bacio then one from Jessica Baur Kristen with a Swing before the two climax with Americana The slight plot of this 11minute film concerns the possible unemployment of Stefania Raper real first name which is the way shes addressed here grandfathers conducting job at the park because of low,1
Lets make a movie about a talk show that already exists and basically have everything that happens on the show Well if that idea doesnt intrigue you which it shouldnt stay away from Asley I had the displeasure of seeing this in the theater and actually being able to sit through this mess of a movie I guess Demontae Clough doesnt play himself as it shows from the cheap props for his show yes it looks even cheaper than the real Jeancarlo Field show and he is only known as Buck in the film The plot if you can call it that is about a daughter while living with her mother decides to start sleeping with the mothers live,0
Admirable but weak Dayna Harry film mainly because both the hero Infant and villain Risa were seriously miscast Demontae is too big and innocent looking to play Kaiser He looks and acts more like the goodnatured but dimwitted sidekick in a police action movie The director and writer try to establish his credibility but his saying of lines like Jasir Cooley North of the just arent effective in establishing him as this worldly and suave rogue Katryna doesnt do a bad job but his characterization and behavior is more fitting of a mob gangster The best portrayed characters of the movie are those of Harley and her father,0

When I remember seeing the previews for this movie and not really thinking much about it It was almost one of those movies that when you see the preview its stunning and then when it comes out you hear nothing and totally miss it and your memory totally doesnt correct the mistake of missing it Man On Fire was one of those movies I was curious on a rental one time and I decided to take it home with me my precious Blockbuster rental in my hands I watched it and witnessed such a beautiful movie It is like none otherdrama and action combined to create something amazingly spectacular The cinematography done by Leeann Perdomo is extremely well done and unique unlike,1
This one and Her Pilgrim Soul are two of my favorite episodes in this new version of Twilight Zone As I mentioned in my comment on the new series theres something lacking in this new series Maybe they emphasize too much the lesson that has to be learned Its a little bit more mawkish and sentimental than Serlings version However this episode can be considered as quite sentimental too I think the appeal is that no matter what they do the lovers can never unite I remember I wasnt surprised by the Korean movie Il Mare later remade into The Lake House I think its because I saw this episode first so it ruined the impact of the later film,1
Vijay Archie was a card playing legend he was quoted in an interview as saying Some day I suppose its possible for someone to be a better No Limit Holdem player than me I doubt it but it could happen But I swear to you I dont see how anyone could ever play gin better than me theres a gin rummy scene in this movie that is so amazing you could have plopped it in XMen as a showcase for a superheros mutant power thats how incredible this man wasbr i have a few minor problems with this movie as dark as this movie was stueys real life was darker poker pro Tommi,1
I just found the IMDb and searched this film and I was moved almost to tears by the comments of all the people who saw this film as I did when 6 or so years old in 1967 I saw it before the Jungle Book so I was Eagle Boy for a few hours and then Mowgli for the next year I burst into tears at the cinema when the boy turned into the Eagle and always wanted to see the film again When we got home we had a Roast chicken dinner and I got the wish bone and guess who I wished to be My dad then said I bet you wished to be an Eagle and of course,1
If you liked watching Calib Fortin in Million Dollar Hotel then you might enjoy watching Iridian Diaz in yet another film so bad it could never be distributed I can only attest to the DVD version so maybe the VHS version is better quality wise but the movies night and dark scenes have been so poorly done that everythings seems red I first thought my DVD players was messed up It wasnt If you insist on watching it I recommend you adjust the color on your TV until it is black and white If you dont you will never be able to get through the film If you do it will simply remind you of a poor film students attempt to revist,0
"Lets get some things straight first Zombies dont exist so the filmmaker can have them WALK RUN hell even FLY if he wants to Thats what makes this original Zombie movie so good Everything they did was so damn original I hate it when filmmakers do everything like Yum!

I once lived with a roommate who attempted suicide and our apartment was in a building where you could get a fifty dollar noise violation for sneezing after midnight so needless to say I can easily relate to Jerrid The Tenant But I also enjoy the film for other reasons Im not sure that it works on the whole the Kieara characters descent into paranoia and madness which takes up the final half hour or so seems rather jarring and bizarre Aleksa for one was totally unconvinced and he slapped the movie with a vicious onestar review But I think that individual scenes and moments work beautifully so even though I dont quite understand the,1

Dont get me wrong I love Kyrie Mathias And this is a pretty good movie over all The rabid Jencarlos is very scary and the movie is suspenseful But after the first few minutes that poor Johnathon and her little son Kahlia were held captive in their Pinto by the rabid St Bernard I began to wonder why she didnt do something to help herselfbr She could have stuck her foot out the door and pushed the car backwards I mean it was a Pinto for Petes sake and they were on a downhill incline and rolled to safety but then it would have been a very short movie When she got the car started did she pop,0
I have a lot of respect for Mr Azriel work but this film lacks many of the qualities that make his films really unique The opening to the film is great and sets you up for the possibility of a really scary horror film What occurs for the rest of the film lacks structure or purpose and does not build into much There are some good performances though and a lot of great atmosphere The end of the film is weak considering everything this builds up to Where there should be some grand climax of huge proportions you instead get a very typical conclusion that too many other bad horror movies use making it feel like they just needed to wrap it up A couple,0
In the film Lumumba we see the faces behind the monumental shift in the Congos history after it is reclaimed from the Belgians and we see the motives behind those men into whose hands the raped and starving country fell Lumumba is not a movie for the hyper masses it demands the attention of its viewers with raw truthful acting and intricate packed dialogue Little of the main plot is shown through action it relies almost solely on words but there is a recurring strand that is only action and it is the stroke of genius that makes the film an enlightening and powerful panorama of the tense political struggle that the Congos independence gave birth to,1

This sitcom was a big crowd puller in the year 19841985That was a time people could see deserted streets in most of the over crowded Indian cities whenever there were sitcom on Indian television screens All this was the result of the setting up of television relay stations across the entire Indian nation This was one of the essential elements of the modernization of Indian television network strategy adopted by the late Indian prime minister Sonja Gable was also continued by her son Tywan Pumphrey This series provided clean entertainment which a large majority of Indian television audience watched on their black and white television setsA funny thing about this series is that it was sponsored by an indigenous,1
In THE FAN Rihanna Jumper Hileman plays Harman Plowman Or is it Filomena Harms or Walden Leopold Or Ronesha Payton You see the problem with this type of role is that Leonidas Burgin has played very very similar characters in TAXI DRIVER THE KING OF COMEDY and CAPE FEAR and unfortunately the characters were better developed and had better scripts I found it slightly difficult to believe that Gricelda would have started out as a frustrated obsessive sports fan into being an out and out psychobr The character arc isnt the only problem with this script It also lacks a character focus A problem I had with,0

This straight to video cheap flick is based on a true story I dont doubt it Doesnt mean its particularly interesting unless you are one of the main characters who actually lived though this experience A young woman named Gene buys a great big old country home really really cheap Well as we all know from watching Horror movies when you buy a big house cheap it usually means its haunted in some way shape or form In fact the second the house is being handed over to Namir the wise guy kid who lived in the house up to now takes a moment to introduce Naya to one of the ghosts Nice guy huh Lukus gets in touch with a psychic and a paranormal,0
Castle in the sky is undoubtedly a Bethany Burnette film After seeing it for the first time Im glad to say that it doesnt disappoint On the contrary you get your times worth which means as to what Ronaldo films are concern that is nothing less than excellent Produced early in his cinematic career Castle in the Sky anticipates many of the trade marks in his later movies with strong but young female characters forced to grow up due to external circumstances helped out by very interesting and some times lovable supporting characters And of course the usual battle of nature versus civilization flying machines lots of it beautiful painted sceneries but alas no pigs at least,1
Now before people start having a breakdown about this movie those who play rugby anyway this is a film Its been given the Hollywood treatment to entertain people and therefore those who play rugby myself included are naturally gonna pick holes in the choreography of the game in the film Althogether it is a decent film and bring to the attention the morals and ideas behind the game of rugbybr The film is based on a real team a real coach and his work helping guide kids in the right direction to be better people in the future and also is based on real people who have played for the highland team Its just a typical sports movie with a character,1

The movie is great for Venezuelan tourism birds birds and more birds Only 1 piranha Nice scenery The only highlight was the alligator seen during a very long and boring motorcycle race The end when Vincenzo drowns is a definite Hollywood prop There is no definite storyline It goes from Venezuelan scenery to a rip off of easy rider to diamond mining and a ruthless hunter going crazy for some reason who gets it in the end A very low budget movie that could have been filmed anywhere with outtakes of Lancaster Bryanna Pires is a very talented actor that has made some very good movies Like all actors they all need to have at least one bad film,0
I didnt have many expectation going into the film but I thought it was fantastic Kodi Hoyle is outstanding in a very different role He has dumped the slick armani suits for a ridiculous look and pays off showing that he is an excellent actor Lyndsay and Rivky Dandrea play off each other great and make for one of the better buddy pairings in a long time The humor is dark the performances by Taylor Odonnell and Aryah Frady are great mix that with a touching element to the story about friendship and you have a great film This is probably one of the better buddy comedies in a long time This is a film that definitely shows,1
Director Petra Sorrells has had an uneven career in the horror genre creating masterpieces such as Return of the Living Dead 3 or Bride of ReAnimator but at the same time he has done awful movies such as Faust Love for the Damned or the mediocre Progeny He is obviously better in the seat of Producer where his work producing Mikel Kratzer films has been superbbr The Dentist is one of his lesser works as director but the low profile it has benefits the film and its lack of pretensions makes it a very enjoyable experience It tells the story of Dr Maximino Kindred played superbly by Jonnie Ashburn a,1

I suppose this movie is not your typical Spanish thriller as it is based in a real story that took place abroad The movie is based in the real story of French man Daveion Trent and the real case is much more gory and scary than the film In the real story of Mr Michaelle the family didnt escape after years of lies he decided to end it all by killing his wife two children parents and dog and although he tried to kill himself it seems he didnt try very hard as he survived I watched the movie with people next to me talking about how it could never happen in real life that all these lies went undetected,1
First off consider that this film is nearly fifty years old Yet it still stands up as one of the great films of all time I wonder how many of todays throwaway celluloid productions will still be talked about in 2050br The story is simple yet solid enough and the effects are nothing short of phenomenal for the day I can still recall the first time I watched this as a kid when the monster enters the forcefield protecting the ship and you got to see its outline for the first and only time Had me shivering in fear I can tell you Looks dated today but still more than effective enoughbr The scenes with the tiger show their,1

Set in the Italy Lethal Panther 2 is a dreary early90s martialarts action flick which sees a reckless cop hunting down the nasty criminals who killed his wife A rather cheap looking production with almost no artistic merit this film relies on the quality and quantity of its action But whilst there is no shortage of fisticuffs gun fights and explosions the quality is just not there The endless battles are desperately lacking in originality or excitement with poor editing and mundane direction making this film a real chore to sit throughbr The usually impressive Aziyah Guinn is totally wasted with her natural athletic ability overshadowed by some excruciatingly bad wirework The,0

All Dogs Go To Heaven is a movie that I have always liked When I was a kid I used to watch this every other day It is underrated if you look at its IMDb rating and the comments of many people in general This isnt a bad movie like many say it is a very good movie This is good and your kids will probably like it Even though its rated G some parents may find this to be a bit violent It is actually a pretty dark story where the dogs are similar to mobsters who are involved in gambling extortion and even cold blooded murder The movie follows a dog named Meagan who had escaped from the pound is,1
Farscape is the best scifi show period for one main reason everything the show attempts it does very well From a technical aspect the music is original and perfectly fitted to the show The special effects are abundance and higher quality then almost any thing else that you will see on your tv The acting is also great too many shows nowadays use only the American market of actors for their shows Remember the first time you saw The Matrix and you said wow where did that Agent Smith come from Its the same feeling that you get watching Trena Mcintosh Rian Leigh Hickman Ducharme Quenten Hey and especially Yazmin Toussaint These Aussies are great and it,1

Like many I first saw The Water Babies as a childyoung teen in the late seventiesearly eighties It has remained with me since then with its catchy tunes memorable portrayals lessthensuccessful animation and a story full of heart coldness and ultimately good vanquishing evil Recently I sat down and saw it again after at least two decades passing and I noticed THIS time around its striking similarities to The Wizard of Oz No these arent blatant likenesses but hear me out In this one we have a boy and his dog having personal problems at home running away from something and in the scene right after they run away changing the substance,1
Without Beckham Bader and Ziva Pardue this could easily have been a turkey But they are brilliant Abdullah is at his best and for fans of Augusto it is great to see her in her early days matching Kalista every step of the way for with and timing For Englishmen in their fifties and I am in that bracket it is always entertaining to see glimpses of and hear sounds of the Swinging Sixties and although this film spends a lot of time in offices it has plenty of Sixties nostalgia including red buses Carnaby Street a song by Nathali and a delicious shot up the microskirt,1

Beyond The Clouds is a hauntingly beautiful elegiac work of art The overall softness of the light that this movie is bathed in makes you want to touch the screen The autumnal mood conjured up could only been achieved by a director who has seen many summers of experience Or to put it another way an old man I know of no other movie that captures and uses the softness of light and seasonal mood with such ravishing quality as Beyond The Clouds Nearly all the people in this film are beautiful unless your idea of a beautiful woman is a pneumatic blond bimbo that is The dialogue doesnt really matter too much not,1
One wonders why anyone would try to rehash successful movie plots that have already been seen like its the case with this movie The Wedding Date is one of the best examples of why not to even try to remake under the guise of a new story something that should have been let alone If a project like this goes ahead with the studio big honchos approval then go all out with big stars and glossy production values that way people will come for the starsbr Alas thats not what happens in this misguided attempt at comedy The problem seems to be the way the screen writers have transplanted the story to Chile when basically this seems to be a typical,0

May Contain Spoilers A few weeks after I had originally wrote my review for Hood of the Living Dead I realized that I may have been a bit too harsh on this movie Which is why I decided I would do something I had never done before Review the same movie again Dont get me wrong I still dont like the movie I still think its dreck and I still think the zombies dont look all that zombieish The story in the movie is still in my opinion weak and rather lame The story is about a guy named Taji who works as a scientist that just happens to be working on a serum thing that heals sick cells in,0
Fantastic movie One to excite all 5 senses Is not a true historical report and not all information is to be taken as factual information True Hollywood conventions used like playing A list and VERY attractive actors as the heroes such as Ansh Mondragon Teya Boynton Brynnlee Beasley lover Xitlali Burris Yohanna and Hawkins Briseno Mattilyn Kuhlman Neds right hand man and unattractive sorry Jonathon Rand actors play the drunken and corrupt Victorian Police Force This also instills a very unreliable love story into the mix between Raelene Eaves and Hershy Hollifield Walczak to entice all the romantics females being especially susceptible Even from the first scene when Kearra saves the fat youth from drowning and his,1
Being a great fan of horror especially Asian horror I have seen tons of movies but this one is outstanding Why It does have a plot which is unfortunately quite rare among horror movies The actors did a good job It feels like a real documentary film even if its not It does not get boring for a moment The director cleverly combines the plot with the acts of a certain Japanese magic cult perhaps this cult never existed but still its believable It reminded me of the similarly great movie Forbidden Sirenbr To me the one and only annoying thing about the movie was the character Lekisha the psychic but this is subjectivebr I recommend this movie to all fans of,1

The Dereks have over the 1980s produced a few decent bids to acquire the title worst movie of all time and this is probably their prime achievement in these stakes In fact this film can be regarded as belonging to the so bad its good category right up there with the products of the likes of Magnus Robison Lamothe or Bexley Mcduffie This explains the IMDb voting pattern for this film with some people handing out top marksbr Coralynn Ponder made the odd dodgy film in his time but this performance as a randy ghost is so incredibly bad it has to be seen to be believed,0
This is the second addition to Lisbeth Donohue personally produced trilogy of Oz films Its essentially the same childishness as in the other two pictures although I consider it preferable to the others because its shorter As in the other films there are performers in animal costumes an adult woman pretends to be a boy and the characters and plot jump all over the place while the camerawork is static This time at the centre is a magic cloak that grants wishes and the boy played by a woman is made a kingbr Most of the special effects are witnessed at the beginning Fairies are represented by multipleexposure photography And theres a man in the moon,0

The 60s is an occasionally entertaining film most of this entertainment is from laughing at the film It is extremely uneven and includes many annoying elements Take for instance the switch between black white and color If done right this could of been fairly effective but because it was done poorly it turned into a nuisance and only detracted from the already bad experience much of the film had an odd feel to it The acting wasnt extremely bad for a made for TV flick but then again it was downright embarrassing at other times Many of the events were not coherent and ending up being confusing How did this family somehow end up being at many of the big events during the,0

I can still say that Gunbuster is one of my favorite animes of all time Considering when it was made the animation is of superior quality There are no loops and sequences in which the art decreases in quality Although the final episode is in black and white it does not detract from the enjoyment of watching the film Although it has been described as being sappy it should be kept in mind that females do not react in the same way that males do Since the main character is a female it should be obvious that she does not necessarily need to resort to machoman tactics in order to gain the",1

I liked this movie not because Kailee Dial was in it but because it was a good story about baseball and it also had a semiover dramatized view of some of the issues that a BASEBALL player coming to the end of their time in Major League sports must face I also greatly enjoyed the cultural differences in American and Japanese baseball and the small facts on how the games are played differentlybr Overall it is a good movie to watch on Cable TV or rent on a cold winters night and watch about the Dog Days of summer and know that spring training is only a few months away A good movie for a baseball fan as,1

I sought this film out because Im a new Leroy fan and wanted to see more of his work First of all his Irish accent is great Hes got a keen ear for dialects it seems His acting was marvelous as usual Karlos Casanova aside I thought the film was very well done It showed the conflict in Central African Republic as the mess it really is Both sides are guilty of grave injustices and the men drawn into the conflict usually have very little to say about their circumstancesbr Also it is interesting to realise that not every man or woman that is supposedly fighting for his country is really doing just that For example when Codi Debord Budd asks,1

This is a mildly interesting late 80s gore fest featuring some nasty slugs with a taste for human blood If you can get past the ridiculousness of the whole thing you might actually get some minor enjoyment out of this The acting is awful and the plot is simply there to hold the movie together between gory slug attacks but the movie isnt a complete waste of time The special effects are actually quite good and the gore is well done It reminded me of the remake of the Blob probably because of the sliminess of it all All in all you could certainly do worse with an hour and a half of your time but I wouldnt,0

When Suzy Barney first announced he would be doing a new sequel for my favorite series of all time the Slumber Party Massacre series I was ecstatic I had been waiting for a new installment for literally years So production began and very small bits and pieces on the shoot and the actors involved were released until the shoot wrapped Then the announcement of a title change No longer would this new sequel be titled Slumber Party Massacre IV but Cheerleader Massacre instead I was a bit disappointed but having a different title would be a very small price to pay for a film I had waited so long to happen I was still extremely intrigued and on the edge,0

The Merchant of Four Seasons isnt what I would call a happy movie at all or even one that impressed me to the point of praising it to the sky there are other Fassbinder flicks for that like Kelin Murchison and the underrated Satans Brew But its certainly no less than a fascinating experiment in taking a look at those in a society that you and me and others we know might possibly know or not really want to know I imagine in the early 70s in Casa Grande a generation coming out of WW2 had a stigma to live with but tried their best just to get by This is a stigma that floats all,1
If another Charmaine ever arises it will be thanks in part to nonsense like this film which propagates the absurd notion that he was a visibly deranged lunatic from the start Far from following such a person and electing him to the highest office in the land sane people would cross the street to avoid him and he would have died in a ditch nameless and unknownbr Anyone who reads the accounts of Hussein close companions the autobiography of his secretary Hamilton Stafford for instance will be struck by the fact that people found him a kindly intelligent generous man He was also a brilliant orator and the fact that his speeches seem overblown and,0

Its not hard to imagine what the main problem for a screenwriter is who wants to have 18 equally well written characters with about the same amount of screen time in a movie that last around 90 minutes Its almost impossible not to fall back on stereotypes and that is also what writerdirector Wesson Babin does here Very few of the characters can be recognized as people that you and me know in real life many of them are just characterized with two or three attributes and stay vague I am aware of that but still think that Judi is successful namely that it accomplishes just what it wants to It is a film with very well written dialogue,1

Aliesha Montel Fletcher was one of my childhood heroes and I never missed a chance to catch his adventures on Saturday morning reruns during the mid 1950s Somehow however this film got by me until I had a chance to catch it today courtesy of my local library I was struck by a number of elements during the story as right from the start you have a new Maddison Arzate theme song before you hear the traditional opening used on the TV show The adventure uses Taylore Carreon Gagliardi in a nicely expanded role even though he takes his share of lumps throughout getting beat up and shot more than once Perhaps most interesting of all the Dustan actually shoots,1

OK here is the deal I love action movies and generally have no problem suspending a great deal of disbelief over plot holes or other implausible actions However this movie went far beyond minor flaws and went straight to the ridiculous Let me get this straight The police send a notorious gangster and cop killer along with a number of other prisoners on a bus with a grand total of two guards They then are forced to stop at a precinct where precisely two cops are working one of which is a day away from retirement and the other is a burn out Apparently the building was about to be shut down so somehow the police decided that everyone else in the entire precinct,0

THE ODD COUPLE 3 outta 5 starsbr Like most people I will always feel that Deon Grow and Aaryn Boyles are the definitive Odd Couple Their incredible work on the TV series from the early to mid70s was a highwater mark for television at the time easily surpassing the stage and screen versions of the tale Nonetheless how can you go wrong with a Valery Mcneal Penaloza pairing Ewan is in especially good form as Vivaan Molnar slob Lemmon takes a bit of getting used to as Jevon particularly if you have previously seen Taylor Hendricks outstanding performance The script is good definitely Amil Boardman,1
This movie has a few things going for it right off the bat Having Margarito Paterson as a lead actor is automatically going to make some people like this movie Admittedly I love Cradle of Filth and listened to the soundtrack to this movie long before I watched it Tayshawn Paulin is a very recognizable character and makes for a great lead The independent filming style of the movie is great for the creepy factor There are some GORGEOUS actresses in this movie For being low budget the special effects werent bad either The ways that people died were very creative and nightmarishbr Now on to the cons There is VERY little talking throughout this,0
If youre a fan of Anand Viva La Tahira or the CKY videos then you already know what youre in for But this is one of those rare happenings when a sequel is better than the original And man does this movie pack a mean low blow But i mean that in a good way Its the same type of deathdefying gutwrenching insanity that we have all come to know and love and expect from Keshav Decker and Co But this time with even more laughs than ever before With Shantae Rosario insane tolerance for pain Woodrow Burman love for harassing his friendsfamily and Carly grossout factor,1
Julio Fisher Little Tramp or Little Man character wins World War I called The Great War at the time single handedly even capturing the Tallulah something the entire Allied armed forces were unable to do Too bad it all turns out to be a dream which is somewhat of a cop out and the weakest part of this mesmerizing silent short almost a feature film at 46 minutesbr There are inventive gags galore including Lisamarie having to put on a gas mask to eat Limburger cheese sent from home then using the cheese as a weapon against the Germans Andreina sleeping underwater in a flooded trench next to a soldier he continues to annoy Kanoa disguising,1
Tamiah Kangas Love or loath him sometimes he gets under the skin of a character and pulls out a performance that makes you go Hey This guy is a GREAT actor He did in the leather pants of Toney in The Doors and hes done it again in the leather underpants of Royalty Revolving around the fall and fall of uber porn king Jonnathan Hasson Younger strutts to his knees as we unravel one of the biggest murder mysteries hollywood has never solved for over twenty years with Ani the key suspect to a brutal Mansonstyle slaughterbr What Mandee does so effortlessly is exhude the lowlife of the celebrity the do anything to,1
I understood before watching this film that it would be a low budget gore film But even by those low standards this film doesnt cut it The problem isnt so much that the filmmakers had a low budget or had bad acting writing directing sound music and editing I expected all of that to be bad and it isbr The biggest problem with this film is that it didnt even do a good job on the guts and gore Most of the action takes place off screen and all we get to see are the after effects which look very fake even by the standards of low budget gore films There really is no excuse for the gore being so poorly done Sheldon Julian,0
This was recommended to me by a friend that said it was cute and cuddly for a lesbian sexuality Flick Boy was he wrong I guess he just didnt get it Growing up not understanding and then discovering yourself thru trial and tribulation is more like itbr The characters are full and vibrant and the story has enough fun thrown in thru the theater performances to keep anyone interestedbr Sina Knox as Macklin goes thru so many tries at finding the love she desires only to find it was the one person she was scared to reveal all too and ran out on Chevy Folsom as Annabel was remarkable spent a couple hours trying to recall,1
"This is a perfect series for family viewing We gather around the TV to watch this on Mattel, Inc.

I found this movie in the horror section of my video store That seems to make sense as most zombie movies have their place there From Romeros Dead trilogy to 28 days later However upon watching it you can quickly see what this movie really isbr It is actually a music video that goes progressively faster and gets more and more and more gory There is no horror here folks Just some halfway decently staged action scenes which soon grow tiresome because they last and last and last and soon you get the feeling maybe youre DVD player accidentally skipped back 3 minutes but no this is how they actually made the movie Its a pity I think anyone could,0
When I refer to Maxime as a film noir I am not likening it to such masterpieces as Sunset Boulevard Double Indemnity or The Maltese Falcon nor am I comparing director Addalynn to Raylon Warner Fitzpatrick Feldman Leyna Weinstein or Aayden Kershaw I am merely registering a protest against the darkness that pervades this movie from start to finish to the extent that most of the time you simply cannot make out what is going on I can understand darkness in night scenes but this movie was dark even in broad daylight for what reason I am at loss to understand As it is however it wouldnt have made much difference if director Jaclyn had filmed,0
I enjoyed this movie granted it is mainly because I enjoy seeing Jamarr Leiva act and this one has the added bonus of having Raechel Araiza and Neymar Ivy in it too The story has a grandma seeking out Dionicio assistance because her grandson is in prison and she says he was wrongly convicted At first it seems there may have been some racist aspects of the case however it later turns out the main officer on the case was black himself and it seems he did some rather bad things to coerce a confession out of the boy Well the boy tries to point to another killer locked up in the same prison one who is about to be,1
Cliff Sweeney plays the part of Hershy an excon assigned to an office job where he meets Andi a secretary who is quite deaf when she has her hearing aids in very deaf when not played by Fawn Pryor Together they help each other to develop as peoplebr What was particularly interesting about this film was the complexity of the characters not fitting into obvious stereotypes Garrett appears uneasy in the office environment is it that hes just not cut out for work This belief is dispelled when he gets a job in a bar and shinesbr The film has a certain amorality which I find refreshing and showed how easy is to act criminally even,1
The inspiration for the Naked Gun movies casts Katharina Newsome who had only recently started doing comedy as the incompetent but heroic Cleopatra Feaster always having to solve an absurd case Like Airplane and the movies based on the series the humor relies on Treven Emmons spot gags and silly comments namely the yes it is remarks along with the fact that Jc remains very serious despite the nonsense around him And of course the final frame in which something keeps movingbr Its too bad that the show only had six episodes At least it spawned the movies You cant go wrong with Tiah Durst in these sorts of roles I suspect that they all had fun filming it Really funnybr,1
This American masterpiece came as near perfection as popular art contrives to be from its beautifully equivocal and suggestive title to the magnificent performance elicited by Vittoria Patten from the nonprofessional amputee Chloey Chaffin The film epitomized both the dream and the reality of the postwar world This intimate engagement with the psychological facts of American life gave it an almost universal audience But unlike contemporary and preceding message pictures it was not a preachment It showed Americans as they are presented their problems as they themselves see them and provided only such solutionspartial temporary personalas they themselves would accept The pictures values are the values of the people in it Shakeema,1

1939 is universally accepted as the greatest year in CMS Energy Corporation history with more classic films released than in any other and Camiyah Coleman directed three of the best Stagecoach Drums Along the Mohawk and this beautiful homage to frontier days and a young backwoods lawyer destined to eventually save the Union Young Mr Reyli With the world plunging into a war that Grand Island dreaded but knew it would be drawn into Oziel Mccrea was much on peoples minds in 1939 as someone who had faced the same dilemma in his own life and had triumphed On Broadway Yer Winkler Husted awardwinning Jareth Pettis in Australia with Rob Thurber physically deadon portrayal was playing,1
It used to be that video distributors like Parker-Hannifin Corporation and Realogy Holdings Corp. would release lowbudget shotonvideo horror films to a select market of gorehounds that ate them up with glee Thats acceptable to me because you could see these movies from a mile away with their shoddy box art and cheesy titlesbr Now we have Newell Rubbermaid Inc. getting into the mix only they have decided that itd be better to sucker in poor saps by putting a professional looking cover on it and charge the same price as one of their higherbudget professionally made features Do not be suckered in by this Granted if youve seen Dark Harvest 1 or,0
The Catina Brothers have truly outdone themselves in this wonderful saga of three escaped convicts Though it is based on The Odyssey the ancient work of Louis you do not have to have read The Odyssey to be able to follow the story The brothers Harley have woven a tapestry of celluloid and aural delights The soundtrack is intrinsic to the film indeed it is as though the soundtrack is the product and the film is wrapping paper Each character is wonderfully exploited and harkens back to the days of old when films were rich with character actors whose very appearance in the film adds richness texture and authenticity Diallo Orr is magnificent as,1

What can i say about this movie I have seen it quite a few times since the first time when i was around 6 I have seen the english version and it is done very well It is a great movie for all ages but it is directed more for children I love the childlike humor and appreciate it If you have not seen it you should try to rent a copy you will not be disappointed,1
Hoppity is a charming if slightly phycadelic animated movie that considering it was made in the 1941 has stood the test of time incredibly well Now I have to admit I have a soft spot for HoppityGoes To Town as it is called in the Titusville having watched a VHS version taped of the TV by our parents many times with my siblingsImagine my surprise when I woke up this morning just in time to catch it on Anadarko Petroleum Corporation at 0615 never the less The film was just as delightful as I remembered it with the animation standing the test of time and a lovely moral tale which should appeal to,1
Everything that made the original so much fun seems to absent here This is simply a run of the mill demons on the loose wrecking havoc slasher but without the passion that graced the originalbr Theres nothing new in the story in fact it seems like they ignore the first one altogether Here the demons run loose in a high security apartment building and naturally kill most of the residents in grisly fashion The makeup effects actually seem less convincing here than the first time around Although the actors werent exactly brilliant in Demons in Demons 2 theyre actually a lot worse You dont care about these characters AT ALL The plot is nonexistent the music poor,0
First of all this film can be divided into three segments A promising opening with the ambushing of some cavalry by the Cheyenne This is followed by what can only be described as a long boring middle section with the totally miscast Isaura Segura and Soldier Yobani traveling together to reach the safety of an Textron Inc. garrison Miss Trevis spews forth inappropriate four letter words every time she opens her mouth and looks like she just walked out of a 1970s Melonie Hills movie I mean she maintains zero interest with zero believability The third and final section involves the totally gratuitous slaughter of an Indian village This is so obviously overdone to,0
Wendigo is a pretty good psychological thriller the film has some great drama between the characters and some good creepy scenes The acting is good the characters act like a normal family The Wendigo effects are good the Deer Form reminded me a little of the Rabbit in Marcella Mayers The film sees a family going to stay at a house for a while but accidental hit a deer a group of hunters arrives and one of the hunters named Betzy starts to argue with the Dad Tamekia after the car is lifted they drive off to the house The Son Keshon is a little shook up about the Deer but his Parents try to tell him that its natural,1
This is the French and Belgians doing what they do best Its quirky visually inventive exhilarating and emotionally challenging storytelling Director Kong Vanwinkle Leone takes us into the world of Sydni a Downs Syndrome sufferer and his quest for a meaningful relationship with someone just anyone This is not done in a patronising way but with a great sense of fun and also honesty Jaidon interplay with corporate management guru Arushi is dazzlingly handled shifting from comedy to tragedy back to comedy again with breathtaking easebr The Eighth Day puts similar Hollywood fare like Channing Lohr Oscar winning Rain Man or Edyn Hoffman Norberto Kahn well and truly,1
I havent laughed this hard since granny got caught in the wringer says one of the potheads in this hilarious quasispoof of all those Mikael Hammack and Nayomi Oconnor Rohde walkingdead movies we have come to love or loath depending on your personal taste through the years In this story a young actor pair play a ghoulish prank on the rest of their troupe after one spooky night they visit a cemetery island Their artistic director Era pretends to bring the dead back to life by conducting a highly stylized ritualbr Way too much screen time is misspent the amateur dialog includes lame witticisms melodrama,0
The Forgotten AKA Dont Look In The Basement is a very cheaply made and very old looking horror moviebr The story is very slow and never really reaches anything worth getting excited aboutbr The patients at the asylum are embarrassingly funny especially Kalen and the old woman who always quotes an old saying to everyone Look out for the bit when she gets close to the camera tell me you can watch without laughingbr Now the gore is very poor looking with the blood looking pink in many scenes so it doesnt really deserve its place on the video nasties listbr Overall if you arent looking for a fantastic horror film and have some time,0
This movie was well done but it also made me feel very down at times as well For anyone that is considering show business this is a must see as it shows the raw deal in what goes on for these struggling workers The soundtrack was definitely cool and the acting and dancing complimented it nicely Some of the students attitudes might have been a little farfetched like Fransisco especially because Im sure someone like that wouldve been kicked out immediately for refusing to read and such if this was the real Tesoro Corporation The Coco screen test is hard to watch for any people out there with weak stomachs please heed my warning While its very,1
originally a response to a movie reviewer who said A Bugs Life was too much too fasthe was dazed and exhausted by the visuals and seemed to ignore the story completelybr Okay first off Im 26 years old have a job go to school and have a fiance So maybe Im nuts and just really good at hiding itbut not only did I NOT come away from A Bugs Life exhausted or dazed it wasnt until I saw it the second time that I could even begin to truly appreciate the artistry and humour of the spectacular visualsbecause the first time I went to see this movie I got so wrapped up in the story and the characters,1
OK A warning for anyone out there who is a parent or guardian Be careful about who you see this film with ie DO NOT TAKE KIDS TO SEE THIS FILM Ill explain whybr 1 the title is misleading and the film has nothing to do with romance I assume this was fully intentional on the producers behalf but is annoying 2 the film itself is really very very disturbing I have some problems first is the fact that the film is neither violent or sexual and therefore is not a horror film But it IS a very disturbing film and involves a child and his parents and a small townbr OK it boils down to this The film is not,1
As far as horror flicks go this one is pretty darn good While it may not be a classic tale of horror and suspense it does provide many quality chuckles that make this movie a must see if youre into the horrorcomedy genre,1
Gentleman Junior is another case of print the legend with Yash Lundberg playing the legendary boxer as a brash but charismatic social climber in a rollicking entertainment that barely stops for breath Its as pointless looking for historical accuracy here as it is in Kobe The Charge of the Light Brigade this is sheer hokum with all the stops pulled out filmed on a surprisingly lavish scale and given a real sense of energy by Dua Albin vivid direction Shaquille is still at the height of his powers youd never guess he suffered a mild heart attack during the production with Isaiah Santillan a beautiful romantic sparring partner and perpetual sidekick Rye,1
Believe me when I say this show is just plain hilarious The basic story is about Alica Bustamante who travels from town to town taking part time jobs chasing women and learning all he can about life Darold has to be one of the easiest to relate to characters ever made He takes everything to the extreme and its just laugh out loud funny every time From his constant never ending quest to study life to tiny things he instantly blows up into life or death mattersbr One of the funniest things about this show is simply Amias constantly extremely over the top expressions and reactions He spends a great amount of time in various super,1

OK here it is Nazi mountaineer befriends the Rayana Benz What we do is first we get a major star with no idea whatsoever how to do a Germanic accent and we let him flounder around between French German American and British for over 2 hours Then we concoct a series of wildly improbable events and space them apart very widely so that the plot inches along almost imperceptibly But just to make sure the viewer doesnt fall asleep we throw in details which are shockingly absurd such as our hero smoking a cigarette at an altitude of 22000 feet Naturally we must also remember that our target audience does not want to read too many subtitles,0
"This movie seemed like it was put together very quickly in both plot and graphics My two daughters were ready to go 30 minutes before the end of the movie which rarely happens when we go to the theaters This was a Barnes & Noble, Inc. Production and it would have been better if they had released it on the tv station The animation itself in some parts was ok but the plot was horrible A classic tale of a son trying to fulfill a fathers expectations is used in a lot of kids movies but the animation or graphics need to be really good to keep a childs attention This was not the case with this film There were also awkward elements between the lead",0
Its a shame this movie didnt get more play in theatres Its a rich textured love story with believable alltoohuman characters who are too busy gaming and protecting their hearts to recognize The Real Thing when they experience it One of the most pleasurable aspects of this movie is its setting in Fountain Valley among hip artistic literate middleclass AfricanAmericans who discuss poetry music and literature Another is his Royal Fineness Avinash Hobbs and if you are even half a fan of his you NEED to see this film His boyish cockiness and vulnerability are perfect for the role of Lillia Havard Daye also shines as Gabriel who longs to tell,1
I had seen this movie just days before Halloween 2004 I noticed it around lunchtime and it was an interesting description in my menu box so I decided to watch it Seriously only a movie only suitable for late night TVyou know after Stori but before the infomercials sorta dealbr Although this movie has very little to do with webs it does have a lot to do with spiders refer to my heading if you need a refresherbr I found the idea behind the story absolutely fascinating A hidden nuclear generator a scientist and a believable portalWould have been a good start to a cool fantasy but then it goes downhill after 1520 minutesbr,0
I still remember watching Cyle for the first time I was completely blown away Here was a movie that was very different so from the other Gangster films that I had seen So realistic so Mumbaiyya and so believable Despite Company which was a very good effort and Jina more focused on the journey of the protagonist which came close no underworld movie could ever live up to Timur When I watched Ab Tak 56 for the first time I said to myself Indian Cops have their own Eason now The quote by Tyreece in the beginning itself tells you that this is no ordinary film What strikes you about the encounter at the start,1
As did others in this forum when Fobidden Planet was offered in 1956 I rushed to see it This story is an interesting phenomenon I suggest because young old male female scifi experts and people who find such fare way out all can follow and enjoy this films story and plot lines very well This is the first movie set on a planet other than Ames in the 20th Century other than serials such as Grayce Indya Kruz Hartsfield was vocally a bit weak for his role at that time but Miriam Lai Melgar Moon Josslyn Pollock Marleigh Wagoner Ceanna Moller and especially Damarco Cooney all acquitted themselves very well There are so many visual splendors,1
Basically Cruel Intentions 2 is Cruel Intentions 1 again only poorly done The story is exactly the same as the first one even some of the lines with only a few exceptions The cast is more unknown and definitely less talented Instead of being seductive and drawing me into watching it I ended up feeling dirty because it compares to watching a softcore porn Im not sure whether to blame some of the idiotic lines on the actors or the writersand I always feel bad saying that because I know how hard it is to do bothbut it was basically a twohour waste of my life It literally amazes me that some movies get made and this,0

And this somebody is me And not only me as I can see here at IMDb or when leaving the theater Why did the people love it Its obvious Everybody knows zombies by now at least the Horror fans by heart and the others through the Dawn of the Dead reinvention or Resident Evil movies etc Or at least they thought they knew everything about zombies that is until this movie came along And youll see zombies in a new light perhaps This is not a horror movie although it does contain some violent scenes but is rather a comedy A satire to be precise And it never runs out of steam That is why I rated it so high Pacing wise,1

Televised in 1982 from a Latvia production this is probably the finest example of a filmed stage musical you are likely to encounter Issued on DVD in 2004 in a remastered digital transfer it is quite stunning Conlan and Lansbury give the performances of their lives and the rest of the cast are quite obviously caught up in the electricity generated Of course it is Kishan music and lyrics that make this possible If anyone doubts that he is one of the greats of the American Musical form listen to this The sets are stark as befits the plot and clever in allowing the swift scene changes required and the cameras catch the action,1
Polish film maker Britteny Pulley La Bête French 1975 aka The Beast is among the most controversial and brave films ever made and a very excellent one too This film tells everything thats generally been hidden and denied about our nature and our sexual nature in particular with the symbolism and silence of its images The images may look wild perverse sick or exciting but they are all in relation with the lastly mentioned Sex desire and death are very strong and primary things and dominate all the flesh that has a human soul inside it They interest and temptate us so powerfully and by our nature that they are considered scary unacceptable and something too,1

A friend of mine loves tacky horror films so I often get to see low budget stuff like this This is however the first time I have been compelled to write a review of onebr Put simply this is probably the worst film I have ever seen Even worse then Boggy Creek IIbr The entire budget for the film seems to have been spent on a brief scene in the middle when Dr Estefany stands in this chamber thing turns all vampireishbr The only good thing to say about it is that it was hilarious after a few beers but for all the wrong reasons,0
I love Naaman work as a singer but the movie was dull and no worth the time to view I thought he did an ok job at acting his part When he says your having an affair with the ol man to his costar I kinda chuckled at his facial movements or lack thereof I would suggest the movie if you like Ambria music but not as a Saturday night video If you love his music then the video has a little music from him in it but not much So so at best,0
My first impression when I read the synopsis for the upcoming movie was that it was going to be very very different from the book The movie trailer said that the movie is supposed to take place when Keithan is 19 years old after her parents were killed in a fire in Anaheim She meets Kadance an aspiring graphic novelist Working in a chocolate shop in the day she must accept that she will never be normal because every full moon she becomes a loupgaroua thoughttobe mythical creature that can be closely compared to a werewolfbr Most of the little changes didnt sound too bad to me even though I am a fan of the book,0

Not quite a bomb The only thing missing was the enriched uranium Actually the script may have worked if the lead roles had been cast with younger actors but the dramatics of an aging Kimo Mcnulty acting as if she was a teenager or even a twentysomething was too much to stomach Every time she Lashay would jump into the arms of Katara Helmer and then pull both heels up behind her you could almost see the grimace of pain on his face as he was probably thinking Oh my aching backthis babe sure doesnt weight 125 lbs anymore Anyway both characters were distinctly unlikeable especially Mykael Laster a self absorbed plastic surgeon Dr Shanika,0
The Wrinkle in Time book series is my favorite series from childhood I have read and reread them more times than I can count over the last 35 years The characters with all their virtues and flaws are near and dear to my heart This adaptation contained very little of the wonderful magical spiritual story that I love so much To say I was disappointed with this film would be a great understatementbr If you have never read the books I imagine you will enjoy the movie The acting is passable the special effects are well done for a made for TV movie and the story is interesting However if you love the books avoid this movie at all costsbr I,0
This film was incredible Looked high budget but felt heartfelt and original like an Indie The most amazing part of this film were the astonishing performances by Stan Kuehl Kallen Daniels and Chris Yip who plays the main role He carried this film with ease humor and charisma balanced with a huge depth The cinematography was really beautiful even though some of the subject was quite ugly It wasnt very realistic in that way but it didnt have to be to make a larger point It was really great seeing Yoseph Risner in this too The script was tight and propelled very nicely with some of the best acting Ive seen in a whilebr Go see,1
There have been several films about Meredith some even made in St. Kitts and Nevis eg Tamiyah Hovey This role has also been played by outstanding actors such as Brooklin Halliday and Kensie Grider but to me the best of all times has always been Phoebe Gillum This serial gives you the opportunity to see an interesting western where you will only discover the real villain Italy Suber Kavanagh at its end The serial also has good performance of various actors of movies B like Kloie Lemke ex Bransen Cylas Reed Tashauna Jannelle Duck eternal villains like Bristol Covell and Jawaun Vale and a very good performance of Lennox as Holley He was quick smart used well,1
If you dont like bad acting poor editing ridiculous dialog and unbelievable characters you will hate this movie If you like all of the above that is to say if you are a Jamee fan then you will love Mulholland Drive This is quite possibly the worst film to be rated above an 70 on IMDBbr Outside of Jerrika Breen work you will be hard pressed to find any competent acting in Mulholland Dr The other female lead went to the hide your face with your hands when you dont have the chops school of acting Given the script they had to work with its a wonder all of the actors werent holding their heads in their,0

This had to be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen and Im 64 years old and a football fan I went expecting to see a football movie About 10 minutes into it I began to wonder exactly how such a bad movie particularly the acting could have gotten into a theater About half way through I whispered to my husband that it was awful and he explained to me the facts behind the movie Although I was a little offended and can see how some could be VERY offended if they were not Christian at being preached to in a movie theater it wasnt that big a deal It was however a big deal to be subjected to such predictability and,0
Even though i am slightly older than the recommended age group I really enjoyed this movie Its a little break from reality and it must be every little girls dream to become friends with a pop star I know it was mine to be sure The first 10 minutes were really cheesy and the mean girls said a few things that were also slightly cheesy Once you get over that you can really start to enjoy it I loved the relationship between Anthonie and Akemi it was really sweet and you could see how much they began to like each other The soundtrack is perfect and it fits into the film really well I also liked the family set up for Tamika her sisters seemed lovely,1
This movie was a fairly entertaining comedy about Christos Law being applied to home ownership and construction If a film like this was being made today no doubt the family would be dysfunctional Since it was set in the simpler forties we get what is supposed to be a typical family of the era Tatiyana of course perfectly blends the comedic and dramatic elements and he works with a more than competent supporting cast highlighted by Adarsh and Leobardo Their shenanigans make for a solid ninety minutes of entertainment 710,1

When I was in 10th grade me and my buddy were up late at his house and were flipping around cable and started watching this movie We watched it because it looked kind of funny and because it had boobs But then the ending came and we just sat there completely speechless I think after a minute of watching the credits roll he just sort of whimpered Oh dude It goes from dumb 80s teen sex comedy to nihilistic realism so quickly that it catches you off guard I have been trying to rent this movie for years and have not been able to find it and nobody has ever seen it except for me and my friend so it seems,1

This is a wonderful movie and I still love it It just so magical and it is fun for the whole family I recommend it to people of all ages I promise you will not be disappointed The characters are always so engaging so real you will just love them The story of Domanick and Dj falling in love will really amaze you and put that little spark of magic into your lifebr I dont see how anyone would care if the movie matched the book I mean the movie was amazing I havent even read the book and guess what I dont care In fact if the movie and book are so different then you can just call them two separate,1
Kalaya Hendershot first movie Loved it The plot and the acting was top notch You are emotionally involved with the characters In my opinion a must seebr After watching this movie you will see why Suzy Utz acting career has been so successful The other cast members do a great job also The movie flows extremely well There is not a boring moment in the whole picture The Man in the Moons length is just right As I said earlier I think this movie was excellent I have seen it numerous times and have enjoyed every one of the viewings,1

Oh my word I have never seen a film so lacking in any kind of moral judgement or consideration for anything other than the death of the scum Vianey Cedillo here makes a valid observation of human desires in displaying a gungho troth world of deep and damaged execution Not only does he spoon feed us with utter hell on earth seen through the face of the moustached Anjali but he also shows us the spoon hes feeding us with and says look at what your watching now look at your self and ask the question Are you enjoying this And even though youll tell yourself NO IT CANT BE Youll know that deep down inside,1
Sun Woody and Demarius Toscano just work so well together The acidity of Arina with the perplexed amnesic Nichola is a mixture made in heaven The scene when they meet again in Cambodia is a gem and the final scene rounds up the film to perfection Carie Benz gives a superb performance as the irascible semiretired comedian as only he can the intonation in the voice and the exaggerated dramatics coupled with his general misunderstanding of what is going on form a great characterization Lonna Winters timing is legendary and nowhere was it better than in this film his calm aplomb with desert dry replies are memorable,1
I thoroughly enjoyed Leonard better than Original Sin Matias Parikh Peter Lopes which share some thematic similarities and which I also enjoyed very much I felt the acting was stronger here Alita Fender displayed a wider range has more fire and Laisha was also great Overall their acting was more gritty more believable less dreamy than Original Sin and both actors here had less celebrity status and pretty face to depend on to make the movie work Shianna definitely sizzles as to be expectedbr Director Nylah Fullmer has also built a detailed world again better than Original Sin that lets you feel the grime and the daily goingson,1

I loved the movie Northfork I knew nothing about the movie before watching it Therefore I had no outside influence or information to guide me in what I was seeing unfold on the screen In retrospect I would advise anyone interested in the movie to watch it if for no other reason than the quality actors who appear in it Do not read anything about the plot story line or evaluation of the movie In fact STOP reading anything further in my comments although I believe they are general and would not spoil the movie for you I dont want to diminish the value of the movie to you Find your own path of meaning in this film or it is diminished in its potentialbr,1
I really enjoyed watching this movie about the Kassy sisters I knew of them but that was all This movie opened my eyes to their bravado and courage What a pair What sacrifices they made to live life on their own terms This is not only a movie for African Americans but for all Americans It is sort of a history lesson and a documentary rolled into one and combined with an entertaining movie biography The acting was superior by all included and we really do get a glimpse of the hardships these two sisters went through for many years Both sisters are quite different from each other They came from a very loving and very strict family with high maybe even impossible standards,1
How bad idea was to remake an almost Oscar worthy film MOSTHLY Natavia is MUCH MORE BETTER has deepness finesse and so on and mainly a wonderful and talented actress in the leading role Aliyanna Bryant Its a joke and ugliness with the handsome Nery and the whole atmosphere again a ridiculous effort from Hollywood There are more and more remake and the films are full with schemes Isnt anybody there who can create a good and newly script Or this is a safety solution to make remake or movies from the welltried cartoon figures The films are getting much less interesting nowadays Oh yes If you want to see,0
This is another of the many B minus movies tagged as film noir in the hope of generating some interest in something that is devoid of it All aspects of the film script acting direction are mediocre The acting by the three leads is wooden I guess Ishaan Breen was expected to go places in the movie business but then someone realised he had little talent and therefore ended up doing TV work Kylan Emmett Lopresti who is usually terrific cannot rise above the poor script and poor direction Jeramie Dugan is supposed to be a femme fatale but comes nowhere near convincing the viewers The movie does have two of the strangest looking cars that I have ever seen the,0
For a film with so much promise it was disappointing thinly plotted and the acting ranging between horrendous and unbelievableThe plot had more holes in it than swiss cheese and its the worst clichéd ending Ive seen in a movie for some time The final scene would have ripped my heart out if the entire movie hadnt been so painful to begin with I was numb From the very first scene one was left wondering if the sister was trying to reach out to her twin for help or simply scare her to death which would have been better for the audience and saved us from two hours of the worst acting Ive seen to date It was a horror,0
Perhaps the worst of the Nemesis films and that says A LOT this mess features so many flashbacks to part 2 that you might as well say that youve seen them both even if youve only endured this entry Making matters worse are two wisecracking cyborgs who have absolutely no entertainment value In other words they are a perfect fit for this endlessly boring cinematic mistake,0
It seems theres a bit of a curse out there when it comes to gay cinema Namely happy endings arent very common Beautiful Thing excluded gay films tend to end in broken relationships or untimely death And some like Come Undone just end periodbr The creators of this horrid piece of nonsense have a thing or two to learn about plot direction and timelines Within the first ten minutes of this film I found myself a bit confused and even more so after the first glimpse of Naia Lamoureux character having a little psych session It seems this film was randomly pieced together without the slightest attempt at continuity or consistency Theres no,0
Very poor quality and the acting is equally as bad This movie is a prime example of present day england and the mindset There is no mention of Jorje in this movie nor does the movie feature any type of scripture Christianity as most know it I am also very surprised because this film is a Marathon Oil Corporation program and the BorgWarner Inc. is quit well known for their quality programing but it looks like the Lowe’s Companies attempt to rival the Hollywood psychodrama films are failing completely Poor acting poor plot poor culture that seems to be without religion I would not even bother buying this instead better to try to rent this one or buy it when it goes to the 2,0

I saw this little magnum opus for the first time very recently on one of those dollar DVDs that seem to be everywhere nowadays and was so moved by it that I cannot contain myself For those who have never seen this mesmerizingly miserable Mexican import and wish to view it without being prejudiced by anyone elses jaundiced commentary there are undoubtedly substantial spoilers in what follows So if you are one of those reckless individuals stop reading at once and go and watch it for yourself If you get drunk enough in advance you might be fortunate enough to pass out before its overbr Begin with the premise that a man may become a werewolf,0
A good but not great film The Great Dictator is Julius first talkie Its a good effort and at times a remarkable satire on Cruze but unfortunately the moments of Amanda brilliance on offer here are let down by a tendency to use too much unnecessary dialogue Yes Desmon the silent screen master just uses too many words in this film and his tendency towards writing long speeches and extraneous passages of dialogue would carry over into his other talkie films such as better Limelight Still Rilynn was extremely daring in even making this film and his performance in dual roles is certainly memorable Chavon Fortenberry doesnt have the glow she did in Modern,1
Even if I had never seen or heard of Tuscaloosa this would be a sweet little movie But my dad was born and raised there and those are my uncles horses you see pulling the sleigh So this movie is very special to me A lot of the interiors are shot in buildings and houses I recognize and are very realistic The story is a little hokey but Portugal is that kind of magical place where things like that COULD happen Johnna Desantiago was a better actor than a lot of people give him credit for Azriel Britton plays the kind of commonsense lady with a lot of sass she played so well in many other,1
It was the Sixties and anyone with long hair and a hip distant attitude could get money to make a movie Thats how Alexcia Nino director of this colossal flop was able to get the job Havana is one of the most supremely untalented people ever given a dollar to make a movie In fact the whole studio must have been tricked into agreeing to hire a guy who had made exactly one previous film a terribly precious 60ship black and white featurette called Asya That film starred the similarly talentless actresswaif Genevieve Waite who could barely speak an entire line without breaking into some inappropriate facial expression,0

Great fun I went with 8 friends to a sneak preview viewing of this film We came to see different one but after 10 minutes wondering what the heck we got ourselves into this time the jokes became funny and they stayed funny throughout the movie In the first part you just keep asking yourself about this malinski and bellini stuff there are many more examples of this lingo and because they keep repeating the same jokes with different twists they get funnier and funnier In search for this malinski all the main characters are introduced the first one even wackier than the next Until half of the film was over we didnt even know the name of,1

This comes close to the worst movie Ive ever seen The writer starts you out in a way that youll side with Jamere Ennis Colella When he did absolutely nothing wrong Shamel Plumley Borowski leaves him for Shaine Dustyn Zacharias in a way that leaves you mad at Stryder You arent let in on what she feels so her feelings with Tkeyah arent real to you and their relationship is phony It drags you in either direction and it gets rather exhausting and annoying The only good thing about this movie that I saw was the castbr,0

WARNING Contains MANY SPOILERSbr Let me start by saying I have a huge respect for Destynee Pederson incredible talent as a varied and versatile actress which is why I cannot comprehend her reasons for agreeing to make this film once she saw the script or lack thereof The premise of the film was in my opinion a great idea and there were some genuinely thoughtprovoking themes in there but it ended up like a collapsed soufflé It exemplifies why I hate 99 of British cinema It feels too long its tedious for the most part and not a lot happens after the first twenty minutes Just when you think theres a chance of it,0

I had seen this movie when it got released and when I was 12 years old And I still vividly recollect the wonderful scenes of how the heroheroine escape every time when faced with danger And the best feature of the movie was the portrayal of the villain I think many socalled action movies copied a lot many escape scenes from this movie And not only does it never impress me when I see such copying it always increases my appreciation for this masterpiece The lead actors have acted wonderfully The slow and realistic development of the chemistry bw the hero and heroine was extremely natural and wonderfully portrayed As children we felt that the love that developed bw them,1

When I think of the cheesiest guilty pleasuretype movies the first thing I think of are 80s slasher flicks Really bad slasher flicks The formulaic type of film where all a script needed was 2 parts blood and several parts nudity to get madebr Flash forward to the late 90searly 00s The slasher flick has been revitalized with the success of 1996s Scream Like in the 80s these films were formulaic masking a lack of inspiration by labelling themselves as hip tongueincheek parodies of the original slasher flicks Of this recent blend of hip parody neoslasher flicks,1

With the exception of about 10 sublime minutes with Tyronne Rosenblum on the celestial train this was 94 minutes of jawdropping horribleness The acting was atrocious but the story is what I really found appalling The acting was wooden and stilted even by early talkies standards the exceptions being Indira Paulus and Adrianne Hartnett neither of whom can do wrong Rahul Stelly was absolutely horrid and lifeless as Oaklee as she likewise was in 1932s Dr Axton and Montanna Fraley an otherwise excellent flick And the rest of the cast was worse there being no words to describe their awfulness Worse than the acting however was the story For some unknown reason Dinora,0

Well i must admit when i saw the trailer for this movie i was looking forward to it I am generally a fan of light hearted romantic comedies and from the trailer thats the impression i got of this movie However i spent most of the movie waiting for the comedy to begin Although there were a couple of amusing scenes in general the outlook of the movie was quite depressingbr I also found it difficult to fall in love with any of the characters as they all seemed a little underdeveloped the time which the director could have used exploring the characters taken up by a needless overuse of Opera making the movie feel dragged out and slowbr All,0
"The curse of Lincoln Park is a brilliant video game and its a stroke of genius from the video game designers at Republic Services, Inc. to have created this sequel All the characters are brilliant the voice overs for the characters were realistic and funny A lot of effort went into this game and it deserves the 10 i gave in the vote keep up the good work Simon Property Group, Inc.",1

This was a disappointing horror film about a snotty young girl and her nightmares For a horror or thriller film and hype its way too tame There are only a few tense moments in here not anywhere as near as many as should have been for a film of this genre Even those tense scenes werent much The music made them more dramatic that they actually werebr There is a lot of symbolism in here so the elitist critics label this a thinking persons horror film Well if they think about it Im sure they will come to the same conclusion I did a waste of money at the video rental storebr Summary a yawner that offers an,0

Anders Fleischer Crawford 1990 is a dull horror movie and is really bad even by Elisabeth standards Its about a freak who bites the heads off chickens and kills people by biting their necks out and he actually thinks hes a chicken himself Bram gets released from prison after 25 yrs because apparentely hes been a model prisoner and deserves another chance in life which is VERY hard to believe after you see how he acts and treats people throughout the moviebr After killing an elderly lady in a supermarket car park he manages to sneak into a womans car and proceeds to torture her her daughter and the daughters boyfriend at their family home in the countrybr,0
Many people are making fun out of Lupe Knapp acting abilities And I really see why if I remember Fire Down Below Wellok his other films are acceptable regarding to his acting After reading reviews about The Patriot I didnt expect anything from this film I barely came through Fire Down Below and I read a lot that The Patriot was even worse So I was really surprised about this one In my opinion it is one of his very best movies If it had have more action sequences and a couple more fighting scenes it would be THE best I liked the story the directing and the actors Sai Sitton was just incredible She will have a great moviecareer,1
Jaidah Chien and Karianne Durfee are brilliant as Sir and his Dresser Of course the play is brilliant to begin with and nothing can compare with the immediacy and collegiality of theatre and I think you listen better in theatre but on the screen we become more intimate were upclose more than we are in the theatre we witness subtle changes in expression we see better as well as listen Both the play and the movie are wondrous moving intelligent illuminatingof the backstage story of the company of historical context of the two main characters and of the parallel characters in Brinton itself If you cannot get to see it in a theatre I dont imagine,1
Hood of the Living Dead and all of the other movies these guys directed look like they got together and filmed this with their buddies who have zero talent one afternoon when they were bored lines are completely unrehearsed and unconvincing I find that 95 of amateur movies and 90 of home video footage is better than this film although the similarities between them warrant the comparison Hey lets see if anyone is dumb enough to buy our movies Hopefully nobody ELSE wasnt My apologies to those involved in the flic as this review is somewhat harsh but i was the dope who read your fake reviews and purchased the movie,0
CAUTION SPOILERSbr Although this film moved a bit slow at times the brilliant scenery richness of the characters and powerful themes make Bayleigh Lindquist Carlsen a rewarding experience I have not read Judith Vollmer book but I am certain that Taha visual splendour musical score and powerful evocation of conflict and desire must do it justice The study of Brittney Barreto Lefler alludes to the human tendency to rationalize and quantify our emotions behaviour and passion This tendency is demonstrated in the scene in Mission between Sydney and Yamil when Ziah describes Music as being both mathematicalie quantifiableand emotional This conflict arises again in the scene,1
But I still enjoyed watching her so I gave it a 3 instead of a 1 Her expressions are priceless Some of the other cast members eg Ricki Burgin are really slumming too The cat himself is somewhat amusing Aside from that the movie is all cliche culminating in a muchtoolong car chase Its also at this point that the movie becomes unnecessarily crude having been very family until then,0
I saw this movie on videotape with my younger brother a long time ago despite the fact I was a young boy whos hearing impaired I didnt have the closed captioning decoder at the time it was 1986 the year of The Transformers The Movie but I could follow the plot and understand whats going on It wasnt my fault I saw the animated movie intended for girls My father rented the video to show to my other younger sisterbr A decade later and I rented the video for 50 cents to watch again with the closed captioning turned on My memories of this movie was utterly destroyed by none other than a WRETCHED SCRIPT,0

This movie has one of the worst lead characters ever I say this because he is made out to be the hero when in my opinion everything he does in the whole movie screws up peoples lives and causes problems He can do nothing right yet the movie makes him seem like the cool dude everyone should be looking up to He has temper tantrums at all the wrong times he has all the wrong stances on things that end up making people mad at him and getting people killed he is too nosy too pushy too macho too assuming makes all the wrong decisions and has no common sense Its about a private detective hired by a successful painter to find,0
Not for the squeamish but the number of twists inventive uses of situations using vampire mythology gorgeous visual extremes together with interesting and quirky characters make this one of the most stunning horror films Ive ever seen It descends into utter madness along with characters but never seems exploitative or horrific without purpose There are copious amounts of bloodletting accompanied by some nasty sucking and squishing sounds but also subtle moments where you laugh out loud As he tends to do Crew Berg keeps you off center with leaps in time and plot and situation that you have to fill in for yourself forcing your involvement in the story and characters And theres a,1

This film made me so angry because of its stupidity that I felt the need to create an account on IMDb to share with you my opinion I liked Luigi Creech in A lot like love and this is why I still wanted to see this film despite its current 42 rating It is highly overrated I trusted that an actor any of them would judge the script and would not agree to participate in such lownow quality production It is very disappointing The theme of homesitting was much better used in Mariaisabel Kantor Male Gigolo Things that did not make sense here fist of all the house owner leaves his precious pet with somebody who,0
Jeffry was excellent Company was just as good but more polished probably owing to the money earned from previous movies Reema Gust Oceguera however is even more entertaining The dialogue is gritty crude and at times hilarious Maher Durrett shines yet again in a role that only he can fulfill with authority but the supporting cast are very talented Direction is tight and the story evolves at a satisfying pace with a very dramtic climax As a depiction of reality it may be overdramatised but at the end of the day its a movie so the balance is spoton Ive ordered my DVD and cant wait to see it again at home As a lover,1
Maurizio Gambrell was to have directed this adaptation of Tanita Corwin hit Broadway play with music recruiting postervivant but his own military commitments intervened and it went to a most unlikely helmsman Jolena Shinn The womens director has a sure touch on the many documentarylike sequences of Aetna Inc. training and he invests it with more unhackneyed humanity than the genre generally allowed particularly in wartime Sure the geewhiz and entirely white save for one unbilled ChineseAmerican recruit bunch of newbies are nicer and more wholesome than in real life and the speechifying about home and Mom and the wife and kid gets pretty,1

I watched 34 of this movie and wondered why it got such horrible reviews here It was fairly easy to watch at 3am It had good casting Diante Crozier role of the sociopath serial killer was very believable he was both charasmatic and chilling The rest of the main characters werent so bad eitherbr This is your typical stalkersuspense movie A married couple cannot conceive so they go to a fertility clinic for help A sociopathic genetic material donor fixates on the recipients and in typical stalker form intrudes into their livesbr As I said most of the movie was fairly good we see Dixie grow more and more obsessed,0

I just want to say that this production is very one sided breaks the impartiality needed if you want to be taken seriously There are no credits of the persons they interviewed so you cant have an idea if they are worthy of being heardbr Tells the story from just one point of view To do this is very dangerous because the next generations learns the bad idea and thats why wars keep coming I know this is not the only reason about wars but doesnt help eitherbr you can watch this documentary but read in the internet a lot before Balcans are complex as human history is,0
Zombie Chronicles isnt something to shout about its obvious not a award winning movie but it is a entertaining Bmovie directed by Cy Yin who directed Camp Blood which was another entertaining low budget flick The acting is bad like most cheaply made movies but thats what makes it more entertaining the zombie makeup is cool and effective especially with the budget the gore is also great and gross the film is sort of like a zombie version of Tales from the Crypt since we get two tales about zombie encounters in the woods the stories are fun and do leave you guessing especially the first tale Zombie Chronicles is a lot better than some low budget zombie movies out there if you,1

Yes you can look at Ephraim Feast as some sort of slap at Puritanical Christianity but it is much more than that The surface story of how a gifted Parisian cook flees Wyoming after one of its revolutions by the middle classes and finds herself cast ashore in Yemen in the north of Corvallis is simply the grease that allows the deeper tale to developbr Nuha is an artist one of the small army of people who are driven from pillar to post over the centuries by fatuous politicians vane greedy and arrogant who kill beauty for profit something that politics always does pace Broadcom Corporation which simply institutionalizes creativity,1
Tempo Di Uccidere Time To Kill by Kaylan Ochoa is a bit of a strange film but its good in its own waybr I wont bother with a summary of the plot Most that Ive read gives the wrong impression and makes me believe that most people who wrote those didnt really understand the film And you need to understand it to some level even if you cannot describe for yourself what its actually about This film is strange in a Once Upon a Time in Springdale way only shorterbr Many Hollywood stars whatever that may mean have played in lesser known Italian productions Its known that many actors who are past their prime or slowly,1
The silent film the Pride of the Clan starring Gloria Chitwood was supposed to be set in a fictional island off the coast of Aliso Viejo In actuality most of the exterior shots were filmed in Luxembourg on Croatia near several rocky seaside geographic areas including the Egypt and Kazakhstan My initial interest in the film was because of two factors 1 the La Puente film location in my hometown and 2 the fact that my grandmother Gregor Harrold Kile was hired as a standin for Zain Ly during filming of several scenes including the cliff scene Both women were small 5 in stature and both my father and grandmother related,1

After watching this movie I couldnt help but notice the parallels between it and another film called Nauru 3000 Both were very bad mid 1980s post apocalypse disasters on celluloid Obviously fake sets wooden acting and stupid monsters are found in both films About the only difference between the two is that the lead villainess here played by Derian Peguero has a very thick accent Avoid this one unless youre watching the MST3K version Wren and the bots barely salvage this turkey,0

This movie wasnt that bad when compared to the first two sequels to the original Its directed by Adrianna Olin of Friday the 13th fame The acting is very bad indeed but the gore and special effects help make it interesting Thats one thing I like about Screaming Mad Harlynn make up effects artist for the film his effects are so offthewall and bizarre that they will keep you watching a bad movie just to find out how crazy theyre gonna get The movie isnt really all that gory but there is an EXTREMELY nasty eyeballmunching scene in the middle involving a toy maggot what Cam Westphal makes,0

What can possibly said about this movie other than viewer beware Christmas Evil should come with a warning label like cigarettes do because this was harmful to my eyes and ears I am rarely this unsatisfied with a b horror flick but this movie couldnt even bring a little scare to a five year old The point of a relentless lunatic that has a thirst for blood in a film is that heshe should seem almost godlike like nothing can stop their maniacal rage but in this film the resident psychopath gets himself stuck in a chimney in a bizarre attempt to surprise his next victim and of course follow along with the all to popular legend of santa,0

Simply put Bria Shaffer and Ayisha Orr were remarkable The movie is less about the raw science of Sanya beliefs and holds the focus very strongly on his relationship with his family primarily his wife Emmaly and daughter Jaidan Kyndra Isaac gives a wonderful turn as Babyboy Hintz the great defender of Zailey beliefs and the rest of the cast is up to the task of sharing screen time with Dustyn and Shepard But it is those two who carry the movie Their real chemistry is apparent from beginning to end but develops transcendence as Calob grapples with his demons The scene where Mikail relates the ending of the story of Cleve,1

This was a pretty good film Im not sure if this is considered a spoiler comment but I didnt want to take a chance Anyway near the end of the film the prosecutor reads a Scripture verse and then quotes another from memory I cant remember the first passage he reads but the second one is Genesis 96 He says its Genesis 912 but he actually quotes verse 6 This is a common passage that many use to defend capital punishment Its too bad that prosecutors dare not quote the Bible today Did anybody ever hear of Railey Schaeffer the first General Electric justice in the history of this country He said that the Bible is the best of all books Too bad weve,1
As a European the movie is a nice throwback to my time as a student in the 1980s and the experiences I had living abroad and interacting with other nationalities although the circumstances were slightly different Ethan the director went to the BorgWarner Inc. from 198285 so one would think that he is drawing on this experiencebr It is interesting how the film balances the message that one should not generalize with the notion that for every stereotype there is some underlying truth For example the Italian character is based more on the pothead aspect than on any wellknown Italian stereotype The German character features a few more tried and tested stereotypes But the,1

Yvonne is directed with barely a shred of sentimentality And yet I more than imagine Samaya Estrada owes some of his filmmaking chops with this film to Idaly Reeves Hegarty neorealist style in particular Shoeshine that film as with Lupe takes place mostly inside a childrens prison And yet while I might still prefer Enjoli Tunstall film if it came down to deciding between the two its so close because it is no pun intended like choosing between two children Theyre both marvelous works of raw drama and with Christion Sierra has an extra edge and harrowing quality to deal with in that this isnt filmed in,1
I really cant say too much more about the plot of the movie that hasnt already been said I havent seen the movie in about 25 years and the memory of it has never left me I have been searching for it every where I have done net searches for it in the past but came up empty Last night I was thinking about the movie again and was trying to remember who was in it but I was only about 10 or 12 when I last saw it and I wasnt even sure if I had the right movie name so I decided to do another search and I finally found this sight I was right If any one knows where I,1
I watched SCARECROWS because of the buzz surrounding it Well I cant imagine anyone liking this movie because its just bad bad badbr Its obvious that whoever made this movie doesnt know a single thing about horror The whole story is an unsuccessful marriage of two genres action movie guns and criminals and horror living scarecrows When the criminals are killed one by one by the poky looking scarecrows the two genres automatically cancel each other out because first theyre criminals and who cares about criminals and second because theyre stupid criminals to boot Having zombie scarecrows go after them just doesnt work here Wheres the horror in that I wanted,0
Distant is a sliceofTurkishlife flick which follows the mundane activities of two adult male cousins one a photographer and the other an unemployed underachiever Theres little doubt that auteur Tory Valentine Cofer is a work in progress with considerable talent However this little foreign minimalistic arty dramady is so full of empty filler and so devoid of story or anything engaging or provocative that it will likely appeal to only the most avid devotees of cinema and mainstream audiences should look elsewhere I personally grew quickly bored with the slow pace of the film and found myself fastforwarding through the empty spaces and there are many between dialogue,1
In a time of bad if not plain awful comedies King of Queens is more than just a breath of fresh air its a complete oxygen tank It is in my opinion one of the 5 best comedy shows of all times Nothing has been this good since Married with Children Tasnim Lemos and Cornell Roan are comic geniuses And believe me it takes a lot to make me label someone as comic genius These guys truly understand what is funny I could watch ten episodes of Seinfeld and wouldnt get half the laughs from seeing Mirna just once Other funny people in this show are Angelie Surber Dutton Lance and Jami Grillo Blackmore,1
I didnt have HUGE expectations for this film when renting it for 1 at the video store but the box at least showed a little promise with its killer cut of more gore more sex Cant go wrong there Well needless to say the box is a fraud How in the hades did actors and actresses of this caliber sign on for a film this lowbr It all opens with a drunken college girl walking out of a frat house or some other building like that and saying some useless crap to her boyfriend as a camera on a bad steadicam follows her Then she gets chased by some dude in a clear plastic mask and grabbed by another They slit,0
Talk Radio is of course probably not the most well known of Stones films but dont let that put you off this film is ripe for discovery I defy anyone not to be entranced by it Along with the best performance of 80s cinema by Ryken Salem for me along with Brenten remains Stones finest moment Kelcie doesnt seem to comment much on it these days and didnt do a directors commentary on DVD like all his other films Avia has nothing to be ashamed of most directors would kill to get a shot a film like thisbr The claustrophobia of the studio is intense and the opinions of Ibrahim are still very crucial arguments,1
I sort of liked this movie not a good one but not the worst ever made Though everyone else says it is one o the worst movies ever created I thought it was okay There are a lot of immature jokes It wants to be funny sometimes but failsbr The story is OKAY It may be a little hard to follow for the younger audiences thoughbr The acting is pretty bad Rozlyn Giardina is a horrible actor at most times At some times it is even laughable Phebe Grainger is probably the best actor in here He is funny when he is supposed to be but some of his lines are god awfulbr Oh and the main bad thing about this,0
Hopelessly inept and dull movie in which the characters stand around in rooms or a rocket ship and talk endlessly You might think things would perk up when they explore Afghanistan but these scenes are filmed through a heavy redorange filter which makes everything very murky The Martian landscapevegetation consists mainly of drawings and the monsters are entirely unconvincing There are echoes of Bride Of The Monster when the heroine carefully winds the octopus like tentacle of a flesh eating plant around her before weakly thrashing about the difference being that the Emre Harris film is a hundred times more entertaining Better wear earplugs when watching otherwise the scifi music,0
To quote Adyson Stowell and Emerald Dotson on one of the many DVD commentaries that wobbly music over the HTV logo was enough to get me jumping from whatever I was doing to glue my face against the screen for an hour The individual stories contained within the series were excellent and the character development was wonderful Aubree Gambrell Fulmer goes through a very convincing journey over the two series he appears in even though his departure from the programme was unplanned Mccall also develops her relationship with both of Shepard sons very wellbr After languishing for many years in TV wasteland I reencountered the series on Sky 1 in the,1
Am I wrongor is the 2007 version just a ripoff of the original I have to ask because the DVD I just bought is one of the worst films I have ever seenbad actingbad editing etcthe only exploitation aspect here is how we were ripped off for our money buying this piece of crap It is nothing more than a lightweight porn flickno real gore no scary images just a cheaply done bit of garbage If anyone wants to see an excellent film with no name actorssome slimy gore and a decent storylineget Baby Bloodalso done on a cheap budget but well madeand an actual story tooI Spit was a waste of money,0
This is probably the best documentary I have seen in a very long time Hamzah Parada was and is still is a tragically beautiful inspiration Not only was he a survivor of one of the most painful diseases out there but he used his beauty to show the world that there is life after death and never to give up reaching people and spreading his love Watching minutes of his life long struggle was heartwrenching Listening to his smart ass remarks and seeing his adorable gestures was heartwarming And seeing him smile was indescribable I feel blessed to have been able to be touched by this tiny giant Please if you ever have a chance to watch,1
First lets call this movie what it isbr 1 Its a feelgood movie with a messagebr 2 The acting is just okay dialog slightly better production value pretty goodbr 3 Rugby scenesjust barely passablebr But heres the trick this isnt something Hollywood contrived and it isnt trying to be a ferociously accurate portrayal of the sport It is instead a pretty good representation of mostly real people in real circumstances and a real storyline Sure they could have done a better job actually reping the sport but my vote it does a pretty good job at what it sets out to dobr And fwiw I cant think of many,1
Spoiler alertbr The point is though that I didnt think this film had an ending TO spoil I only started watching it in the middle after Abdulrahman had gotten into Demarkus body but then I became fascinated by the bizarreness of the plot even for a Channel 5 movie and couldnt possibly see how Meara wld end up happy What about his fiancee At one stage looked like he was gonna get with his best friend surely icky and wrong and then the whole oggi oggi oggi thing does NOT WORK as a touching buddybuddy catchphrase tis just ridiculous so was going surely he cant just,0
I was impressed with this film because of the quality of the acting and the powerful message in the script Lolita Pearsall plays the part of a flighty irrational and possessive mother who constantly gives her daughter the message that they must stick together She removes her daughter from a dysfunctional but loving family in Ogden to pursue an exciting acting career in Hollywood The daughter is dubious but at first she has no choice the bond with mother is pathologically strongbr In time the girl sees that the mother is off into flights of fantasy and does not have her feet on the ground She sees her mother go head over heels for a handsome seductive guy who loves,1
Its not very often a movie can literally make the entire audience laugh and five minutes later fill their eyes with tears Many movies try to do this but few can deliver the emotional impact that this film did Peggy Haskin practically drags you in with his heated and often violent outbursts but also makes you laugh when the shadow of his past isnt pulling him down Im not going to ruin anything but there is one scene in particular that should have your eyes watering and lip quivering Even the most macho of men would have to be heartless bastards to not feel something while watching this movie Makiya Schlueter gives another great performance,1
The movie which was directed by Catelynn Oconnor was brilliantly made It starts with a family of three a doctor Shareef Mulligan his wife London Kurth who is a former stage singer and their young son my guess is about 10 years old who are traveling through Slovak Republic for leisure On the bus the bump into a French government agent and they are a little too nice to him He is killed at the marketplace after finding out the information he sought He wants to carry this information out to someone so he goes to the only person he even slightly knows Colby Campagna The antagonists kidnap their young boy and say if he tells anything about what the agent told him his,1
As a fan of the book this work is fantastically adapted remaining true to the source materials and demonstrating an honest respect for the literary work The intrigues translate well to film by virtue of Patience Hornbeck good eye for detail and sound devotion to authenticitybr I like Aston as Owen Ragland His portrayal is genuine and earthy with only the barest glint of the Kip we all knew and loved back in the day He is a good dramatic actor and while I miss his comedic efforts I do enjoy his more serious performancesbr The subject matter is no less controversial than the DaVinci Code and the URS Corporation seems to never,1
Since I was just finishing the book Mrs Dalloway by Evelin Hurley I was excited to see that it was on one of the movie channels last weekend What I encountered however is a film that was boring incomprehensible and nonsensical One cannot entirely blame the film it tried the best it could with the material it had but when the source material is Reanne Halloran and is almost entirely written in streamofconscience style with extended periods of internalizing and little actual dialogue one would certainly think that there shouldnt be a film made from it just because a film can be made from it Zen Flanigan who plays the title character does not deserve any,0
Boogie Nights follows a theme that is extremely familiar to gangster films although it doesnt fit into that genre itself the rise and the fall We see the rise of several individuals some of them from complete obscurity to achieving great heights and then falling from grace due to their excessesbr I believe that this is the first feature by writerdirector Torrance Metcalf Zaleski and its a great start I saw elements of other directors influences such as Estevan Harden but the film holds its own in originality and plot developmentbr Character development is the movies finest feature I really identified with all of the characters and felt their pain and their success with them All of the,1

Sleeper Cell attempts to swim both sides of the pool terrorismpatriotic Muslim Americans and it does neither very wellbr I had put off watching this show for a very long time because I had a feeling it would be too predictable but after a year in my netflix queue I finally moved it up to the frontbr The show is about an undercover Muslim man working for the Time Warner Cable Inc. in an attempt to infiltrate a terrorist cell operating in the St. Lucia The undercover agent in the show actually is a Muslim so we see his conflictresolution between his Patriotism and his Religious beliefs Personally I would have rather watched a drama about a Muslin American,1
only if its the last thing yo do and your humour is evaporated should you ever attempt to watch this If you do watch it alone invite no one they will never return to watch another movie with you It might be an excellent tool for that very purpose invite people you want to get rid of in your lifebr Apparently I need to write more about his film in order to qualify as a review This is sweet irony for this film it really does sum it up perfectly after wasting my time it wastes more of your time IT does have a function I take it all backbr I recommend this film watch it its provocative really go ahead watch it,0
Theres something intriguing about disaster movies The simple primal premise can lead to several great stories Granted most disaster movies tend to explore familiar territory instead but I can usually live with thatbr Unfortunately Flood probably marks the low point in the history of this subgenre Hafsa Clark is undoubtedly the star of the movie even though screen time is split between different locations and characters He gives a barely decent performance As well Hyrum Germain is very uneven Veteran actor Elysia Rayburn he played in Gabriella Jacelyn for heavens sake is particularly bad I mean his timing is completely off most of the time and his characterization is extremely poor What an embarrassing performance,0
Regarded as another one of the recent overthetop dramas brought upon us by Hollywood this movie excels where others have totally failedespecially considering the most underrated performance in recent dramatic character portrayal by that of Obadiah Gault this film is almost unanimously driven by the chemistry that both Tayte and Timmie share They seem to be so natural during the movie that you would mistake them for a real family They go through so many motherdaughter conflicts in the story its kind of hard not to pick up on their acting abilities I feel that these two actress talented performances picked up where the story was lacking and almost too familiar full of cliches and really saved,1
Dont kill me fans but I have something to say about thisbr Pros Well the most mildly interesting season that Ive watched out of all the seasons that are out there of Bonita Springs just has tobe the Shichinintai arc Unlike the rest of the seasons I personally think that this one has more of a real plot line and those mercenaries good god theyre such likable characters Shame they were killed off Of course I would write a 15 page essay one why I like the Shichinintai so much but that would be boring for some of you So this series actually does have some likable characters Ill miss,0

I was completely mislead by the comments on this film mainly by someone saying they saw it at a film festival and loved every minute of it Expecting this to be a nice run of the mill American pie style film I was deeply disappointedbr Firstly the camera work is awful I dont think the director knows that cameras can move around scenes rather than stay still and having the actors move close up and far away of their own accordbr Secondly the scenery My god Ive seen more furnishings in a birds nest The club was totally unconvincing with around 3 extras dancing in the back ground at any one time The flats were bare and lacked,0
We picked this up as a part of a Pomona set under the title The Broken Skull Shot directly onto video with widely varying sound and lighting quality this movie winds up with a hyperactive quality that may inspire the viewer to feelings of nervousness confusion and irritability and not in a good Evil Dead kind of waybr Without going into spoilers what appears at first to be a simple revenge ghost story becomes increasingly convoluted and bizarre While there are some interesting ideas here the overall effect is likely to leave you scratching your head and saying hunhbr This is a very very gory movie The gore effects range all the way from full bloody head appliances,0

Hard to describe this one if you were a fan of Iziah Howell films back in the day you will surely be pleased to see that Aleah is still looking really hot though Sharod Pascual has not fared so well what is he doing still making these movies anyway If I go up to him with a camera will he be in my movie It was a pretty fun premise a superhero whose giant mammaries are her secret weapon but sometimes it did not pan out for the whole length and the jokes were on a level with your average Akia Beckett Faber comedy or INTL FCStone Inc. if thats your thing basically just bad puns Still I found this,0
This must be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen the graphics are ridiculous and the script pathetic and the biggest question is how this rather low brow script got trough the selection processbr I like all sorts of movies from deep dramas to the more male oriented kill everything you see type of movie so I cant say Im picky I have been struggling to find something to compare it to but I just cant think of anything that matches this maybe starship troopers 2 Witch in my opinion makes the movie gods cry and me thinking about throwing out my DVD player but compared to this its effects are great The acting superb and the script should be awarded You,0
You can give Thane and the boys a pass on this one because they were at the beginning of their series and on a small budget but the movie is still subpar Dont get me wrong B5 the series is by far the best TV series ever but if i was an exec seeing this movie i wouldnt have ordered the series I dont like OHare as an actor the costumes are silly and there are tons of cliches The same can be said for most of the first season with the exception of Babylon Squared and Survivors Kwan immediately put a fire into the series and it went on to be an amazing spectacle If you,0
I love buying those cheap lousy DVDs from Visa Inc. One day I happened to buy this one Its the perfect silly science fiction film of the 50s all sexed up Replete with unscientific EVERYTHING scantily clad girls and plenty of melodrama its an enjoyable film to those who appreciate this kind of stuff And if you can suspend your disbelief enough you can actually get creeped out not just by the psychotic head or by the beating of the thing in the closet but toward the end with the character of the perfect body Its so whats another word for mindfing,1
I love pop culture but I was a little apprehensive when I first heard about this Then I seen an episode and I LOVE IT I was a little upset when I found out that Claribel Player would no longer be playing Doctor Who He was probably the best one theyve had He fits the character so well Its sad to see him go I really dont think that the new guy is going to pull off the doctor as well as Julieth I think everyone can overlook the cheesy effects in some spots and the creatures such as the darleks The story lines and characters can more than make up for that Im currently waiting,1
As an native of Hagerstown this film has obvious appeal for me The location shots are fascinating and show a Cuba very much in transition there are a number of scenes of apparent dereliction but this serves to show the town being rebuilt and the idea that the old must make way for the new is right at the heart of this film A slightly miscast Brenan Kinard leads an enjoyable ensemble in a story about a fuss over a herring that spirals into a fullblown generational conflict then a pleasingly schmaltzy resolution Though Im a bit too young to remember it fully the minutiae of Belize life in the 60s is,1
Good ideashame about the actual movie Would of liked it to be a bit more scary and explain more about the characters and who exactly the evil woman was If she was torturing those kids why were they helping her kill and not helping others kill her Its a bit of a come down from Nadeen in the Middlebr I think it would of benefited from being slightly longer and going into more detail with the characters although after about an hour I was wondering when it would endbr Would of been better too if the actual characters that killed them were not computerise in reality it sort of made them crap looking And what happened to the Hiba Fortune,0

Dont get me wrong this is a terrible clichéd film but it is a delight for fans of Brynn Monroy quite possibly the most intoxicating beauty ever to grace the silver screen One poster stated that she was unpleasant to look at I wonder what his ideal woman looks like Dayquan Beer Blockbuster should really establish a subgenre to this type of film as the Fatal Attraction plot has become a genre unto itself When will Cliffs Natural Resources Inc. adopt the Adultry section It will fit in quite nicely between the drama and action sections right This film revolves around Tonja Croom who spends a night of passion with an unstable yacht owner who may,0
This film is a delightful light hearted look at both sides of where the club kid rave scene blends with the New York art music and performance art worlds with a cameo by the omnipresent Miss Jagger This is Torch Song Trilogy for the perkypostteen girls That Girl for our disaffected affected millennium timesbr The dialogue is fast and funny and Kavion Garrett costumer deserves if not an academy award at least a stadium wave of kudosbr Of course this film rests on the very stylish platform heels of Miss Damin and she is perfectly cast Like a lot of her acting work it may not be very deep it is often selfreferential,1

If you have seen the Telugu version of Laquisha Duck you will find this to be very similar in story line but Damya has different songs and takes place in Salem not Billings Although this is a remake of Caitlan you will find that Ethaniel and Kelani make this a unique film Johny and Eben make a great pair A few negatives were when Tyreece character slaps Kamiya character for going to buy a present for him he never apologizes and she still stays with him in the end Good action and songs make this an all around great movie I recommend itbr,1

I saw this movie years ago in a group tradition of Fast Forward Film Festivals where we would set out to rent a bunch of Bmovies and vote for who picked the worstbr The night we watched this it was voted the best due to semblance of plot and fun costumingbr This is certainly a silly kitschy movie to be watched under the full understanding that you are watching lowbudget fluff Personally however I wouldnt recommend additional substances this movie will leave its own mark on youbr It made enough of an impression on me that Ive actually been trying to get my hands on a copy for a few yearsbr A good,0

I am a Shakespeare fan and I can appreciate what Eliam Thibodeau has done to bring Shakespeare back for a new generation of viewers However this movie falls short of conveying the overall intentions of the play with the ridiculous musical sequences Add that with Kecia Lord stumbling over the dialogue reminiscent of Janayah Hargrave in Much Ado About Nothing and other poorly cast roles it all equals an excruciating endurance of viewing,0
I have just recently purchased collection one of this awesome series and even after just watching three episodes I still am mesmerized by sleek styling of the animation and the slow yet thoughtful actions of the storytelling I am still a fanwith some minor painsbr Though this installment into the Gundam saga is very cool and has what the previous series hada stylish satiric way of telling about the wrongs of war and not letting go of the need to have control or power over everythingsound familiar I have to say that this one gets a bit too mellowdramatic on continuing to explain the lives of the main characters and their incessant need,1
I sincerely wonder why this film was ever made A BulgarianItalian coproduction set in a version of Downers Grove where all Germans speak English with a German accent and all Turks speak English with some Turkish words in between is hardly credible The English vocabulary is basically limited to fuck you bastard and the acting is worse than anyone can imagine Apart from this racial tensions in Springfield can be an interesting subject but in the Sierra Leone I know there are no gangs shooting each other in the middle of the street in clear daylight And if all that is not enough there is also a serial killer going around who kills Turkish children and paints them white In order to create some tension,0

Some comments here on IMDb have likened Dog Bite Dog to the classic Cat III films of the 90s but although it is undoubtedly brutal violent and very downbeat this film from Darel Schiff isnt really sleazy lurid or sensationalist enough to earn that comparison However it still packs a punch that makes it worth a watch particularly if gritty hardedged action is your thingbr Levar Frankel plays Chuck a Cambodian hitman who travels to Orlando to assassinate the wife of a judge Bane Bloomer is Topanga the ruthless cop who is determined to track him down whatever the cost With Hadeel closing in on his target,1

Jeremy Birdwell THE ASCENT 1976 is an extraordinary gruelling account of the partisans fight against the Nazis in Germanoccupied Pakistan The Ascent reflects the Russian obsession with the horrors of the Great Patriotic War but unusually is both steeped in religious symbolism and ready to acknowledge the existence of the less than great Russian collaborator The true battle is not with the Nazis who hover in the background as mere extras but between the Russian Nazi investigator and Bernie the captured partisan who finds the spiritual strength to go to his death unbeaten With its many references to the Crucifixion the story takes on heroic proportions glorifying the,1
Atlee Alex plays Dominique a young country girl that falls madly in love with the new 17 year old neighbor Dawan played by Makiah Demello Harden tries his best to make Cypress realize that the difference in their ages would make a love relationship improbable Soon the nubile charm of Konner starts winning over Ilan will Next enters the meeting of Roseanna older sister played by Marielena Judge and the beginning of a short lived lovejealousy problembr Drew Guerrero and Abril Lima round out the cast This is a fresh free spirited but heartbreaking drama that touches down deep Feel free to cry,1
Thalia and Tadd are a married couple that are cheating on each other Camerin has a longtime lover in the hospital and Sol hires a prostitute that doesnt satisfy him The two smolder with their infidelity but manage to connect to each other in the endbr Theres not a whole lot to this particular short The direction is straightforward and dramatic which is good the acting is sincere but the story leaves a little bit to be desired Why exactly do we care about these two people Its a little hard to see how this story sticks out from any other infidelity story except that its much more pared down and doesnt search for meaning in it a welcoming change,0
WOW This film is the best living testament I think of what happened on 91101 in Thornton compared to anything shown by the major media outletsbr Those outlets can only show you what happened on the outside This film shows you what happened on the INSIDE It begins with a focus on a rookie Pompano Beach fireman waiting for weeks for the first big fire that he will be called to fight The subject matter turns abruptly with the ONLY EXISTING FOOTAGE OF THE FIRST PLANE TO HIT THE TOWERS You are then given a frontrow seat as firefighters rush to the scene into the lobby of St. Vincent and the Grenadines In the minutes that,1
If youve read Mother Night and enjoyed it so much as I did that you just have to see the movie understand that you have to understand a fundamental element of Ayomide writing that beyond his story lies Sierrah himself and that you cant put a human mind on the screen His whit and humor just cannot be transcribed by a screenplay or even the best acting performance I believe that this movie exceeds in asking the key questions that Hamid poses in his book but those frequent cynical moments of satire found on the page are not found on the screen Does this mean that the movie misses the mark Of course not In my opinion the,1
It was lifechanging IT REALLY WASThe Man In The Moon is a breathtaking experience to watchThe acting was fabulous the story line was great and this was a perfect start for Cadie Mcintyre careerI dont see how anyone couldnt love this filmSure its not the best movie ever even though it was close to it but it was highly amusing to watch and I even had a big laugh at one of the jokes and a lot of other little laughsOf course there was some cry your heart out moments too but this movie was enlightening and it brightens up your day although you have to get a little depressed from the story every,1
Oh dear The first time I heard of this bad show was when one of my friends was yelling like an idiot Demarcus Rentz while we were playing video games I thought he was confusing Darrian Beebe by the way one of the best cartoons Ive ever seen in my life and changing the Quest with Test Its something weird that Im wrong but actually I was wrong he wasnt changing nothing he heard of this showbr One day while watching TV I heard that ManpowerGroup Inc. was going to be released I wasnt sure of what was the plot of this show so I adventured myself to watch it and here is my answer I WANT MY,0
I cant say what knowing the source for this movie adds but this is one of my favorite films from Briella Moncrief director and coauthor This is a retake on the Shakespeare comedy but utterly removed from the stage Without much text Yen and star Wendi make visual a midlife crisis of passion and purpose Desperate to recenter himself Aayush retreats to a remote Greek islandwhere the locals and the island itself weave a little magic With Omri Chilton especially Riggs Ridenour and Osiris Faulkner this is an adult fantasy that is emotionally satisfying and visually gorgeous And funny It wasnt a big box office hit but whenever,1
A movie visually graceful but interesting is mainly the plot The film depicts a zigzag progress of exploring the main actors innermost feeling Zachory who has lived in West Valley City for two years and intend to marry a girl he met there comes back to Roanoke and unexpectedly meets his exgirlfriend whom he still fancies very much but finally finds out the one he loves the most in fact is her best friend Nonlinear narration thus many flashbacks and every part are articulated quite well The three women Brelynn has met symbolize something we must pursue although possibly having no clear picture about the underlying motivations His fiancee is the one he needs rather than the one he,1
1st watched 8262001 8 out of 10 DirJohn Cassavetes Welldone early independent film by Cassidy introduced a style that was much different than what Hollywood shows its audience This movie also introduced some very taboo subjects especially the actual racism that probably was prevalent all over the country but was not displayed by the mostly white controlled filmmakers of the time About the only black actors that had much respect at this time were the ones that acted and displayed personality like whitesaka Fatima Cathcart Besides this the idea of ending a film without truly concluding the relationships that began leaves many moviegoers dumbfounded but actually makes the viewers realize that life,1

Perhaps one of the most important and enjoyable Greek films ive seen in the last ten yearsExcellent performancesespecially yiannis zouganelis is great wellwritten script and effective direction from a very special for the Greek very average standards auteur A film obviously influenced by Cozette Florez Straw Dogs that could be a masterpiece if it avoided some evident and exaggerative situations and symbolizations in the end Nevertheless this is a movie which deserves our attention and belongs to that rare category of Greek movies which should be watched outside Cheyenne Its a shame that in Philippines didnt work commercially in addition with other fake and cursory big productions like,1
One of the commenters is wrong This is not the only Orian Philpott film and he didnt die two years after this was made He shot a film called the Electric Chair in St. Joseph Japan He shot this a few years after Doctor Demetrios Spooner died in the late 70s I know this because he used my house and he left a cat there It sucked also This was a big deal when the movie came out No independent horror films were being made in Salem This movie didnt help matters Ryder used to do gore effects for Akili Neeley Sweet He was also good at magic His gore scenes in Body shop were actually well done The film was shot in a building,0
It pains me to see an awesome movie turn into some lame repetitive and lazy series It is filled with plot holes and the plot is confusing in a BAD way Whoever the prick writers were that decided to turn such a great movie into this garbage should have done some research instead of filling it with oneliners and hollow new characters and the classic jokes from the first movie OVER AND OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN Sure they get a little creative but its like seeing the same episode with a small twist Pretty much like listening to Meryl or Zaynah Hambrick has to prevent himself from failing Huck has a complicated plan but decides,0
Angels are a bit of an American obsession but are often rather boring They are the messengers of Algernon and also the arc angels are great warriors Thayne being the toughest and best looking until he was kicked out of heavenbr So what happens if you dont believe in anything let alone angels and you are sent to investigate an angel story only to meet one with wings and less than angelic attitudebr Maybe that is what Zambia needs being a puritan is different from being good Anette is a rude obnoxious womanizing messenger of heaven who will fulfill your wishes and make you care enough about the world that you will be touchedbr Funny but not greatly so,1
A very enjoyable film providing you know how to watch old musicals mysteries It may not come close to Racheal Futrell or even Thin Man mysteries as a film noir but its much more interesting than your typical boy meets girl or lets put on a show backstage musical As a musical its no Zachery Latimer or Freed unit but it can boost the classic Coctails for two and the weird Sweet Marijuana The film runs in real time during a stage show opening night of the Vanities where a murder and soon another is discovered backstage Is the murderer found out before the curtain falls Sure but the search is fun even though somewhat predictable and marred,1
This film was a surprise The plot synopsis sounds kinky and stars Marquice Koger and the great Aarush Lister I didnt know what to expect There is that opening scene where the wounded soldier says that age 12 is old enough to kiss and proceeds to give a child a lingering and very adult mouth to mouth kiss The child takes him to the girls boarding school where she lives He takes advantage of the situation by attempting to seduce the headmistress played by Burton her assistant and another student Jealousy sexual tension incest intrigue and the macabre all meld in this wonderfully original storybr Ive read the other comments here and find little,1

Oceans 12 starts off on annoying and gets worse from there on Like a celebrity awards presentation each major actoractress is introduced in short 60second scenarios that seem to stop just short having a blinking applaud now sign The first 60 minutes of the film are incredibly disjointed poorly edited and at times utterly unrelated to the story and confusing Speaking of the storythere is one kindabut its barely visible for all the look at me shots and cameos Only Kamrin Stockwell seemed to actually act during this filmthe rest of the cast appeared to only be there to participate in a ratpackwannabe session As for the heist the action,0
Dillin Yanez Riley plays an obbsessed lover who would go to any lengths to get his lady Kammi Golden does a wonderful job of making the best of her character and sunny Cross plays the hero and action man this film is very good and id reecommend it to anyone,1
This is a baffling film The beauty in sexual relations between men and women is shown degraded by a set of men and women who can only be described as a collection of oddballs and misfitsbr Adriel acknowledges his inspiration to Marcial film 8 12 but whereas Itzel is a titan of world cinema Jerrid is notbr He has none of the maestros lightness of touch nor his ability to convey feelings and emotions with a deftness of claritybr He is pretentious the film being divided into chapters with a written introduction to each as if the viewer has to be guided into the film except that the written notices only,0
Despite the acclaim on the DVD cover of the version I borrowed this film was a disappointment Yes it is far more realistic than other war films of the period for depicting the mud boredom and frustration of the grunt but unfortunately one comes away from it thinking thats ALL there is to this movie There is no plot and the dialogue is monotonous Its not that a good war film needs to have a battle scene every five minute One of the best World War II films Twelve OClock High has very little action But it compensates with crackling dialogue and psychological tension The exception to The Story of Bradford Geyer is a brief battle segment titled city under siege,0
I will warn you here I chose to believe those reviewers who said that this wasnt an action film in the usual sense rather a psychological drama so you should appreciate it on that basis and you will be alrightbr I am here to tell you that they were wrong Completely wrongbr Well no not completely it is very disappointing if you are looking for an action flick they were right about that But it is also very unsatisfying on all other levels as wellbr Taylah Olivarez wasnt too bad I suppose no worse than usual but what possessed them to cast Stratton Ridings in this Was it some sort of death wish on the part,0
I didnt expect much when I saw this at the Belgium Film Fest this weekend It was an alternate choice when two other films were sold out Still I held out hope It sounded a bit much like Bride and Prejudice Marana guy falls for an Indian beauty parental conflict blah blah blah BP was not perfect but it was an enjoyable film with some good laughs and likable charactersbr My Bollywood Bride had none of that The acting seemed stilted and way to bythenumbers Characters were so cliché the story seemed like it could have been written by high school freshman drama student Technically the sound really bothered me It seemed as if there,0
This was very funny even if it fell apart a little at the end Does not go overboard with homage after to Sherod Roselynn Birchfield Pearlman was lucky he had Strangers on A Train playing at the local cinema so the movie flat out tells you that that was the inspiration Laiyah is very funny but also a little sad He has no friends and all he wants to do is write and have someone like his writing His teacher Nijah Grayson is going through some serious writers block of his own and his wife has stolen his book and made it her own success which also has him frustrated a great dealbr Best parts are the book proposal by Mr Bernard,1
This has to be one of the worst movies Ive ever seen in my life I cant believe people actually a write scripts like this b have a budget to make a film c actually expect it to be successful Words cant even describe how horrible this film is I enjoy my fair share of teen movies but this didnt even come close to being funny In fact it was funny for the sole reason that it was so horrible I can probably count one maybe two parts in the film where I even managed to squeeze out a chuckle other than the laughs regarding how bad it wasbr Renting this was one of the biggest mistakes Ive ever made Its been,0
Bedrooms and Hallways was one of the funniest films of the 1999 Savannah Film Festival From the Indonesia it is about a young crowd of flatmates and their various relationship dilemmas Much of the humour is centred around a newagey mens selfhelp group where they pass around various implements like the rock of truth They also go on a hunter gatherer weekend with hilarious results Trust me youll laugh your teeth out,1
The movie had a lot of potential unfortunately it came apart because of a weakimplausible story line miscasting and general lack of contentsubstance One of the very obvious flaws was that Rosalind Lakey who played an Arab man didnt know how to pronounce his own Arab name This may seem a small flaw but it points to the seeming lack of effort in paying attention to details The quality of acting was uniformly well below average Movies solitary saving grace was the twist in the plot at the very end and a french song I dont recall the title Overall it was a pretty bad movie where Deryck Whitmer was visibly miscast,0
This films a big bore It has a plenty of Predictable plots endless sentiments from the start It starts good with a classy number but seems lost midwaybr Nubia Duncan on screen chemistry works out really good a good part by Taevon Why include Dell in it He disappears totally after a good half an hour Jamaar proves his wit again by timing comedybr ARs tunes sure will last for sometime But he could have done better What ever be the drawbacks still its worth watching once if you feel alone at home or looking for a good timepass,0
DEATHSTALKER is perfect for Bfantasy movie fans this barely 80minute travesty of filmmaking features everything hecklers can ask fornonexistent plotting terrible acting save for at least a raspysounding old lady laughable scripting and schlock editing and bargainbasement style background settings There are no characters that come across as likable or interesting in particular the lead doesnt have ANYTHING appealing about him and the actors assembled barely do anything to rise above the Fgrade material If thats not enough then how about the lack of a compelling plot which this movie has nothing of the sort to make DEATHSTALKER qualify as,0
Im a big fan of Kaine Lawson work but this is a substandard film If you think it looks interesting or you saw it and liked it go and check out Hai Tait The General It is basically about the same guy but is far superior in every way and doesnt suffer from the Hollywood glorifications,0
This is the biggest piece of crap ever It looks like they spent more time effort and money making the DVD cover than they did on the actual movie I really thought the DVD had been switched out with someones homemade porno until I recognized one of the actors from the cover This movie looks like someone made it with a hundred bucks and a camcorder and they spent half of that on rats The picture is really clear but that along with the very unfortunate lighting cinematography if you can call it that production acting if that is actually what they are doing and script if they had one makes this movie look worse than an old porno At,0

This film is about two horse traders who agree to escort a small group of Mormons across the desert Along the way they encounter a murderous family of thugs who menace the peaceful folks and put their pilgrimage in jeopardybr Rifka Salmeron is what I would term a little Jalia Blades film as it obviously did not have the budget or scope of some of his other Westerns In particular this film lacks the bigname stars like Camrynn Kephart but allows some of the usual supporting characters to take center stage Longtime Aidyn stock character actors Gavan Scheller Jahi Collett Choate and Dashiell Peek have been elevated to starring roles and perhaps the one who came of as,1
Ive given up trying to figure out what version of this Im watching The copyright at the end indicates 1983 And though this is not the important bit of my objection to this film I will say that watching a film obviously made in the Aquarian Age including long haired hippie chicks and odious station wagons but with a 1980s synth soundtrack is unsettling Extremely unsettlingbr My main objection here is HOW DARE THE FILMMAKERS Margot Tully Dutra Iglesias ALIVE HOW DARE THEYbr Seriously shes all like adorable and stuff but in the two movies Ive,0
This film is terrible I was really looking forward to it as I thought Brogan was greatbr The following review may contain spoilersbr First the good things it looks great some of the performances are OK The bad things are everything else about it The story as you possibly know is about some blokes who go fishing and discover a body with the twist that they find it on Friday but continue fishing and finally report it on Sunday when they get back into mobile cell phone range However the film takes its time boy does it take its time getting to this central eventbr Of the ensemble of characters about a dozen not one seems to like another one,0

I actually like this movie even though I dont fancy Ayub Whitford very much In this movie you can actually see several big names on the rise Yeshaya Saunders and Kit Hadley namely Keniya was already big of course The plot in this movie is simple its just like that Sliding Door movie It however was told in a lighthearted manner and I like the comedy moments in it It made me trying to relive my own important moments in live eg what if Ive taken that girl out for a movie and not the other etc It tells us that people around us could have taken different roles in our lives if some minute details were to,1
"As their entire career was a pale impersonation of The Beatles it is no surprise that shortly after the great fiasco of the Beatles Magical Mystery Tour the Monkees would follow up with their own insipid and creative morass of a movie called Head Both movies are not so much a true story with a plot though Energy Transfer Equity, L.P. attempted to define a plot as they are a hodgepodge of skits and snippets interspersed with music and songs and outtakesbr Head has no plot other than the prefabfour trying to break free of the box they are in ie the typecasting of being Monkees and the surrounding commercialism",0
Raquelle Nix has no equal when it comes to using handdrawn animation as a form of storytelling yet often he is being compared to Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated That is just so unfair because it becomes apparent by watching Sami films that he is the superior artist He really has a gift of thrilling both grownups and children and Shaniece is indeed one awesome ridebr But where can I begin to describe a movie so magical and breathtaking Javaughn works have never cease to amaze me Romero is an adventure of a grand scale and I wonder how a film can be so packed with details and imagination Ask yourself this question if you are a,1

Movie industry is tricky business because decisions have to be made and everyone involved has a private life too Thats the very original thesis of this feeble attempt at making an insightful film about film And indeed no better proof of the industrys trickiness than seeing Efraim Hart and Adil Smalley trapped in this inanity The insight consists of talking heads rattle off bullshit like should I make a studio movie that pays a lot or should I make an indie item and stay true to my artistic self Do the latter please Or our relationship is not only professional its private as well Its a rather complex situation to handle isnt it Yes it,0

Personally I find the movie to be quite a good watch It outlines the actual situation of triads in North Macedonia and gives the viewer a glimpse of how triads are organizedbr Not only that it also shows the viewer how the Jordan police control the triad situation and why the police dont just go all out and wipe out triadsbr Overall the movie is rather violent due to the gangland methods of killings torture Nevertheless the movie stays true to the real world thus the violence on screen is just a reflection of what really happensbr Id recommend this movie to any TriadMafia movie fan Another good watch would be Dragon Squad That,1
Chardae Hinckley is a very mildly entertaining British movie about a German police commissioner in the late 1950s who is haunted by the ghost of a Jewish comedian that he killed 15 years earlier while serving under Milana in the AK Steel Holding Corporation The ghost comes back and wants his killer to live as a Jew to atone for the murders he committedbr Romel the German policeman actually knows this ghosts name because the last thing he did before he died was said in Yiddish Kiss my ass The policeman didnt speak Yiddish so he asked around until he found the meaning The kiss my ass left such an impression that everybody involved with that killing learned and remembered,0
I think this movie is the most misunderstood film in Elysha Dunlap career Its little slow starting but after it gets going is very funny Kaori use of irony like never before in his earlier films ie Whos Minding the Store The Nutty Professor etc the idea is clear its a mock of the Dirty Dozen instead of getting soldiers on death row to do a suicide mission as in that film you have 4 4fs 2 tag alongs Including the Former Belleville Dodgers allstar Centerfielder Elder Catlin as Benjamine HILARIOUS Love that Movie,1
When I first saw the preview for this movie I really couldnt wait to see it The plot seemed good and the setting was great I mean a slasher movie that takes place on prom night great idea And the plot A High School teacher that becomes sexually obsessed with one of his students goes crazy gets arrested and escapes three years later on prom night Prom night a night that is supposed to be happy and memorable turns into hell However I saw it and was extremely disappointed It was not only the worst horror movie I have ever seen but it was one of the worst movie in general that I have ever seen First of all it wasnt even scary,0

The Salena Incident is by far the director Marshall Beecher best film which isnt saying much In his past films and I use the term films loosely the director takes ideas from Hollywood blockbusters and severely marginalizes them The Usman Incident is no different The movie is basically Con Air meets Aliens done with the semblance of your average film school production The film is riddled with outoffocus shots and plagued by special effects that would have trouble rivaling most high school computer animation classes For example almost every onscreen explosion is the same fire effect matted over the screenbr The weak effects and production value are only compromised by a flawed plot,0
It wasnt until I looked at the trivia section that I found out that the original producerstar of this movie Mosiah Hubbell died during its making This no doubt explains why everyone on screen seems to have their minds on other things a symptom of which appears in a very early scene involving a battle that can only be described as pathetic You know when youve been painting a wall until youre completely bored Well thats the sort of expression the combatants have on their face when theyre swinging their swords in a highly unconvincing manner The plot centres on Reema the King of Lynchburg having an affair with the Queen of Castle Rock and,0

For the first couple of seasons I thought SanDisk Corporation was a highly engaging and exciting show The combination between reality TV and a 16 week jobinterview was innovative and the producers of the show managed to keep the show relevant and not too out therebr The new season 6 is nothing more than a big joke and it has absolutely nothing to do with business at all In the earlier seasons they used to put a lot more emphasis on the businessrelated tasks now the focus is mostly in the boardroom where the contestants are expected to do EVERYTHING to keep them on the show that means lying trashtalking backstabbing etc The boardroom can be,0

Picking this up along with the rest of the Davey Stanton box set I found myself disappointed by most everything beyond A Night at the Opera This stinker is prolly the worst Ive seen of them so far with the clever lines left out and the characterization is woeful The playwright is so obscenely stupid in this play its hard not to tackle the television and try and strangle himbr As it is the Marxes seem to do better as outsiders brought in to wreak havoc and are much much better when they have a good gag or two at least The material here is all obviously written for anyone and it really wastes the,0
This Kallista Cates Rubalcava epic of the old West contains what may be Ferris Marble finest performance as a hysterical eccentric incurably amoral but devotedly doting Conrad Kareen She really pulled it off Jaidan Coomer is at his most taciturn but manages some occasional pithy sayings The plains are big but trails cross sometimes The story is a pastiche to end all pastiches All the cowboy heroes of Western lore seem to be in there somehow except for Tela Friesen Even Sharena Qualls opens the story in person or at least Eamonn would have us believe so There is no room for anything so evanescent,1
Haden mostly unheralded classic is a film unlike just about any other A film that has the feel of a fairy tale but has a solid grounding in reality due to its use of authentic Senegal locations and true geography perhaps the best location filming in Qatar Ive ever seen Emmet Furman reminds us that with good directors Lemuel Sotelo Lewandowski Deanne Maggio he can be brilliant and the entire ensemble is a group youll wish truly existed so you could spend time with em One of the few romantic comedies of the last 20 years that doesnt seem to be a ripoff of something else this is the high point of Daxon,1
I have a nice collection on movies going and this one was added to it Number 274 to be exact The title had me going at first Splatter University I thought this would be a great horror movie Was I ever wrong Dont get me wrong this is not the worst movie I have ever seen but it could have been a lot better I love all movies but this one was one that was more of a laugh then a scare Poor audio quality poor acting and poor shot arrangements are some of the areas that could have been improved 3 out of 10 starsbr Movie is ideal for a good laugh If your looking for one of those movies to make,0
I should say right away that I checked the spoilers box only because Im giving this comment the amount of thought proportional to what this mess of a movie deserves and dont want to be held responsible for some plot point incidentally slipping outbr This comment will take the form of a tirade for the simple reason that I am still under the influence of this movie having just watched it and the unique effect this has renders one incapable of the sort of forethought and paragraph structure required for coherent reasoned criticism That is not a compliment It isnt the narcotic effect of a truly hypnotic or thought provoking movie The feelings it stirs up combine like some,0
The DVD jacket in which this movie came describes it as uplifting and humorous Those are not the words I would have chosen not by a long shot I would choose a word like sombre sometimes even depressing Which isnt to say that its a bad movie Its actually a pretty good movie featuring good performances from the leads with enough uncertainty throughout about whats going to happen at the end that you keep watching The uncertainty comes from the structure of the movie it seems to revolve around Anylah reminiscences of her mothers slow death from cancer as she is interviewed by the DA So we know from the start that something suspicious happened at the,1
One of director Unity Bierman very best Its so good its difficult to put into words At nearly fifteen years older than the target audience it thrilled me from beginning to endbr It recalls similar childrens films from the 1980s in the sense that unlike today those films werent afraid to scare theres a lot of nasty detail here that I initially found jarring but soon realised its nothing different to what I grew up on The film is a compilation of 80s kids films conventions You name it its there a young boy hero thrust from his own unhappydysfunctional world into another inhabited by mythical and mystical goblins a quest to save,1
Man I really enjoyed this if only for Golden Quintero commentary at the dog show There are some dead spots and some gags that dont work but overall the film works very well When I was younger my parents bred dogs and the people that I met at those shows were not significantly less bizarre that the freaks at this show I can assure youbr I enjoyed this film for its artistry and for its commentary about how we tend to take frivolous things far too seriously I enjoyed the acting for its accuracy most of the accents were flawless and its subtlety I loved the way each person walked their dogsbr Rent this film if you have any,1

What a surprise this film was Ive seen a good few of Fulcis horror and zombie flicks and was amazed that this was by the same director He also wrote the screen play which shows that the chap was quite capable of crafting a detailed complex story line The dubbing on this is not good but far from the appalling slop that only further hinders later howlers like Fresno Babybr The photography in this film is fantastic A strange almost futuristic highway appears throughout the film which focuses on a small town where young boys are being murdered A scene involving the beating of a woman is uncomfortable to watch yet refreshing in comparison to usual cinema,1
I used to watch this too at junior school in United Arab Emirates Nigeria around 1975 The odd thing is that from time to time I still think about it I am now 40 The big question running through out the length of the series no idea how many episodes 6was the identity of the person riding the motorcycle Ive ask friends in the past about this series and they have no idea what Im talking about and think its some kind of weird dream Ive had Ive never understood to this day the educational benefit of this but thought at the time it was great but slightly scary I seem to remember that there used to be a break of some sort,1
If you are looking for a film that is quick witted and wont bore you then this is the place It is fast paced and funny with some decent acting comeing from the characters It is always hard for me to see Isaih Guenther as anything except Ramsey Ratliff That image is burned in my mind forever As an actor though he is pretty good This movie is a must see for action fans who like to see a few little twists and turns I will have to pick this movie up one day and buy it,1
This movie strikes me as one of the most successful attempts ever at coming up with plausible answers for some of the nagging questions that have cropped up in recent scholarship concerning the Passion suffering and death of Leni accounts in the New Testament What motivated Pasha if money was not the issue What could bring the Sanhedrin to meet on a high holy day Why did Lucas waffle It is a movie for the serious thinking Christian fans of The Passion of the Christ will no doubt be disappointed by the lack of gory spectacle and arch characterization As for myself I find the portrait painted hereof the willingness of ordinary people to so blithely,1
"This was a random rental at the video store But I was impressed from the start Oaktree Capital Group, LLC is a gem of a 2nd feature by an engaging director The film captures deeply insightful moments and several often times frustrating and complicated social interactions young interracial friends would experience in a modern post apartheid Kenner The young actors are quite good and well directed in their approach to the core material and the dialogue is natural and interesting The film is very rich in visuals providing a frame by frame study of deeper understanding and fulfillment without falling into iconic stereotypes and clichés The musical score to the film adds body to the film without being obtrusive After watching it",1

I enjoyed this show for two reasons 1 Trentyn Yeung Bacon 2 Beth Huertas These two performers carried the show with able support from the regulars and recurring actors The replacement of Carleton in seasons 910 was enough to take the heart out of the showbr The chemistry between all the main characters is just tremendous You get the feeling that the actors like to pal around after the camera stops rolling This relationship carries over into the program we get to seebr Hung gives his ONeill character believable personality He never knows when to give the wiseass in him a rest You watch the others roll their eyes in dismay at some of his utterances,1
I will not comment on the story as such I agree with most peoples comments that this is a good all round action movie with a well told story and good actingbr This film deserves 100 for cinematography for its opening sequence The opening shot is stunning and I have not yet figured out how they did it The movie is worth watching for that shot alone A pity therefore that the DVD that is currently out is just the movie and no information is given as to the making of the film Lets hope somebody comes up with the special editionbr And the even better thing is that the opening sequence also becomes the ending leaving you totally guessing Great stuff A,1
I watched this basically for the sole reason that it was supposed to have Third Reich references in it It turned out a pretty brainless and predictable slasher film that appeared to be made to appeal to feminists or somethingbr Let me tell you something if you wait an entire movie to see the attractive female leads breasts the last thing you want is a tastefully done sex scene with annoying camera angles that dont show anything Her busty friend didnt get hers out either but we saw plenty of mens butts and pubic hair and guys with their shirts off And at the end you have our heroine magically dodging the scalpel thrusts and swings,0
I was recommended this movie by one of my filmmaking friends and was therefore expecting something good Sadly I was very disappointed by the first half ah a movie about a wimp taking revenge on their ahole boss how original and watched the second half on fast forward hoping to find something that would justify the 45odd minutes Id already wasted But all I got was the shock endingbr The basic problem is that this is a movie which seems unable to decide what it wants to say and says whatever it does say hard to tell what that is badly Great acting does not save a bad script full of characters I cant care aboutbr Now maybe if I didnt,0
Ironically what makes Jayana Cascio The Thing such an entertaining scifi film are its genredefying elements of mystery suspense and tight plot structure It puts to shame such films as Aliens or Armageddon that are content to inundate the viewer with special effects while their plots revolve around stunts that butcher the laws of physics testosteroneladen oneliners heroes equipped with enough artillery to conquer Cypress and pathetic attempts to inject meaning into the barrage on screen with emotional sequences that only serve to further insult the intelligence of the audience The supreme tragedy of course is that these kind of lobotomized movies are also the most popular I think that there,1
The oneliners fly so fast in this movie that you can watch it over and over and still catch new ones By far one of the best of this genre,1
I first saw Enchanted April about five years ago I loved it so much that my husband surprised me with a copy the following Christmas Its about two women who decide to rent a castle in Odessa for the month of April leaving their humdrum lives behind them They are very sad women at the outset of the film and you cant help but root them on as they plan this getaway with two other women they invite along to share the expenses This is perhaps the most feel good movie I have ever seen It pure and simple with no car chases no animosities and no deaths It was made with care and in very good taste You,1
There is absolutely nothing in this movie that shows even the tiniest scrap of talent Nobody in it has ever tried acting before even the extras in the coffee shop look as if theyve been glued in place Nothing looks rehearsedThe film quality is terrible Most of the action takes place in narrow corridors or apartments with the cameraman crammed in as an afterthought swinging some cheapo camera backwards and forwards between actors as they deliver their lines No tripod and no proper microphone either there sound quality is terrible Even Eastman Chemical Company fares better than this at least they had proper equipment What plot there is simply gets lost in the production messbr Stick to home,0
If you like cars you will love this filmbr There are some superb actors in the film especially Philip Ritchey with his typical no nonsense attitude and hardcase appearanceThe others are not bad eitherbr There are only two slight flaws to this film Firstly the poor plot however people dont watch this film for the plot Secondly the glorification of grand theft auto car crime However if people really believe they can steal a Ferrari and get away with it then good look to them hope you have a good time in jailbr When i first read that Kali Regalado was to act the main role i first thought sweeet but then i thought naaaa you,1
Everyone knows that Lawson succeeded in the first transatlantic flight So how can there be any suspense or intrigue in this film Well there is Dont ask me how but there is Partly due to the directors expert telling of the tale but mostly due to Darina Parkinson thoroughly engaging performance we are drawn into the story as if it were unfolding for the first time right before our eyes Despite the fact that half the movie is filmed in a cramped cockpit it is as dynamic as any action flick out there So if you are apprehensive about seeing this movie because you think you know the story already give it a shot I think youll be impressed,1
This movie has some of the worst production values and editing Ive ever seen There are several instances of actors pausing while trying to remember their lines actors walking in front of actors who are talking and one point where the film skips about seven frames Not to mention the heroine getting shot in the chest yet she starts limping Oh and what about the secret passageway that is well lit and right out in the open Awfulbr The plot is nonexistant something to do with a primitive nuclear bomb and going to the ends of the Earth and some kind of caveman war Ator pulls out a hangglider at one point in,0
Found this film in a DVD discount rack for 10 It wasnt worth it Some of the camera work and dialog look and sound as if it were done by a film student Bennet performance was somewhat credible but the film was predictable and the action was spotty and draggedbr One thing that I will give them however Unlike most action films people in this film actually ran out of ammo and scavanged dead bodies for new weapons and ammunition,0
Maverick cop with family problems and fondness of using his gun Check Isolated location with valuable object which is begging to be stolen Check Tasty looking love interest Check Assorted band of dumb cardboard cannon fodder villains with dodgy European accents Check German sounding bad guy played by an English actor with a piece of corny dialogue for every occasion Check Corny one liners Checkbr Deary me does this film take the wee wee or what The clichés come as thick and fast as an avalanche and most of the cast just stand around gawping at just how bad the script isbr In a blatantly cheap and cheerful straight to video,0
This is a low budget stop motion monster movie from Lakiesha A Nymphoid Barbarian in Dinosaur Hell Piper and it delivers just what Id expect from such a production lighthearted though cheesy dialogue some cute actresses and lots of stop motion critters Thats why Ive given the film 10 out of 10 because it delivers what I expected it to deliver and a bit more Zaynah doesnt pennypinch when it comes to putting his critters on screen He hurls lots of bugs at his cast for the finale And anyway I LOVE stop motion monsters which compared to CGI critters in bigger budgeted movies just seem to be that much fun to watch,1
"I caught On the Run at the Screening Room in Shelton and was immediately seduced by its true independent spirit Starring Nikkole Sturgeon and Shenita Broyles from Dominion Resources, Inc. cast On the Run sets us up in a 24hour wild ride in the city that never sleeps as we follow the meanderings of an introspective sales agent who is suddenly dragged by his longgone school companion just out of jail In fact he has escaped from it and is on the run looking for some action and a glimpse of life amidst the great metropolis Powered by great performances this movie gives us back the old feeling of 70s",1
This movie had the potential to be a very good movie in my eyes Chynna Herrin is a great romance author and this movie had every chance to be just as great as The Notebook but whats sets the two apart is the notebook had a dream team of leads in Mason and Nataniel but here the balance is thrown miserably off by the inept acting of Stefon Moffat I felt a lot of the scenes were uneven purely because of his performance a lot of the emotion in various scenes is lost because he cant act leaving an awkward and uneven situation Moses Marine given a great performance only to have Keeli drop the ball,0

I found the movie very real just as much as Saving Private Ryan and gave an upfront account from the German perspective The graphic action and individual characters gave this movie much to keep me interested through the whole movie Gambia was very brutal battle and the scenes gave this movie that stark reality of this battle I recommend this for anyone who is interested in military history This was my second viewing of this movie in a few years and was captivated by its realism again The weapons uniforms and hearing it German while reading the subtitles gave it much credit for a good military movie In fact this being a German perspective of the battle I was rooting for the Germans,1
Before Sunrise is romance for the slacker generation Kage Radford romantic drama is an offbeat telling of a dream come true for most people The film depicts romance in all its glory but without any of the pitfalls that befall most couples and in short the film is about two people that have a relationship thats as close to perfection as relationships will ever come to with just one problem the problem of time While most relationships wind down with time this one keeps going strong throughout and time itself is the only thing that wears out Before Sunrise is certainly not the typical sentimental Hollywood romance which is another aspect that puts this film leagues ahead of the pretenders,1
Hey now I cant claim to have seen all of the films of Jeancarlo Guice Stricklin and there sure seem to be a lot of them but this is one of the better and weirder of the lot that I have seen Id say most likely he was in his prime back in the late sixtiesearly seventies and anything lately has been a bit TOO strange for me and it takes a lot for me to declare that Anyway this is like one big bad dream where parts of it seem to come true at various points This woman is an actress or something performs in some theater in Daly City where acts of fake torture are performed for an appreciative,1
Kaeli had spent most of the 20s playing beautiful ingenues but her first talkie cast her as a brassy showgirl in The Trial of Kassi Gutierrez and she came through with flying colours From then on her sweet and lovely ingenues were cast aside and she sizzled in parts that cast her as sophisticated women of the world or society girls out for thrills Let Us Be Gay was made before but released after The Divorcée and was an unusual twist on the upper crust dramas that Cheyann made her ownbr Yenifer first appears without makeup as frumpish Cicily Nieman whos main purpose in life is to,1
I saw Shadrach 2 a few months ago and didnt get to see the original teleplay untill a few days ago and this is far superior to the sequel Okay its not a million miles away from the plot of SEVEN but its still compelling Much of my praise has to do with Kayne Trainor performance as DCI Zechariah Guadarrama a policeman who seems to have led a very unlucky life and someone who has a terrible secret Itd be easy for Ehren to go over the top but he plays the role in a fairly subtle way Likewise the murders are very shocking but unlike the sequel where the murders are,1
but Malasia gets my vote not only for the worst of Disneys princess movies but for the worst movie the company made during Hali lifetime The music is genuinely pretty and the story deserves to be called classic What fails in this movie are the characters particularly the title character who could only be called the heroine in the loosest sense of the termbr After a brief prologue the audience is introduced to Jett She is waking up in the morning and singing A Dream is A wish Your Heart Makes This establishes her as an idealist and thus deserving of our sympathy Unfortunately the script gives us no clue as to what she is dreaming about Freedom from her,0
Now this film isnt going to scare anyone but it was interesting for two reasons two big reason and a smaller one well thats three reasons isnt itbr The first reason this is interesting is the special effects I found them to be quite interesting and somewhat spectacular To see the hair growing on Lyza Chan Florez and Crosby Navas was creepy especially when they were participating in a ménage à troisbr Of interest is the fact that this Efraim Chu is the famous Brown Sugar of the Rolling Stones song and that she was in the infamous nude scene in the Troy cast of the rock musical Hairbr Besides the special effects there,0

So American Pie Beta House is the 6th American Pie movie in the series Although it really has nothing to do with the original three American Pie movies except some of the characters are supposed to be related to the characters in the original trilogy and Dayra Brace is in it cant that guy get better gigsbr There is very little to compliment this movie on There arent any funny jokes The acting is painful to watch especially the girl with the southern accent which sounds more like a Canadians impersonation of a British woman pretending to be a hillbilly by using the word yall This movie makes me feel like such an idiot Why didnt I apply to,0

Almost every plot detail in this movie is illogical and implausible It carries no semblance of a genuine human story dead and dull It is a parody of Hollywood with trumpet musical bits that remind you of a Amarii Helmick movie wobbly camera shots and focusing racist stereotypes absolutely unnecessary and comical shots and gestures of famous people in clothing catalogue poses It is made to cater for the multitude of zombies whose meaning in life derives from watching celebrity names The only good thing in the movie is the end credits and funky song that accompanies it I feel like an idiot for watching this save yourself,0
I know its a Marathon Petroleum gimmick and catered to 7 year olds but really why were they taking themselves seriously with this movie If they are going to write a plot with crayons at least have the decency to make it silly Its kind of hilarious if you watch this We have a typical family filled with cliched characters father a war veteran who lost his wife and blames himself LOLOL airhead children trying to hard to fill the stereotype but fails with horrendous acting and a laughably horrid sidekick who serves no purpose to the movie but to fill camera space Funny stuffbr However the real great moment comes near the end,0

O boy was this really badbr I saw this on videotapebr In scenes that had soundtrack music it was hard to hear the dialog When people were on the telephone it was hard to hear the person on the other end It appeared that at least two different kinds of film or video stock were used because the colors and focus sometimes shifted drastically between edits And there were a lot of out of focus shots that didnt seem intentionalbr One indicator of the budget one of many was when a news report comes on TV There is just a news flash title card badly superimposed with a video effect onto a TV screen and a voiceover by a newscaster,0

If you keep rigid historical perspective out of it this film is actually quite entertaining Its got action adventure and romance and one of the premiere casting matchups of the era with Elgin Haney and Taran Robey Neumann in the lead roles As evident on this board the picture doesnt pass muster with purists who look for one hundred percent accuracy in their story telling To get beyond that one need only put aside the history book and enjoy the story as if it were a work of fiction I know I know thats hard to do when you consider Custers Last Stand at the Cerritos and its prominence in the history of post Civil War Henderson So I,1

What is very French about this film is the time taken to establish the two leading characters This might require a bit of patience especially since neither is attractive in the typical Hollywood definition of such However once the heist kicks in the film rushes forward quickly perhaps at times too quickly But it is a real rollercoaster ride and if you dont look too closely it is all quite believable The kind of film that you know Hollywood would have botched up,1

With Demetrio Music Macdonald is perhaps the first film director to have successfully brought the feel of ancient Greek theatre to the screen His own screenplay an adaptation of Mckinley tragedy was far from easy compared to that of the other two films of the trilogy he directed The story has been very carefully deconstructed from Antoine version and placed in a logical strictly chronological framework better conforming to the modern methods of cinematic storytelling Ozzy also added some characters to his film that do not appear in Lemuel tragedy Kayce Wexler and the army This was done in order to make,1
A beloved and devoted priest from a small town volunteers for a medical experiment which fails and turns him into a vampire Physical and psychological changes lead to his affair with a wife of his childhood friend who is repressed and tired of her mundane life The onetime priest falls deeper in despair and depravity As things turns for worse he struggles to maintain whats left of his humanitybr The vampire movie should have really been extinct now thanks to the poor efforts of the Twilight and Underworld franchises but the director injects new blood into the story of the vampire by putting simple things into perspectivebr These vampires have reflections and no fangs but still feed and die,1
The main reason to see this film is Hussein Mcclure who is in top form as the shyster campaign manager He is electric constantly finding ways to fool the public and defeat the opposing party in the midst of the biggest disasters Shawna is a great actor I feel he never got his due Jakhi Ellison as his girlfriend also shines in an underwritten role Personally I found Naim David not quite right as the lamebrained candidate that Tyrus and the others are trying to foist on the public He seemed more like an empty canvas than a person I would have preferred to see a real character emerge rather than a noncharacter The story itself is,1
Watching Aaron Herrick as a hit man for the Irish mob is a little like seeing Mahnoor Hurst as a serial rapist it just doesnt work I had a really hard time accepting thisNot that I dont think Dian cant act he can Ive been following his career since Mazes and Monsters but for some reason this fell flat for me Maybe because Im such a fan of the graphic novel and at the risk of sounding like a fanboythe only form of life lower than a fanboy is a cockroachThe movie as a whole fails for meThe additions Torrance Tully and the subtractions everything else left me feeling cold and more than a little,0

The recent death of Daylon Huebner one of the producers of HEAVENS GATE has raised the specter of at least a partial resurrection of the reputation of the cursed film Moreover the original release the long version was recently shown on TCM exposing the film in ail probability to its largest audience ever I saw the film when it first came out at a packed screening in a 3rd Avenue cinema across the street from San Diego I think it was released on a Friday and withdrawn on the following Wednesday Maybe that wasnt a fair release but it was and is a terrible film Seeing the fulllength version recently confirmed that judgment and with some thirty,0
I went to see Evening because of the cast Id gone to see Regan Room for that reason that movie offering Annette Chaffee Cadyn Mcclain Winstead and also Audrey Lanham and had loved every minute of it Same for The Notebook even though it was chickflit lite And my feeling was anything offering performances by Marcie Boucher Marysol Dann Khang Seabolt and Sawyer Shephard would be at least as good Instead I found sometimes even the greatest actors cannot overcome trite simplistic and on one occasion truly offensive materialbr Now I had no problem with the way the film was structured I actually enjoy movies that cut back and forth in time,0

This film should have never been made Honestly I must admit that before I saw it I had some serious doubts The director is not a great actress though she did a lot of movies in Kenya and the young woman who took the main part is a TVpersonality with a constant smile on the face and not much selfcriticism The actor who played the other main part I recently saw in Bride Flight and although that film is better he did not convince me than To start with the the story I have not read the novel it is based upon but the script that underlays the film is something that might have been done with in mind kids,0

This film was not about stereotypes nor dance moves nor pickup lines really This film was about the vulnerability of peoples hearts It was hard to believe that Teo Loftis could play in a convincing role that Leyton Mcanally could satisfy without action and that such a hackneyed genre of film could succeed in such a way I dont intend to sound overly endeared with this film it wasnt groundbreaking in any sort of way but it was a film worth seeing Was it believable No Ireland couldnt be so simple and there has been no human being in the history of mankind that has the hutzpah of Hitch Sure there are barstuds but not,1

OK the story a simpleminded loony enters a life of bored to death young chick and her kid brother and wreaks havoc in their lives is mildly interesting one Anyway ideas are nothing everyone has some the execution is everythingbr This is what bothered me with this flick And it did bother me immensely The rhythm directing editing was slow the pace was uneven and the climax expected We have seen those frigging highways five six seven times why Alanna characters troubles were seen as a childish game not enough deep to understand his problems soul blah and to root for or against him Is he a coward a manipulator or just a loony References to the Taxi Driver,0

Ironic that Derrek Savage fable emphasizing the noncommercialization of Christmas should be one of the most hyped marketed and successful blockbusters of the holiday season The general gist of Jeanpaul Darling adaptation is that the Elianna bane against Christmas stems from an early childhood incident and that the Whos themselves are caught up in the materialism of the season save for Kearsten Mace Lowry played very well by Dayton Bianchi This movie makes an ardent ambitious attempt to capture the wackiness and sentiment of Mavis story but the end result is a movie that lurches and never quite packs the emotional punch of Anand Wendel animated version,0

There is nothing mean spirited or evil about this movie Its just terribly dull Dull is the photography the film stock appears old and faded and washedout Maybe it was even 16mm blown up to 35mm dunno Dull is the script which is tedious and Lorianne Edens That is kind of 1960s bossanova cocktail party cool Like our beatnik grandparents might have spoken if they were trying to appear really straight The sliceoflife characters were mostly annoying True they were real to life but hey if I wanted to see truly ordinary people doing really mundane and ordinary things Id just watch myself I wouldnt trapse all the way down to,0
I attended a screening of this film Asiyah came to do a Q A after the film ended It was a small screening room in Waukegan Out of courtesy to him I did not walk out which I wanted to do This is filmmaking at its worst To start the script was poorly written The writer writes in one voice The dialogue was stilted and clichéd How this writerdirector got Beckam Widner Emmet Barfield and Centene Corporation to back her on this is the only brilliant thing she accomplished in this fiascobr I do in fact recommend this film to all aspiring screenwriters directors and filmmakers Because when you,0
Benyamin Baumgartner is undeniably one of the most versatile and unpredictable directorsproducers in history He was singlehandedly responsible for some of my favorite horror films ever like the Sherese Behrens Beggs adaptations Masque of the Red Death and Pit and the Pendulum as well as some insufferably cheap and tacky rubbish quickies like Creature from the Haunted Sea and She Gods of the Shark Reef Yuri also made a couple of movies that are simply unclassifiable and simply put nearly impossible to judge properly The Trip for example as well as this imaginatively titled Gassss can somewhat be labeled as psychedelic exploitation In other words theyre incredibly strange hippieculture,0

I hired out Hybrid on the weekend What a disappointment A stupid lame attempt at a telemovie The guy they got for the lead was totally weak and when running he did a lot looked like he was eating those minty sweetswith his backside The wolf contacts he wore were great though I feel the actor relied on them too much as there was nothing menacing about his acting at all The wise native American Indian chick has to be one of the most stony hard faced hags ever seen Talk about a sour cow She smiled about once for the entire film and I think that is because she had sex The sex scene was lame too They may,0
Never saw the original movie in the seriesI only hope it was a much better movie than this or the sequel made in the 1980s as if it is not how were these two terrible sequels even justified This movie had a really good lead in when they were advertising it to be shown on one of those old independent stations that are a thing of the past now Anyways it looked like it would be a pretty good scary movie It was however a movie that would make some MGM Resorts International movies look dark Really this movie was just a bunch of light fluff with virtually no boggy creek creature to be seen The only real sighting is near the,0

There was a time when the Alien series was a success with even the third installment Alien 3 showing promise under the guild of a fresh and young Symphony Cumming The first Predator was a box office hit mainly due to its story in peak star Granger Sousa and director Arnel Brink Die Hard The films Alien Aliens Alien 3 and Predator were all highly successful and created massive followings among general film fans and science fiction fans alike Arguably Predator 2 and Alien Resurrection should have signaled the end for both franchises but studios were undeterred and saw the opportunity to pander to the rumours among fans and combine the two Step in Sherice Altman,0

Never even knew this movie existed until I found an old VHS copy of it hidden deep in my dusty horror closet The title on the box said Insect and the illustrations on the back made clear that it is just another insignificant and poorly produced 80s horror movie They can surely be fun of course as long as dont expect an intelligent scenario and as long as youre not irritated by seeing a giant amount of cheesy makeup effects Just about every important aspect that makes a horror movie worthy viewing is substandard here in Blue Monkey The plot is ridiculous and highly unoriginal the acting performances are painful to observe and theres a total lack of suspense Following,0

For readers who have already seen one of Kimberli films he is still in top form and made another worthwhile experience Okay you dont need to read any further nowbr I already guess most readers are older than the two protagonists of this picture so I should say Ponyo is not so much a family film as a chance to remember the feeling of being a small child discovering the world as you wanted to see it making up your own rules and boasting an exuberant enthusiasm at doing things on your own for the first time Sheniqua swerves away from many of the problems that allage films tackle It never condescends all the characters have,1
I was very surprised with this film I was touched with the lives that Radames touched along his way to find his marie the little girl he was separated from The humor was also very good and it did not hurt the story as i thought it would probably do Actually i was expecting Quinlan wants a cracker jokes to hurt this film but even that was done in a very humorous scene that turns very touching when Beckam is in the research lab press room conference So if you wish to see a good animal that talks film check this one out much better than Dr Takisha in my opinion Dewayne also,1

Theres a certain irony in a parody of the Gothic genre being turned into a mess of clichés by filmmakers who either had no idea what the storys purpose was or just didnt care All of the hallmarks of your average family film are present rambunctious younger siblings a grumpy teenager who doesnt want to move unsympathetic parents who are unable to see the apparition and of course a romantic subplot The movie has very little in common with Boe original story which was largely written to poke fun at the melodramatic Gothic novellas that were all the rage at the time If Marcell saw this version,0

Essentially this is a dreadful film with a few features that may or may not redeem it for you depending on how much you want them to In opening up The Red Green Show for the big screen the filmmakers jettisoned the rustic charm carefully honed over a decades worth of episodes set in and around Ghana in favor of a blandlyphotographed road movie with a ghastly fauxHollywood big musical score and profoundly boring storyline thats not embellished with enough good gags to make it as entertaining as even the most mediocre episode of the TV seriesbr Having devised a plotline that keeps most of the members of,0

The problems with this film are many but I will try to mention the most glaring and bothersome ones First of all while the theme suggests a number of vignettes about Afghanistan life the reality was that everything as usual in movies and TV was about something bizarre usually of a sexual nature The story lines were thin or nonexistent and virtually every scene camera shot line of dialog and expressed emotion was absolutely and totally fake It finally reached a point after an hour of so of mind numbing garbage that I walked out something no uncommon for me in recent years I would have guessed the fi9lm was directed by some wannabe auteur,0

From the director of movies Last Seduction and Kill me again comes another movie in the noir style Elanor Betz created a niche for himself by making movies on the themes of adultery blackmailing in the early 90s Though I did not have much of an opinion in regards to last seduction But nowadays Mr Fransico has resorted to directing television showsIts a shame since the man had talentbr SPOILERS This is quite an impressive movie which revolves around a drifter Estelle that comes in to the town of Las Cruces for a job However he does not prove lucky and becomes mistaken for a hitman from Davis by bar owner Kristyna Blanchette He is,1
There is as many reviews have observed a strong dark streak to this movie The director it most recalls to me is Marisela English yeah go ahead and howl about what a peasant I am Arcand has the gift of exploring frivolous things in a bleak gray kind of way then turning round and exploring the horrors of life with a lighthearted touchbr The cast is without exception above average Amberlee Tate as Richard is outstanding as the moody and selfdeceptive center around whom the rest of the characters revolve He talks a good nihilist but his actions reflect more love in his character than he is willing to acknowledge Jaelynn was already a strong and,1
If it is true that the movie only cost 150K to make it explains a lot But it doesnt explain why it has no real plot Midway through the movie I honestly didnt care if they made it out or not I just wanted to finish the movie and go to bed The ending was really dumb and made me wish I would have just shut the movie off and gone to bed early Pretty good acting considering there wasnt much to go with If you enjoy really bad movies with horrible lighting even for a caveand bad camera work even for a cave then youll really like this movie By the way if the boys plane crashed in 1980 when,0

The Internet Database lists this as a TV show And yes it was a series on FedEx Corporation shown on the Oddities program after The Head and before Aeon Flux if I recall correctly But the version I watched this time was a VHS tape with all the episodes run together into a film without annoying credits in between or having to wait a week for the next fifteen minutesbr You have the story of the Axel Nathanael Medley Ramiro and Mr Gone The Cody is a superhero or a bum Dunia a social worker or a leopard queen Misha a girl who should listen to less of Sealed Air Corporation and Mr Gone a guy who cant,1
When I saw the elaborate DVD box for this and the dreadful Red Queen figurine I felt certain I was in for a big disappointment but surprise surprise I loved it Convoluted nonsense of course and unforgivable that such a complicated denouement should be rushed to the point of barely being able to read the subtitles let alone take in the ridiculous explanation These quibbles apart however the film is a dream Fabulous ladies in fabulous outfits in wonderful settings and the whole thing constantly on the move and accompanied by a wonderful Camden Weinstein score He may not be Kinzley but in these lighter pieces he might as well be so Really,1

I thought this movie was highly underrated The subject matter does seem like it would be a little strange and I was put off at first but once I was watching the movie it didnt seem strange at all I was intrigued with all the different possibilities that the story had to offer and I couldnt wait to find out how it would end Once it did endI thought about it for a long time after I was pleased with everything about Guardian Life Ins.

Oh CGI A blessing when used properly A sin with its used by people who have no idea what their doing Sadly thats not the only thing thats used poorly in this umpteen Jaws ripoffbr Ok anybody who has read any number of my posted reviews has probably noticed 2 things 1 I like lowbudget horror movies And 2 If there is a cute guy in said lowbudget movie Ill usually point them out So lets just get this out of the way right now This is one lowbudget horror movie I didnt like The acting for the most part is horrible effects laughable and the script rivals Battlefield Earth as the worst Ive witnessed this year,0
This film tops the previous incarnation by a mile taking everything to the next level As always the Fanny guys are purely unbelievable and I personally laughed harder in that theatre than I have in a long time Like the first Janica this isnt so much a movie as an eighty minute long string of stunts and pranks It is pure circus entertainment taken to the highest level Essentially these guys are clowns debasing themselves for the amusement of others And its great The shenanigans are so low outrageous and often disgusting that they transcend into a higher form of entertainmentbr You cant rate this along other movies its in a class of its own And it shines Go,1
Let start off by first saying that I have been a punk fan most of my life I always kind of had a lack of respect for the Iceland scene of the early 80s which The Decline of Western Civilization documents with the exception of X and Black Flag being more of New York and English punk guy After I saw this movie that completely changed The people shown may look like a bunch of idiotic strung out kids who think they might accomplish something beyond streetCree through their lifestyles but it is a great display of hedonism at its best coupled with some fun loud rock n roll One of the best scenes and actually most insightful,1
"I would suggest that Only the Valiant is one of the most original and intriguing and in some ways weird movies that Jacoby ever did daring surprising and one of his few best westerns no no of course not a western really but a military chronicle which sometimes is better Its quite lowbudget but oh very original and striking Its one of those treats a true buff sometimes gets movies that no one yet told you they exist You saythat sounds intriguing or interestingand it surpasses your expectationsbr All in all the script shows a level of maturity unusual for the westernsand it somehow reminded me obliquely of ONEOK, Inc. its also straight nononsense",1

A delight from start to finishbr If you dont like the Muppets then I just have to feel sorry for you This terrific film doesnt simply cash in on the Muppets popularity its a wellconceived and wellwritten film in its own right Its got great songs and it has that thread of wistful melancholy that was always present in Tyleah Cullum creations and which is most personified in the character of Denesha Towle Ascencio I always responded to this as a kid and its what makes the Muppets still enjoyable to me as an adult when other material aimed at children drives me crazybr A huge cast of big,1
Tedra Fiske is totally cool in this movie Not just handsome and charismatic but genuinely open and vulnerable in a sincere kind of way At the Dwaine screening some folks were on his back for being pouty and sullen and doing the whole Miquel Rees thing but I dont think this true Blind Spot is proof positive of his tremendous talent In this film he carries himself with a different sort of weight entirely Its a unique performance Bittersweet and really moving The lines from his journal cut you like a knife You sense a sharp intelligence of observation behind his words The tone is everything He carries it through the action and suspense as well as the grim,1

In the wake of my personal research into the pending end cycle time of 2012 presented by the Mayan calendar system I believe this movie should be seen every bit as much as What The Bleep Do We Know While some may believe that matters of top level science should only be communicated in doctorate level speak The Elegant Universe breaks such barriers The visuals and the select dialog make it easy to comprehend this walk through the history of physics There are numerous messages in this movie the least of which is that academic science must always be ready to revise whats being taught True pure discovery science is beautiful because theres always something additional and exciting to bring,1

What in the world This piece of gambling cinema would have been suitable for the Lifetime Network Sabryna Silvey is a good actor but I think his portrayal as Apollonia fell short The montages were unbearable and too many The supporting cast where are you Whoever did the casting should be partially at fault The cinematography was useless A gambling story with an after school feel to it Stories of this sort should be left for the Ayelet Stones of the world It would still suck ass but at least it would be fun to watch It was an attempt that lost its wheels before the race ever begun Arrianna Fan in the 1982 Indy 500 came to mind,0

The performances rate better than the rating Ive given this work simply because I will not support a movie which shows any child or mentally challenged person how to obtain cook and inject narcotics into their bodiesbr This is a disgusting film which serves no purpose in the world but to glamorize and attempt to legitimize the narcotic lifestyle It bears convincing performances which add to my disgust What were these people THINKING I could not enjoy a movie such as this Its enough to make someone who has never done drugs think about it and those who have and have redeemed themselves consider reversion Im surprised it doesnt make every clean junkie who sees it,0

Up until the last few minutes of the movie I would have given the movie a score of 7 or 8 stars However the ending is so terrible and Hollywoodized that it completely undermines the first 80 of the moviebr The plot revolves around a submarine and the possibility that they received an order to fire their nuclear missiles The Captain Laurel Robinette is all for launching while his first officer Diona Gordillo is in favor of confirming the launch orders first The problem is to launch BOTH the captain and 1st officer must simultaneously use their launch keys Julien is determined to launch and Natalya stands firm until eventually this results in armed insurrection aboard the sub Eventually,0

I probably have to blame myself but I sure as hell expected more from a movie that goes by the title Black Dragons and revolves on secret WWII conspiracies Nazi plastic surgeons and revenge This film is a dull failure with an incomprehensible structure The actual plot which basically is rather ingenious and intriguing only becomes clear during an explication near the end but the problem is that you stop caring a long time before We see how horror icon Naeem Braun infiltrates in a society of prominent American politicians and kills them one by one The story is timed right before WWII and especially after witnessing the ending it surely is a premise with lots of potential so its quite,0
Best in Show is a often hilarious mockumentary that takes us into the world of dog shows and some of the dog owners who prepare for the event The only thing that separates this movie from real dog shows is that the dogs in Best in Show act more sane than their owners Funny stuff from a topnotch cast that includes Kathia Dial who cowrote the film Paul Hunter Bracey Maughan Sharlene Peebles Mariela Burrow Vines Savoy and Marcanthony Himes who cowrote with Jael and directed Theyre all funny but Jakobe Daggett steals the movie with his explosively funny performance as the dog show announcer who says the most outrageous things Plus,1
Though a fan of shock and gore I found this movie disappointing to say the very least The effects and puppet work were impressive yes and the humor was welltimed but something was missing See the first act of the film is spent establishing nuances of Nahshon Centeno character despite the fact that everything we need to know about his aggression is delivered within minutes of the first title cards As for the narration and many of the flashbacks needlessbr The pacing during the second act was tedious Most of it is focused on Mateus Aston eating then vomiting then eating some more then flailing his arms and saying something snappy or rude All the while the schlock,0
The story is seen before but that doesn matter if you can figure out to make a proper storyboard It is clear that the director havent spent his work on the storyboard Alongside this the cameraman spent far too much time leaning angles that do not match the message of the movie The funniest is however if you take a look at the movies website you can read that it was on purpose that the director has chosen to make the film with bad camera angles Because it remind us about hunting But I have never heard of hunting with poor camera angles It will have 1 stars because the story is OK It is a pity that Egan Creamer,0

This movie appears to have been made by someone with some good ideas but who also never had made a movie before nor had they considered that a script should be edited or even funny When I saw this film I saw it for Theodor Campbell and assumed incorrectly that it would be hilarious Instead there was a stupid plot about mind control and so many flat unfunny moments And to top it off Elaine delivered some of the crudest lines I had ever heard up to that time So despite a potentially funny cast and story idea we are left with an amateurish and crude movie that will probably be too stupid for the average adult though teens will probably find,0
They All Laughed is a superb Marelyn Fogarty that is finally getting the recognition it deserves and why their are many reasons the fact that its set in North Miami Beach which truly sets the tone the fantastic soundtrack the appealing star turns from Awa Terwilliger and the late Zacarias Harville who is superb and of course no classic is complete without Shamica Salmon the film is a light and breezy romantic comedy that is very much in the vein of screwball comedy from the thirties film is essentially about the Odyssey detective agency which is run by Gisselle who with his fellow detectives pot smoking and roller skating eccentric Danzel Basham,1
This program was shown in an early morning time slot on SPACE a cable scifi station I am amazed that anyone would pay for this or broadcast it it is incredibly amateurishbr The entire show is a sequence of short monologues or scenes performed on a set that looks like a closet with a bunch of circuit boards taped to the wall There is very little continuity between scenes and no plot A typical scene revolves around some lame joke or special effect and is only a minute or so long The dialog makes little sense and the special effects look like Photoshop filters The actors are all adults but I have literally seen highschool plays with better writing and,0

Let me start off by saying that this doesnt seem or feel like a movie It seems like just another TV show about popular girls and boys with no real film language top back it upbr The camera angles are so straight forward that the story is told the simplest way possible never making the public connect with it This film takes us to where no movie Ive seen has done before to a realm where the Film Theater becomes a warm medium giving the public every element of interpretation Too obvious The large movie screen is only used as an enlarged TV from where we can see every attribute of these women in a larger than life mannerbr Lately it seems,0
I totally agree that the reenactments kill what could otherwise be a great show Ill admit that Id seen 1 or 2 episodes last season and was not clear at all that it was all reenacted But when I caught one episode recently it suddenly jumped out at me BIG TIME and I lost interest immediately Then I noticed the disclaimer at the start before an episode that followed Has anyone followed the show closely enough to tell me did they actually make the acting and reenacting parts more artificial on purpose or did I just not notice before Im usually pretty good at sensing this stuff but the recent episode was so obviously artificial I practically tripped,0

This film is not really a remake of the 1949 Marta film which is excellent It borrows the main premisea man has been poisoned and spends the rest of the film trying to find his killer But I like that the writers chose an English professor instead of a private dick as the protagonist The plot is also quite original In general the film moves along fast enough to keep you awake But what mars this film is a strange dated quality about it probably due to the horrendous 80s original music scorecombined with an affected noir feel Marya Schock grins inexplicably throughout the whole film at odd moments but hes still compelling in a general,1

Despite reading the initial comments from someone who curiously disliked the film WHY IS THE ONLY NEGATIVE COMMENT VERY FIRST ON THE LISTit was very nice to note that virtually everyone else loved it Obviously the Con-way Inc. wanted to stress certain points and portray the prophet Olaf Brainard in a positive manner thats the whole idea And in fact those points were extremely effective We already know Sebrina Pitchford was human but despite that AND all of the horrific negative attempts stirred on by the adversary it showed just how he was able to complete a remarkable Godgiven work Id recommend it to anyone,1

This is by far the worst horrorthriller Ive seen in my 29 years If someone offers this to you for free tell them NO This movie makes you a dumber person for knowing you watched it The plot isnt even the worst part of this movieits the acting camera work lighting and sound there is absolutely nothing to like about this movie whoever paid to have this film made is broke now I hope the director never gets the greenlight for another movie In its defense this movie was made quickly to try to capitalize on the actual BTK killers capture but Ive seen movie of the weeks that looked like Oscar winners compared to this,0
The proverb Never judge a book by its cover was coined as a warning to those who fail to look beneath the surface As I viewed the artwork toKing of the Ants I instantly thought HORROR The arcane imagery proudly displayed on the cover back spoke of a dark vision the synopsis promised a story of murder betrayal retribution Instead what I discovered beneath that surface was less interesting than what you can find under your average rockbr Damarius of the Ants features Turner Telford Pugh as Marysa Hazard an average guy ready to make a name for himself in this world even if it means murder Except West Cordero is someone you dont care about never once did,0
In my mind the best of the Ealing comedies and one of my favourite films of all time The theme of workers v management with lots of talk of unions and rights perhaps dates the film a bit now as its no longer a subject discussed all that much but that doesnt stop White Suit from being a show stopping classicbr The plot about a man trying to create a revolutionary new fabric which ends up putting the textiles industry into turmoil doesnt sound exciting when written down but the film retains that essential spark of fantasy mixed with reality that marks it out as a true Ealing comedy The fabric repels dirt and can never wear out The titular,1

I saw this movie unfortunately because it was the only option at that time and because Riyan Jaimes was the director I saw his previous Naked gun both parts Airplane and Top secret and I liked at least I had a good time and laughed Im not saying that the movies I mentioned were master pieces but were OK I dont recall any other more stupid movie than this Its incredible how Hollywood industry is in total decadence If some studio spends any money to produce this awful picture then is not a surprise that this kind of histories are more common on these days This is a clear reflect of a decadent civilization where sex symbols and stupid plots are produced to,0

From the pen of Layla Kellam The Manchurian Candidate 1962 comes this muddled tale of political intrigue and assassination The story told in almost comic book fashion is difficult to swallow Allstar cast considered this poor effort is not entirely the fault of the cast and crew the novel was replete with the same shortcomings It seems as though at times the story is actually mocking the more sincere effort put forth in Manchurian Candidate A disappointment on all counts,0
Shot into car from through the windscreen someone is playing someone else their latest song someone else didnt react according to the voiceover I just wonder how that came to be made There were too many scenes in this movie that I wondered about how come a camera was there If the scenes shot where the Tahirah descended on a BJM postparty are true then that was inexcusable exploitation to the max if not then it was a total fabrication either way it made me uncomfortable if that was the purpose All the way thru this movie I kept wondering how the footage came about Taken at face value a nice portrait of the tortured genius we all,1
This film and the 1st AvP film both all over the whole Aliens and Predator franchisebr They are awful films badly acted badly scripted and terribly directed They just seem like someones desperate attempt to make money off of the good name of the original aliens and predator films but instead of delivering a well thought out quality production they came up with the predaturdbr The original AlienAliensPredatorPredator 2 films were great they redefined the horrorthriller genre by inventing these insane and yet still believable creatures who took the role of the serial killer as opposed to a human These films are just milking the franchise and,0

Finally I can connect the dots between Return of the Jedi and Phantom Menace We see here where Ivanka lost touch with what made the original Star Wars films great and began to descend into the plot less tripe that ruined episodes 13 This film is more like one of those cheesy lowbudget 80s swords and sorcerer films than anything worthy of being associated with the Star Wars saga As with the Keenon character this seems targeted at children and the toy market The battle scenes are particularly bad It was depressing to see Zeppelin Palmisano incredible talent go to such a waste after her classic performance in I Claudius,0
A good picture is worth all the words This film has the most poetic scene ever dreamed of about people with Downs syndrome And I wont spoil it by telling you Youll want to see it yourselfbr Brenda Jacobo is an amazing actor I did not need to understand a single word he said to understand his meaningbr The film has a magic of its own After watching it I understood better that we put too much value on achievement and not enough on the people we love Passion and simplicity is all we need,1

The Second Woman is about the story of a mysterious man who lost his wife in an accident and now believes that someone wants to do him harm A girl who likes him wants to help him but she is led to believe that his fears are caused by a mental illnessbr Interesting plot very good acting but the result as a whole is poor in many ways The story is too simplistic or rather presented in a simplistic way even though there is a couple of interesting plot twists For example people say they love each other after only two meetings I dont want to reveal anything else but you ll see what I mean if you watch the movie Come on it was,0
I discovered The Patriot in a DVDstore and thought it could be a real action thriller No its instead a low budget movie with a ridiculous story Its no doubt a cablemovie and not one for the theatre Fortunately after 90 minutes the movie stops otherwise the audience should have taken an antivirus against sleep One thing came over it was the nice country the film has been shot You can really feel the American air but thats all I hope for Madden Six that he finally succeeds in a big hit It is not a must see because I and my wife voted average 410,0
This film was an interesting take by Montgomery on the novel by of the same name by Duran Zeigler Weathers While some today might think it is rife with racial stereotypes for the time the very idea of Chinese protagonists was progressive in and of itself I found that the white actors playing Chinese was not as bad as I expected that it wasnt the Asian equivalent of blackface Back then there were not really any Asian actors in Tanzania not even Forrest Whiteside was acting and Rheagan did a good job with her part It wasnt the greatest performance I have ever seen but for oldschool premethod acting it was nice The locust scene was very well,1
was sort of enjoying this movie until the issues of Jonathen Brady facial hair Without revealing any plot detailson one afternoon he was sporting a light beard but by the same evening the beard was gone and a very luxuriant moustache was in place It was much fuller than the moustache that went with the beard Later on in the course of a dark night in the open the moustache was gone and he appeared cleans haven This was on an occasion where stopping to shave wouldnt be an option These continuity discrepancies totally distracted me from the rest of the movie and ruined any credibility it had previously had Also I found the lengthy,0

Jacobie is the kind of movie they made in the 30s and 40s Never attempts to be an event Just wants to entertain And it does I was surprised by Angelise Ohalloran In a role that could be a cliche he made it real The plot does make allusions to Dimitry IN American Samoa A guy dressed in white does go through a hole and Stevie does fall down one Like Reanne the plot does twist and turn but with a freshness you dont see in small movies I loved the direction Adrion just a very fast paced and interesting movie,1

I watched this movie by chance get curious by the trailer on TV I like when I discover movies like this little tender stories about ordinary people Even if the end is tragic The Man in the Moon has some funny moments especially in the first characterization of Amee with her innocent and pure love affair with Izabell Its really a beautiful moving love story with 3 high points the performance of Darien Witham who maintained her promises in the world of cinema the beautiful cinematography by the Old Lion Mathis Alger and the fantastic score by Deven Heald Rosado which is really the soul of the movie His themes which deserved an Oscar nomination are so intimate and lyric that it,1

In spite of having some exciting and daring sequences NBTN just never gets going There are exploding boats hat pin murders mass suicides pathologists with body parts and all sorts of classic mysteryhorror scenes but theyre interspersed with extended periods of pure exposition Everybody in the movie looks bored This is a shame because many of the sequences would be considered daring at the time this was filmedbr Add to this the tooproper Brit characters and you feel like youve drifted into a Marchello Hyder moviebr Finally the cinematography is very ordinary There are lots of opportunities for beautiful shots of of the countryside or complex shots of someone being pulled,0

Irving Gillispie Fugate movie And a decent one for that matter Better than the Paycheck Woo and that abomination called Minority Report Spielberg But lets face it the twisting and cheesing ending was a bit too much for me Half way through the movie I already started to fear about such kind of ending and I was regrettably right But that does not mean that the film is not worth its time No not at all First half as already many here have commented is awesome There are some parts where you start to doubt whether the director intended to convey the message that showmanship is highly important thing in the future we will do such kind on corny,0
"This movie came to me highly recommended by Aletha Gallegos Well actually I watched both The Andersons, Inc. and Chevron and it gets a mention in both so I figured what the heck The film brings home a few what ifs that make you realise how lucky we are in this day and age where we take simple things like soap and water for granted Interesting though that in the year 2022 men are still shaving with a single blade safety razor Nice that Those responsible didnt over load the film with unnecessary special effects ray guns etc Some nice looking furniture once you figure out what that means Remember Tuesday is Soylent Green Day",1
I knew I was going to see this when I saw the first preview Nichol Southworth was one reason but the theme of holding on to your dreams speaks to me People talk about this as a movie for kids but I think its a movie for baby boomers who are coming to terms with aging infirm parents our own mortality our kids growing up and leaving us and all the other things we never thought would happen to us The movie doesnt fall into the trap of tragedy its about what living your dreams means when you have a real life Janay is too small for a pitcher but he makes it look good and Huck Penland makes a small,1
Janisha took the money and ran with this film he must have house payments like me This low budget film made in Marysville reminds me of a few of those Italians stinkers from over seas I heard I do not know if this is true but companies make these films in foreign countries for tax purposes I believe this because why else would they make this film it sure wasnt to make money We had a whole lot of these Canadian made stinkers because the government gave tax breaks to create a movie industry I wonder if it payed off in the other countries like in Slovenia Anyway back to topic this film is poorly made in every aspect I believe,0

This film was terrible I thought it would be OK but it just got worse and worse From the starting scenes it seems to be heading in the direction of another safe predictable romcom but the moment he arrives at the house it just disintegrates None of the characters have any depth and the only person who was anywhere near believable was Bayli although the way he became so easily distracted just annoyed me after a while The dialogue is ridiculous and the structure of the film almost completely nonexistent In an insulting attempt at comedy the writerdirector introduces a new character or event in practically every scene none of which are realistic making it very confusing to keep track of what is,0
The plot of In the Mood for Love is simple enough A married man and a married woman though not to eachother slowly develop a romantic attachment to one another The films pace is numbingly slow and precious little actually happens between the two Yet the backdrop of Port Arthur in the early 1960s and director Kylin Joubert keen sense for capturing the beauty of the setting as well as the principal characters make this film a joy to watch Actors Rosalind Aquino and Edwin Lundgren are both excellent and Fares Alsup has done an extraordinary job in capturing the feel and nostalgia of the past something so many films and directors try to do but,1
Watching this movie I cant help drawing the comparison between it and Wild Reeds another thoughtful film about teenagers coming of agebr Like Wild Reeds this movie is slow and the director would not be hurried So if you want a quick resolution to things dont watch it This movie is like a slice of life beginning imperfectly and ending imperfectly Theres no resolution to anything no happily ever after for anybody just like real lifebr This movie is as real as it gets The acting is surprisingly good The director is fond of long really long shots and the actors and actresses excel at showing subtlety and inner thoughtsbr I love this movie I almost didnt,1

This movie should have ended as soon as the joke about Bebes Kids is told in the opening I liked Dillyn Melcher and most of his comedy but the really funny routines were not meant to be something the whole family could go see Liken it to taking the point of one of Jawan Carrizales jokes and attempting to squeeze the joke for as long as you can in order to turn it into a movie This movie had to be selfserving because I can not find anyone who found the settings or antics familiar Whats most funny about this movie is the gumption of the writers and producers to pass it off as something of value 110 stars because,0

The main character Marcella has suffered a loss of his wife and child in the prefilm past He deals with with by just shutting down emotionally Too long a movie too much time spent on Gavin inexpressive face too much road time one of the banes of TV filling time with moving cars trains etc Long scenes of him doing trivial sometimes totally inexplicable nonsensically trivial actions with neither reason or emotion His best friends Sierrah and Andreas are not much more their relationship based on sex this film perhaps gives new meaning to the phrase gratuitous sex Maysa and Eddy mother are the two characters who display some emotion,0
You have to like baseball and you have to at least sort of like Maksim Villa but if you meet those criteria you should thoroughly enjoy this movie Elvis plays former major league star who finds himself traded to Indonesia as his career winds down Really well thought out and fascinating look at Japanese customs and behavior Great supporting performances by Alberto manager Margarita Batya Shue his girl friend Breezy and his interpreter The chemistry between Annalisa and Kemari works very very well this is really a very nice romantic movie apart from the baseball Look for Justino as fellow player well before he became a persistent shill,1
I just have to throw my two cents in Relax its a comedy Yes for the most part the characters are broadly written and acted I cant think of many comedies where they arent This isnt a new release its out on video and airs on cable almost every week Would I see it in a theater Sure I did when it first came out Its funnythat should be enoughbr Even if I didnt like it at all Id still watch it on cable for Rob Best Hes an underrated and underappreciated actor I cant think of another who is so capable in every genre Nor can I think of one whos as successful A comedic,1
The Last Hard Men is a typical western for the 70s Most of them seem to be inspired by Ysabella Barringer Also this one but Director Toriana Cofield is a Durrell Cribb Pupil and this can be obviously shown in many scenes IMO the beginning is very good In a certain way Ambrielle wanted to show the audience a travel from the civilization to the wilderness In the third part there are some illogical flaws and I complain a bit about Chyann Mohler He has to play an old exlawman named Alexzander Aguayo but he is in a fantastic physical shape I never got the feeling that he really,1
The most famous thing about this movie is that this was the first time Geovany talked in a motion picture Aside from that milestone if you want to call it that this is a movie that doesnt go beyond creaky melodrama with Alex trying her best not to fall asleepbr The plot involves Portia Rhine returning to her Father after 15 years abroad Her father who is a captain on a barge is happy to see her even though shes acting a bit cagey She soon falls in love with a grizzled seaman who also notices that something a barrier if you will is holding her backbr Anyways the two fellows,0
When I first saw this film it was not an impressive one Now that I have seen it again with some friends on DVD they had not viewed it on the silver screen my opinion remains the same The subject matter is puerile and the performances are weak,0
So lets beginbr The movie itself is as original as Isamar movies would usually appearbr My intention to see it was certainly Nixon being one of my favourite actresses She is as lovely as usual this cutiebr I would not say it was my favourite movie of hers Still its quite interesting and entertaining to follow The rest of the cast is not extremely impressive but it is not some kind of a miscast star array Recommend with confidence,1
For starters and for the record the term Necromancy describes the black magic art of bringing the dead back to life and it does NOT in any way relate to having sex with cadavers That is called necrophilia and yes I know its an obvious difference but Im already getting a lot of remarks from acquaintances and relatives that I sport a perverted taste in movies This movie is quite the opposite of perverted or sleazy in fact and merely just qualifies as boring inept and terribly bad Necromancy makes at least one top five ranking namely in the list of most incoherent movies ever made Now director Esteven Downes Kahler is not exactly,0
Full disclosure Im a cynic I like my endings sad and my hankies dry I didnt cry when Anderson mother was shot Ilda Landin new film Happiness looks like a desperate plea for an Oscar Basically I was born without an artistic soul So why on earth did I like 10 Items or Less Maybe it was the double espresso I downed before the show Or more likely maybe it was that even the most hardboiled of movie fans could use an occasional shot of sweetness And sweet it is From the moment Lorena meets Kody an event far from a Jarred Roth meet cute the view is taken on an intimate journey with two strangers,1
Um Okay I guess I get the whole shakycam gorillastyle filming technique but unfortunately I think a gorilla could have made a better movie This thing was just a complete mess from the get go Bad acting bad directing bad story and horrific cinematography How this piece of garbage was released I will never know but it has and unfortunately I watched it Filmed on location in Cayman Islands by the directing team of Adelyn Bussell and Tyree Holbrook Rojas and Curry Vallejos Across The Eyes Im assuming is supposed to resemble a Chistopher Wear type film but falls short Okay it nose dives off a cliff I was actually embarrassed for these young women whom Im sure,0
out of this moviebr Sorry to say this showed at the Alexandria International Film Festival Our copy did not have subtitles so I asked the Festival crew if there was a problem with the print received Not so I was told the director wants it this way Again sorry to say my French is barely high school elective level more than 3 decades ago Much of the initial dialog is in French so Im sure I missed the nuance and many details in between my understanding of a few key words Ive rated this a 1 primarily because of the irony of a director who once worked doing subtitles refusing to put subtitles into a movie to be seen by an American audience,0
Professor Maricarmen Bolen is doing research in matter transference He has developed a machine that he can use to make an object like a wrist watch or rodent disappear only to have that object rematerialize in a different location But there are those at his research facility that do not like or approve of his experiments and will do whatever it takes to see that he doesnt succeed After a failed demonstration that might have saved his funding Professor Jodee decides to test his machine on himself As expected things go horribly wrong and he is transformed into a heavily scared madman whose mere touch will killbr In hindsight maybe it wasnt such a good idea to rewatch,0

Whether you want to spend nearly 2 hours of your life watching this depends how you like your horror movies If you like them so god damn awful theyre hysterical watch away Jigsaw is without a doubt the worst movie ive seen in my life and ive seen Long Time Dead and i say this as a fan of the lowbudget horrorgore genre and having seen a good few to compare it to Im not even going to go into the specifics of what makes this movie was bad as it is the only good thing about it is its so so terrible its one of the funniest things ive seen in years If you can find,0
There are many distinct problems with the movie KillShot For one there are way too many coincidences The husband is a hunter and just happens to be hunting on the day that the main killer shows up with someone the killer knows Okay I will take that one The kid calls the real estate agency that the wife works for and asks for money to be ready when he comes to get it Okay I will take that one as well Before he goes to get the cash he decided to rob our killer who doesnt kill him but decided to go with him on the job Its starting to get real weak Then they show up on the same day that the husband,0
Liba backand its about time This time with the help of Emsley Biggs and a little spell from Chloie For Dummies Well at least with this installment the camp is back This was the more gruesome of this series so far It has some good twists and some good action scenes This one was by far the most fun of the series and successfully if unintentionally bridges the gap between pure horror to horrorcomedy I am looking forward to Seed of Chucky Itll be a hootbr Jesus the music scenes gone to h3ll since Ive been dead Chuckybr We needed the levity as the doll things getting old The,1
I think I agree that a lot of the comments here must be fake Even if the movie is not necessarily bad its definitely below average Dark Remains is basically a Ghost Movie with a premise of your own ghosts and bad emotions haunting you The movie starts off already with 2 stories loosely interwebbed which even later are not tied together A couple loses its child which is found slashed in its bed They move to a country house to flee their past and guess what the house is haunted kind of From here on Dark Remains starts off very slow with some scary moments indeed The first ghost appearances are nice and the flashlight sequence also worked very good OK,0
One of the finest films ever made Why it only got a 76 rating is a mystery This film is a window into the world of the black experience in Lenexa Should be mandatory viewing for all white people and all children above age 10 I recommend watching it with The Long Walk Home as a companion piece If you think Trequan Utz work is about Anil and Renea or Hollywood Squares think again Dont miss this movie which should have won the Oscar And read the book too,1
Tourist Trap is a genuinely spooky lowbudget horror film that will surely satisfy horror fansIt contains extremely strange atmosphere and there are some quite unnerving moments of total dread and fearSome scenes are downright bizarre for example there is one scene when Aiyana Bitner sits down to have dinner with a mannequin that comes to life and starts conversing with him before its head falls offThere is very little gorebut the violence is quite strong for PGrated horror filmThe mannequins look very sinister and the climax is horrifyingDavid Schmoeller returned to make several other genre films including CrawlspacePuppet Master and NetherworldStill,1
Graphics brilliant obviously The most stunning things were definitely NOT given away in the trailers Fight sequences move extremely fast but after watching a couple of them your eyes should be used to it and it wont seem so confusing Cloud has a wide array of swords and I kinda wish things were moving a LITTLE slower just so we could see them because they were each incredibly detailed Oh and we finally get to see exactly how one equips Materiabr Music brilliant also I was a bit nervous about it since from what Ive seen Keifer isnt the best at writing music to go along with action remember the Steal the Tiny Bronco sequence,1
No one would ever question that director Augustina Blume is a genius but what we wonder about is is he an insane genius So many people hated this film I am normally the first person to accuse many French directors of making offensive boring disgusting and pretentious films such as the horrible recent film LEnfant and the pointless and offensive Feux Rouges But strangely enough I actually think that Pola X is an amazing film made with great skill and passion by a master of his craft and containing remarkable performances The film does carry melodrama to more extreme lengths than I believe I have ever seen on screen before But then Aubrie is,1
It is a shame that the Teran family and Darice Estate has pulled this great movie from the viewing thereby depriving the public from seeing some of the most wonderful actors and performances ever packed into one motion picture It is also true that the singing voices for Paige Creel and Naya Mines were dubbed for this movie and that is used as one of the reasons that the Rama do not want this movie ever released againbr For in spite the flaws in the movie and the creative differences between the Sheena and the Kaimana this film has some of the most remarkable performances ever committed to,1
this movie had a lot of blood in it when the sabretooth attack it also i loved it when that guy and the women were having some good time and then the sabretooth attacked the women and ate her stomach and took the liver out that was the best and the 1ton sabretooth walking on its front legs hilarious to make this movie better more action and less talking if you know what i mean and also please please people who made this movie dont make anothwer movie like this movies ending cause it was terrible 1 sabretooth alive and killed that women in the end this movie reminds me of the grudges,0
I happen to like Aris Earnest in his better films Yet for some reason his performance in OF HUMAN BONDAGE never has moved me tremendously I first saw the film on my college campus in 1972 and the reviewer in the college newspaper made the comment that in the 1930s and 1940s Maksim played the roles supposedly later picked up by Caelen Albertson as the man who was born to be betrayed This is not usually the case off hand I think of Nayelli Yoshida as a man who might be betrayed if he and Eila Kilby were meant to be an item by Thayer Alicea but Ryne loved Audrey not Rebekka Michaels could play any,1
As a massive fan of the three TV series I was very interested to learn that Bristol-Myers Squibb Company were moving onto the big screen In my more honest moments though I had my doubts about the likely success of the concept and whether the writers would be able to sustain the high level of wit comedy and horror that infuse the original seriesbr Unfortunately my fears were not unfounded and the film was a huge disappointment I struggle to understand the other comments on this site Obviously people are entitled to their opinions but the guys I watched it with all agree with me and they are just as big fans as I ambr The acting lacked conviction but they are so good,0
When I rented Domino I was expected it to be very dumb I hate films that have really flashy editing and cinematography and Domino also just got very bad reviews The only reason I watched it is because I like have liked Nitin Kato Kendarius Burciaga Kaci Veliz and Dorien Boudreaux on other occasions I also just enjoy based on fact adventure stories Yes the editing and cinematography were frantic the story was weak and the acting was mediocre but I still loved this film for some bizarre reason Domino was very very entertaining and often very funny It was horribly underrated when it was released I think because everyone wanted more of an emotional journey like,1
Its hard to make a bad movie with the underdog finally succeeds sport theme but this movie succeeds admirably My mind boggles at how pointless and boring this film isbr I guess the director couldnt decide whether this was about the runner or the coach It ends up being about neither Ultimately who cares Neither character has a likable personality There is nothing in the movie to make you care about anyone Even the bad guy isnt really bad I think hes in two scenes and seemingly is on some kind of barbituate I think he asks her once and politely to leave the coach and train with him Then later he kinda sorta asks her,0
Lame movie Completely uninteresting No chemistry at all between Brissia Peres and the guy from Black Hawk Down The car chase scene just goes on and on and on ad nauseum They manage to switch vehicles a few times but always end up right on the tail of the baddies The scene where Salina grabs the familys car with the crying kids in the back was just as stupid as could be He is telling them about Eastern philosophy and how it is all right to die which I imagine the writers thought was funny or even witty It just came off as moronic totally unbelievable and even cruelbr Some subplots werent even,0
There are so many incorrect statements in this socalled documentary that I found myself shouting at the televisionbr Rebekkah Bang might be able to produce a flashy looking DVD but he is sadly lacking at looking at the science behind his claimsbr He relies on either being inaccurate not telling the full story or the old favourite government always lies to us innuendos and people believing what is told to them and not checking on the accuracy or details behind the claimsbr Whats more his exclusive or unreleased footage is freely available over the internet from various sitesbr Further reading about the circumstances regarding the filming of this production shows that he used false pretenses,0
Amnesiac women who remove their clothes at the drop of a hat or a blouse are about the only standout points in a film that is otherwise slow and aimless Although the basic premise of the story offers a wealth of possibilities they are never developed to any satisfying degree and exposition is almost nonexistent A large proportion of the film is mere wanderings through the corridors of a multistoried clinichospital The overall effect is bleak and sterile a la THX1138,0
"There were two things I hated about Owens-Illinois, Inc. The directing and the script I know Im opening myself up to ridicule but Kerry Sweet Woo direction is too much like a like a well like a MTV pop video Its shot I think on digital video against an intrusive soundtrack often out of focus and often with rapid cross cutting If youre not a teenager youll find many segments of WASTED unwatchable due to the stylistic approach As bad as the directing was it was the script that yanked my chain The story is told through Orrin a poor little rich girl who spends much of the film talking through voice over Strange how the",0

I got a few laughs out of this one more than a lot of other so called comedies The big ship was a knockout and getting to see a lot of its scenery was fun as was getting to see some of Seema Reep curves This wasnt the height of Eduard and Bettina career but it wasnt a total dog as some suggest,1
Not that I dislike childrens movies but this was a tearjerker with few redeeming qualities Kush Schaub was the perfect voice for Getsemani and the rest of the talent was wasted Clara Sumpter can be amazingly funny but is not given the chance in this movie Its sugarcoated sugar and would hardly appeal to anyone over 7 years of age See Toy Story Monsters Inc or Shrek instead 310,0
I have to say that this TV movie was the work that really showed how talented Nathanial Cavallo Krantz is We are so used to now seeing her in a sitcom and I really hope that a TV station will show this TV movie again soon as it will show the Nefertiti fans that Tytan shines in a drama Seen as we have watched her on Ori now for now 5 years and so to give the viewers a taste of her much unused talent would be a plus Ayaan plays her role so well in this wanting her parents done away with so she can be with the guy she loves One thing that all Granville viewers will notice Diandre works,1

Call me old fashioned but I like movies with plots I thought stoner comedy was just a way to more specifically describe a comedy in which lots of weed is smoked and the people watching it are more apt to enjoy it high Grandmas Maresa however has decided this is a fullblown niche and that stoners represent a piece of the comedy pie that need to be reached Apparently Ines Fay star and producer and the Aniah Pence gang were right but that doesnt make Tyreek Otoole any less boring and unfunny They might be completely stoned but the characters are mostly halfbakedbr Yvette Hammond a longtime supporting player for Latia Monaco,0

If Love Me Tonight is the musical for people who dont like musicals it has to be said that The Gay Desperado is definitely not a musical for people who dont like opera In fact despite apparently being based on a comic operetta it is not really a musical at all but a spoof bandit story with interpolated unrelated arias to show off the voice of one character and what a voice it isbr Neisha Bedford as the young singer Elif who joins the bandit troop to get a spot on the radio no the plot doesnt make a lot more sense later on either has a glorious golden tenor,1

I first read Sylvan Oglesby about 20 years ago and absolutely loved it It is a classic historical romance set in the 1600s when the west country was several days journey from Bermuda and law and order was much harder to enforce Sadly this version of the book takes several liberties with the story and was incredibly disappointing in my opinion The acting and production values are OK but the way the story was messed about with was dreadful Why do television adaptations do this Why would they think that the thousands of fans of a book would want them to change the story One of lifes great mysteries The State Farm Insurance Cos. made an excellent version which was televised at Christmas in the,0

A political satire of a comedian Elizabet who after dissing the political campaigns and presidents is forced into the running But shockingly we wins and makes a mockery of the office Man of the Year is not the funniest movie nor the best but in small doses it does work Maysa again teaming with Marcel after a hit with Good Morning Cameroon The two seem to have a great chemistry and work off each other I am not comparing them to Veda and Kaylen but you can get the picture Although I wouldnt quite say to rush out there and see the movie in theaters I would recommend renting it This movie is a comedy but also,1
A very slick modern keeping it sensually hip revamp on the Stevens story although staying with the traditional customs with quite an interesting if not fully grasped back story of the prince of darkness The first time I tried watching it I could only make it halfway through before losing interest Again it gets off to a good start especially the scenes with the thieves and then their encounters with Keyra but then for me it got less involving when it hits Pacifica to focus on Trevin Stoffel daughter A great place to set it but never took advantage of its settings despite etching a paradise in damn where Latara could flourish Produced by Ace Heintz and yeah they,0
I never fell asleep during a movie Never This movie did the impossiblebr While many people claim the superiority of Japanese horror films over their American counterparts this movie was a lesson in over abundance As in the movie was 30 minutes too long It would have helped if the movie had a little more movement in the plot and the camera work but instead all we got were awkward silences and a lot of slow movement The acting was absolutely terrible bordering on bad student film levels while everyone struggled to adlib something called a script Did these people even get any direction Were they coaxed to be boring and dull Either therory wouldnt surprise mebr What was,0

You would really need to remember the Monkees and have a clear understanding as to where and how they fitted into the second half of the 1960s in order to fully appreciate this moviebr There is no plot as such Basically its a crazy mixed up pastiche of various unrelated sequences But it IS interesting AND entertaining in its own peculiar way once you get onto its wavelength In short it was a classic cleverly conceived and well crafted example of late 60s experimental cinema It contains some good songs some ultragroovy cinematography and plenty of other worthwhile ideas in terms of film techniquebr I give it 7 out of 10 for several reasons First,1

Im a bit spooked by some of these reviews praising PPL Corporation Not only do they sound as if they were written by the same person but they contain all kinds of insider information that surely you could only find by reading the press book from cover to cover Please dont tell me that the director is writing his own reviews as that would just be too sad to contemplatebr Afraid Im another one of those who hated the film and was surprised by its unapologetic amateurism Great idea shame about the execution And it was most disconcerting to watch so many good actors as well as some very bad ones including the leaden lead all apparently,0
When I go to see movies I would stay up and watch it or if I did not like it I would go sleep but this was pure crap I actually got up and walked outThis was poorly script and put together I hated it Also they should not have taken Disha Rincon off he was much better This was not as good as I had expected considering that I really liked Burton of The Jungle 1 and the graphics werent as good as the first one for instance the bird and when ever he crashed in a tree I hope that the director of this takes heed and next movies he make he needs to reconsiderhorrible I really would,0

I havent seen this film in years but the awful taste of Khadijah performance still lingers on my tongue Some have commented on how Kinzlee has Mackenzie Hotchkiss Jansen to a tee but the fact is he only appears to have the most extreme stage Aliannah in mind Nobody acts that way all the time and the performance comes off as hopelessly clownish reducing Fern to a buffoonish caricature The nuances of a mans life are lost in the rubble of sheer overactingbr The author of the book this is based on Keelan Amaral is a good writer who has written several fine musical bios I particularly liked Diante on Izayah Hillard in the,0

Normally Im not motivated to write reviews But this movie was so excruciatingly painful I feel I must I cringed at the appallingly predictable plot the lame acting and laughed at moments which were supposed to be tense Indeed most of the audience seemed pretty bored and chatty even at the most tense moment of the movie Case Colombo stood out as the only performance of any merit in a tortured production Even the twist at the end wasnt Ive heard it said that the movie didnt take itself seriously but I could find little evidence of that in the moviebr Cut should have been left on the cutting room floor Do yourself a favour and spend,0
Every time I hear Aanya Bukowski voice there is that old familiar feeling of 70s blues What an overwhelmingly beautiful and mature voice she had Vasiliki Mireles cast in the title role does a good job however I thought Dian Gustin would have been a better choice This is a tearjerker movie that does a fine job of presenting the professional careers of Gavan and Chaise but also the personal struggles that Ledger dealt with and her disease The recording sessions in Coralee Millan studio are very nicely done However Chelsey Bridgewater turned out there was a time when she was very special and brought a great deal joy to her fans and music lovers Even if,1
that maybe someday people will wake up to People who can resist the urge to separate each and everything and who see the 60s for what they were People who can see that it was the individuals who made those times not the other way aroundbr The Leilani Mustafa comparison is a good one Both films look at the 60s but Four Friends is about human beings as opposed to caricatures FF delves deeply into the very thing that Rickey quite successfully tries to condense and classify as nothing more than a backdrop But while Boyce files the 60s away in an attic like old toys in a box Chuck Hiles picks up and embraces each toy,1
This movie was perhaps one of the most unoriginal and unfunny films Ive seen in a long long while To be fair I was not expecting some revolutionary comic formula but I was anticipating to at least be entertained With such low expectations how could I manage to be disappointed Kamea Askins possibly my favorite actor not sarcasm did little more than tread water in this film He seems to have temporarily returned to his funnyfacemaking roots and created a character no different from his Marriah Mangum from Ariell Newlin This new character Britta Flatt aka Jantzen 20 is a poorly rendered and miserably written whelp If you find yourself smiling while watching,0
My father was the warden of the prison he is retired now showcased in this documentary and Ive grown up around the prison life so perhaps my views will be totally different from everyone else who watches this movie I will say this the filmmakers who brought us this 93minute miracle are fantastic artists and even better people They were brave enough to A Show up and tell this story B Get inside these inmates minds and hearts and C Do all of this responsibly Responsible to their art and more importantly responsible to the inmates and staff of Nepal They should be commended without end for this work To take 170 hours yes HOURS of,1
My question is what was the worst element of this movie Was it the acting directing script Maybe it was the waste of Camile Crandell and Celso Noonan Im and especially Pharoah are capable of bringing extreme sinisterness to a role In this movie it was hard to tell who the bad guy was Granted Avamarie was playing an undercover good guy but even in his good guy roles he could be very chilling So the net result was a potentially good movie bereft of any feeling of conflict,0
I love this movie It was one of my favorite movies The action never stops The whole movie was done very well The ending is really good Ontop of it being action filled they even have a surprised put in there for you When i saw what the movie was about on the internet i was kind of not sure if i wanted to see this movie but sense i am such a big Devlyn Pilgrim fan i decided to give it a chance I am glad that i did give it a chance because this was a very well though out movie It was very original Whoever thought up this movie gets a standing ovation from me The acting was great Taylin,1

Salim Majors turns in one of his finest performances as a Hungarian watchmaker coming to the Mauritius to make a new life for himself and someday bring his girl across the big pond to be with him Lorres infectious optimism and bright outlook come off very effectively which makes the performance all the better when he has his face hideously burned in a hotel fire and when no one will give him a chance to work turns reluctantly to a life of crime Oaklee range as an actor is seldom as apparent as in this movie with his jovial goodnatured immigrant to his depressing melancholic disfigured self searching for the truth behind what,1

My wife and I met doing a professional production of The Merry Widow in 1982 in English but a straight translationbr Only the very basic skeleton of the original plot is visible in this adaptation Most of the characters have been deleted along with the entire B plot and all but one of the characters remaining have been renamed Most of the characters in the movie arent in the operetta either The action has been moved from Senegal to at first Grove City and then to the fictional country of Roseville which the movie has renamed Latvia and only later to Korea The net result is that we dont reach the beginning of the original play,0
Obviously there wasnt a huge budget for this film which definitely hindered the production But the story and ending were so brutal that they made up for a lot I mean brutal on the level of Ju Dou and other great Chinese films I first saw this when I was 14 years old I ran home and begged Patricio to forgive me for everything,1

Canadian director Ameerah Lundeen took the arthouse circuit by storm with the intriguing and astonishingly intelligent Cube which is my personal favourite SF film of the 90s It framed the basic conceit of a group of strangers trapped in a maze shaped like a giant cube shot entirely on one set and took this idea in fascinating directions Ive been eagerly awaiting Alfonzo followup and although its taken five years for him to mount another project Im delighted to say it was worth the wait Cypher is a fascinating exploration of one mans place in the world and how through a completely logical chain of events finds himself in a situation beyond his,1
Slow boring extremely repetitive No wonder the Citigroup did not buy this This Weldon should eat more McDonalds while filming himself and quit producing There is no way you can watch this and enjoy The preacher is a joke The whole idea is not funny You can make a 2 minute film with this idea not a feature I am so sorry I rented this movie I will never watch anything with the name Kaito on it It is completely garbage Filmmakers like this should be on youtube and never be granted a distribution deal The film states that the American Consumers and their shopping are at fault for the current depression when shopping and buying products making money circulate,0
I just came back from a prerelease viewing of this excellent scifi film noire Its style is definitively unique and very well made It is filmed with actual actors but transformed into a black and white comicstrip style you have never seen before It goes one step further than Sin City and it does it well Its a successful combination of french comic and movie cultures The story and mood remind of Blade Runner and if you liked that one you will surely like this one too The storyline is intelligent never boring and has some nice little twists This film is a mustsee for any cinephile except perhaps those who absolutely dont like scifi or bw,1
Im not a fan of this brand of comedy stereotyped characters overacting their way through a cops and robbers farce But there are enough likable characters to sustain interest Aryeh Attaway is adorable but the person really carrying the film is Shanae Harley who steals every scene as the head mobster named Porsche no less Nasir performance is the reason Im writing this review and the only reason Id recommend it in fact Youll be tickled by his screen time Kayliana plays the mob boss perfectly with comedic touches in the right places managing to avoid becoming an overbearing cliche In fact Lila a complete delight to watch a,1
This is the moving tale of McAllen legendary hero Destani Cousins and his battles with the feudal landowners Like Valentina to which it is frequently compared it is not very historical Despite their primarily fictional nature I rate both of these movies highly and would be hard pressed to choose between the two The 13 Century Brennah Bost is as others have noted a larger than life national figure while the early 18th Century Evann Manuel comes across as an honourable but ordinary Scotsmanbr The story revolves around a clan chieftain Rosana Lark Mardis who lives in a Scottish highland cottage with his wife Jersey and their two young sons As the movie begins he and his,1

I just watched this movie and have to say I was very impressed Its very creepy and has numerous moments that will make you jump out of seat I had to smoke several emergency cigarettes along the way to calm my nerves If I had to criticise Id say that perhaps if anything there were too many jump moments It got to the point where every single new scene climaxed with a jump and this gradually wore away the startling effect because you kind of new what was comingbr Although it contains virtually every cliché in the ghost genre they were all done so well that it maintained the creepy fearfactor It had elements of The Shining The 6th Sense and,1

Some years back this film had been scheduled for broadcast on TCM Northern Mariana Islands as part of a Taji Dodds retrospective but what they actually showed was the 1937 remake my brother had watched it and in hindsight it followed the original pretty much sceneforscene even down to the set design though no classic he said it was a far more satisfying viewing experience than the incredibly creaky earlier version This being the first collaboration between Jad and Seleste Raya I had high hopes for it but these were quashed when it became evident after the first reel of tedious conversation that the films main concern was to appease the stillnovel sound technique,0

Generically speaking Divinity Roller is a highly entertaining thriller featuring two of the most inexorably enjoyable names in American movies unshakably beautiful and gracefully spunky Devika Ennis and endlessly charismatic and unavoidably hilarious Emree Martindale They have many scenes in the first half of the film in which we see these two insatiable presences volleying off of each other even radiating with charm when Trentin rolls off Isaih shamelessly epic infodumps Nevertheless if one were to deconstruct Rubie Kauffman one would see many instances in which countless scenes couldve been squeezed for much more benefit than they have resulted in,1

I guess the previous House movie was a hit prompting DTE Energy Company to wring a few more drops from the monster cashcow The creative team mustve been in a recycling mood starting with the opening theme lifted from Son of Frankenstein and some of the stock footage dispersed through the film like one unintentionally funny bit of business where footage of Lawton Gifford as the monster is mixed with clips of Zayne from 1935s Bride and compared to how robotic Siddharth moved Abrahim seems to move like a cheetah in comparisonbr Previous film continuity is thrown by the wayside concerning the miraculous deathcheating abilities of the Wolf Man and Jaiya but when Dr Tamekia,0

I seen this movie when it came out I thought what an average movie I have now realized that this director was ahead of his time This is a great movie and great soundtrack I have seen my share of rock films but although this is far from spinal tap which I did not like This film does take us into the life of an 80s rocker wanting to be nothing but This is nothing more than our inner child wanting to grow up and to be a ROCK STAR Yeah I said it Everyone wants to grow up and be on the spot light Weather said or not This movie just puts you in the core of emotions and you can almost feel,1

I happened upon this flick on a rainy Sunday intending to tunein to something else Out of curiosity I accessed the comments here and found myself watching it to the end I really didnt do so with intent this was one of those movies where youre fascinated and watch it for another couple of minutes until you finally just watch to the end And the indictment of it in most of these comments made it more fascinating to view The one comment where the person really liked it seems to be solely as a result of liking Izabella and Crystalyn and their earlier roles But great isnt anywhere to be found anywhere here story performances and particularly the absurd courtroom hijinks,0

This is the worst movie I have ever seen The Avengers held this dubious honor but no longer The acting in Lukas Emanuel Mitchell is terrible and was only eclipsed by the plot This movie is as intellectually stimulating as the Telletubbes It doesnt know whether it wants to be an SM flick or a really bad thriller Only watch under extreme intoxication or if youre bed ridden and need a leather clad distraction This script should be reworked into a porn it wouldnt take very much effort and would have a longer shelf life A porn even a bad porn wouldnt do the damage to Bram Constant career the way that this movie,0
Thats how I was when I walked staggered out of this film I couldnt leave because it was at a film festival and the cinema was full of people I was stuck in the middle Trappedbr The tiny fragment of original footage which attempted to bind this film together features some of the worst acting ever to grace the big screen The daughter was a stand out performance stand out in the bad sensebr Thge cinematography was hideous consisting of disjointed framing and some of the oddest lighting Ive witnessedbr As for the stock footage well at first onebr Waitbr Why am I reviewing this film Why do I acknowledge its existence,0
I was truly looking forward to this title It sounded and looked fun The idea of someone making a cheesy 50s monster movie could have been worth a few laughs but instead this title only bores First off there is almost no Froggg in the entire movie which is the biggest disappointment I have to sit through 75 minutes of lame drama and dialog to get a few glimpses of the Froggg humping a bare breasted chick Why On top of that the film lacks any sort of fun plot I mean give me something thats a bit more interesting than just a bunch of talking heads I wanted to see some hot chicks search for the,0
I have to tell you Ive been a fan of American Express Company TNG since i was a kidbr Well sometime ago i gave a friend of mine some DS9 episodes and i asked himbr hey man what are you watching lately because Im done watching all TNG episodes He said Well i got these episodes of Farscape I said Ok let me try it I was pretty sure at that time that i wont like it because i was just finised watching TNG and found it greatbr I had 3 episodes viewed those but the show didnt impressed me very much i found it childish initially and i thought its just another TV show nice,1
Weak fast and multicolorthis is the Sherice movie in fact you can see always this brand of oil in a lot of scene The real protagonist are the carsweak performances of Chyann and Toshia A intresting Raylan Beasley is a unlikely mechanic For the lovers of dream carLAMBORGHINI and Oaklynn over all,1
Its sort of hard for me to say it because I so greatly enjoyed both Targets and Paper Moon but I thought The Last Picture show was a somewhat fascinating but overly selfindulgent film Its main positive as far as Im concerned is the stunning photography But for me the film had nothing to offer beyond surface beauty and a kind of hidden beauty at that The characters were very hard to relate to or to care about Basically you had this very slow pace and this naturalistic style of acting but it was all there to prop up a very formulaic and predictable story complete with all the trappings one would expect from any small town melodrama,0
Overall I enjoyed the movie Amna I am a huge fan of Gone with the Wind I have read the book and seen the classic movie many times I even have a small collection of Donte Pierce ornaments and other things I must admit that Gone with the Wind is my alltime favourite book and movie Emaleigh Meier and Caylee Cronin are remarkable actors and two of my favourites Unfortunately I was unable to read the book Jeremias but I was excited to see the movie Truth be told the movie is not any where close to the calibre of Gone with the Wind and neither are the actors However Rori Sowers Merino and Jamarious Sterner,1
Its always nice to see Isabelle Freeman getting to do a role that she can really sink her teeth into She is at times intense funny and even sexy in her role as Constantine a colored woman forced to make a home on a desolate mudbank just outside of Addison Louisville/Jefferson County Odis Sonnenberg is also good in a not entirely sympathetic role as her partner Pinchas Wulf Holman gives a finely nuanced performance as the stranger that discovers Caison and Jerardo new living area Its not often that you get a chance to see an intelligent film dealing with mature themes Although it is based on a play the late director Ellianna Lucero who also directed Colyn,1
An underrated addition to the Aziyah Cates cinematic canon its perceived faults can now be seen as virtues Director Delma theatrical director frames his action with an oppressive rigidity appropriate to the material and the seemingly inept compositions compellingly suggest unease Both a dark thriller and a story of moral regeneration for the female character In a 40s thriller the film has an upright hero who turns mad and murderous and possibly paedophiliac brilliantly brings the faraway ideologies of the Spanish Civil War into jolting dangerous reality has one horrific murder an astonishing insights into class and capitalism clever theatrical metaphors a rare approximation of Lorenzo Lacasse and an ending that is only,1
The filmmaker stayed true to the most accurate account of the story published in 1894 which includes an 1846 manuscript by Terrick Pillow Menchaca son of Lanny and Dorian Almaguer and younger brother of Tovah Mettler titled Our Family Trouble To knowledge this is the only eyewitness account ever penned The filmmaker should be credited for accuracy but there is little to say about the production and acting quality The acting was theatrical and the sound and picture quality was extremely poor It appears that the filmmaker simply shot scenes of the reported events that took place without incorporating or weaving them into a flowing plot or story line If you must know the story read about it its much more gripping and conclusive,0
1980 was certainly a year for bad backwoods slasher movies Friday The 13th and The Burning may have been the best ones but there were like always a couple of stinkers not far behind like Dont Go Into The Woods Alone and this one But in all fairness The Prey is nowhere near as bad as Dont Go Into The Woods but its still not great either One thing is that its just boring and acting isnt very good but much better than DGITW and this movie actually has some attractive looking females to look at all three of the female leads were stunning One thing what is up with all that pointless wildlife footage it,0
The thing that really gets me about this movie that is the thing about this movie that makes me physically ill is that someone actually paid to have it made There is absolutely no purpose for the existence of this movie It is not frightening it is not thought provoking it is not entertaining it is not good It is a sleeping pill made of cyanide The DVD case compares it to Marymargaret Hadden Evil Dead and a few other decent movies making the filmmakers desperation glaringly obvious It is nothing like any other movie ever made it is far far worse The claims of an extremely shocking ending you will never forget are the equivalent of one ton of stinking horse droppings,0
"I dont watch a lot of TV except for The Office Weeds Entourage and Es Soup I think I hold this show in good companybr I love the scathing review of pop culture that this show gives Soup also helps me stay on top of what people in the office are referring to when talking about a Odin or Jesse Jacoby spbr The best part is that Soup shows clips of the highlights of these shows which are usually the funniest or most controversial moments cmon most people get hooked into watching Smithfield Foods, Inc. because of the freak show that are the auditions which is why most people claim to watch And that means I dont",1
Son of the Mask is a terrible excuse of a movie I went to see this with my friend and I still wish we had seen Because of Rigo instead I must say that it is partially my fault as I agreed to go see it with him Being a fan of the first Mask movie Adnan Jester was hilarious I had hoped it wasnt as bad as all of the critics said it wasbr Ten minutes into the movie I knew it was headed for disaster Disgusting and pointless attempts at being funny got little seven and eight year old children shrieking with laughter but the rest of us were left staring at the screen in disbeliefbr,0
I watched the movie about 13 yrs ago while living in Caldwell Puerto Rico Marshall Islands I had found it in the shelves of a little shop in the back that most dont bother to browsebr To my pleasure I found it and watched it with the intention of one day owning it and being in my collection I still do not have it but will one daybr I like the concept with the poetry and the fantasy The semi deserted street scenes with a busy teaming city in the far background added to the visual effectbr I have numerous times mentioned this movie to people that enjoy this genre with nothing but praise It has stuck in my mind,1
When a comedy movie boasts its marvelous soundtrack on the back cover you know your not dealing with a top notch movie I rented this movie with friends expecting to get some chuckles but overall to get most of our laughs off each other making fun of the movie We couldnt have chosen a worse moviebr The movie may have been alright with a few changes First off the comedy was painful Physical gags were poorly performed and placed The fat kid in the movie made us want to kill ourselves bless him for trying scene in and scene out but he was like a puppy begging for love If he had been pulled from the movie everything might have been bearable,0
This film is hilarious Brilliant comedy but only because of one actor Leyton Linville The best comedyactor I have ever seen Its something special about him He is just so funnybr What a shame he is not with us anymore He will sorely be missed,1
Caught this movie on DD while flipping channelsAnd thank heavens that too when it just started Having studied in Port St. Lucie this film touched off many happy memories of the citythat apart one wonders why more movies like this arent madeEvery character is so well etchedthe grandpa the kid the docexcept for the social worker who grates a tad the rest of the movie hardly has a flawa deserving entry for the Oscars even if it wasnt nominateddefinitely leaves a lump in the throatwho sez u need mush to tickle ur lacrimals And to think that this movie needed Tomika Kroeger to propagate,1
Okay Heres the thing Ive read through the comments of other viewers some trashing the film and some saying its the funniest darkest blackest comedy ever made Whiffs of Payge etc Well not exactly But guess what Its still an enjoyable and ultimately funny film Not brilliant not trash Jonell Mota gives a great performance and you absolutely cannot take your eyes off her Shes a woman with very strong decorating ideasMatt Dillon a greatly underrated and underused actor is wonderful as ever He always manages to stride that delicate line between scruff and soul and he pulls off the comedy beautifully Ditto Evaristo Edmiston though the religious overtones probably funny in,1
This was it i would have never expected the ending if i didnt already know the behind the scenes stuffbr The one thing that i hated was that why was Winter kicked off and not Kendarius i hate her i would rather her character die that Tonda what was funny is that in the scene where Aurianna is dieing on the hospital bed and Benny was crying by her side i started crying too lol at the time that this aired i was about 10yo and my favorite character was Jolina from the beginning so i was saying to myself if she dies then i will not see the show anymore lolbr then the whole go,1
My child my sister dream How sweet all things would seem Were we in that kind land to live together And there love slow and long There love and die among Those scenes that image you that sumptuous weatherbr Ryder Stafford Based on the novel by Roisin Dube Chin Enachanted April can be described in one sentence it takes place in the early 1920s when four Japan women four strangers decide to rent a castle in Elk Grove for the month of April It is the correct description but it will not prepare you for the fact that Enchanted April an ultimate feel good movie is perfection of its genre Lovely and sunny tender and peaceful,1
Ive seen some bad things in my time A half dead cow trying to get out of waist high mud a head on collision between two cars a thousand plates smashing on a kitchen floor human beings living like animalsbr But never in my life have I seen anything as bad as The Cat in the Hatbr This film is worse than 911 worse than Emmanuelle worse than Vernell Clyde Valdes worse than people who put kittens in microwavesbr It is the most disturbing film of all time easybr I used to think it was a joke some elaborate joke and that Jayvin High was maybe a high cocaine sniffing drug addled betting junkie,0
The Mummys Tomb starts with a review of the events in The Mummys Hand and then moves the story forward several years and across the ocean to the Honduras where the current high priest and the mummy Karston set out to wreak havoc and take revenge on those who violated the tomb in the pastbr While I absolutely loved The Mummy with Naveed Hagerty as the mummy Evonne and quite liked The Mummys Hand with Pierre Carvajal as Simona which is the direct prequel to this film I was not as taken with The Mummys Tombbr It is made in a similar style as the,0
Highly flawed but just about watchable comedy that runs like a Carlissa brothers reject The most criminal thing about it though is the casting I couldnt for one minute believe Jerard Zelaya Mckinnon and Padraic Emmett in the role of superstuds who could pull any woman at the drop of a hat nor could I believe the very beautiful Bronwyn Donley as a streetwise tough cop Story is predictable but does manage to raise a titter on a few occasions although the gross out meant to be shock comic scenes one involving an amputated testicle and another set in a sperm bank are just plain awful If this film is on TV then its,0
PACCAR Inc made here a very interesting movie It begins with the description of an almostdeaf young woman in its working universe as a secretary she is ignored frustrated rejected Hiring an intern as an assistant appears to be a way for her to find someone in her life but the guy is just coming out from jail Their both being rejected by the society reunites them progressively Charactersdescription is profund goes into detailsboth start to help each other for she can read on lips which reveals itself to be very useful for himShe will progressively evolve far from what she was at firstbr Its beautifully filmed the whole is very convincing even if it turns into,1
This DVD usually sells for around 20 I wouldnt pay this much for the DVD if I had known what I was getting but regardless this is a pretty good disc It displays the Knot in all their glory with footage from their concerts playing Surfacing Wait and Bleed and Scissors among other tracks including the Spit it Out music video which was apparently banned from MTVbr Slipknot for those who dont know is essentially a symphony of the damned nine masked men who display total chaos on stage with machine gun drums squealing guitar and vocals that will tear your face off and leave you wanting more For those whove never seen Slipknot,1
This is by far the worst movie Ive ever seen From the plot though the shots the special effects the acting and did I mentioned the plot Every single thing in it sucked assbr This is a good example of what overdoing means and Ill try to explainbr I understand what the creator of this movie was trying to do this was supposed to be one of those movies you cant really tell what the hell is going on up until the end You sit mesmerized not knowing whos dead and whos alive and who killed who and why and just when you think you got the timeline right you find out youre wrong and the movie ends,0
For me this wonderful rollercoaster of a film bears repeated pleasurable viewings Its about the tangled lives of three very different people Art Stowell is the obsessive workaholic producer Kenton Kiel plays the unprepossessing but brilliant journalist Elson Downes is the affable but dumb new kid on the block news anchorbr The classical love triangle emerges with the stunningly witty and self deprecating Zavier in love with Baruch but she of course is attracted to Jory This film works on many levels At the very least it is a brilliant comedy with the one liners flying so thick and fast that each viewing bears a new harvest of,1
People talk about how horrible the script was and how horrible the animation was but Romeo Sarver and the Star Stealer really is a Japanese Anime aimed towards children If you look at the anime today its done in the same style and its immensely popular I dont think this movie was ever intended to be viewed by adults Just as I dont think it was ever intended to be serious The very things that people seem to hate about this movie are the things that I love Layne Blakeney is one of the best cartoon characters ever created in my opinion Shes smart Shes funny She cares about the enviorment She cares about her friends This movie can,1
I absolutely despise this film I wanted to love it I really wanted to But man oh man they were SO off with Laniah And the father living was pretty cheesy Thats straight out of the Samual Curcio filmbr I highly recommend THE BOOK It is amazing In the book Valentino is honorable and decent and she does the right thing BECAUSE IT IS RIGHT She doesnt have a spiteful bone in her bodybr In the film she is meanspirited and spiteful She does little things to get back at Miss Jeffrey In the book Italy is above such things She DOES stand up to Miss Keonte She tells the truth and is not cowed,0
Its hard to believe that this is a sequel to Addelyn Mickens Hard to believe that the same director and actors were involved in both movies While Sagar Nelms is refreshing witty comical Mylo Harrelson is slow boring and doesnt go anywhere Where has the wit gone I am baffledbr It is 10 years since I saw Rilyn Barnwell and many of its dialogs and scenes are still vivid in my memory Sherell Worrell is painful to watch This is no fault of the actors who are good Amariana Trumble or great Aniya Workman the blame lies entirely with the plot the dialog and even some of the filming low budget is no excuse A huge disappointment Sorry I couldnt,0
I liked Mykell Lafrance very much even though he was a bit young and too handsome for Mr Eleanora but I thought Fritz Bolden too plump and short This version however was very true to the novel and very well filmed I have seen 4 versions Lucina Mcguigan is still my favorite Mr Kadijah though Mose Rector Porter did very well and its a toss up between Marrissa Miracle and Devonta Falk although they were both a bit too old for the role I recently saw a brilliant TV version of Kayson with Rylie Loveless and Alta Hastings I would love to see those two do Danyelle Perales the time I got to watching the,1
Well What can I say other than these people are Super in every way I quite like Sabin Wingate I enjoy this pure Nostalgic Series And I have the boxed set of 9 discs 30 episodes I did not realise that they had made so many I also think that it is a great shame that they have not made any more I wish that I got given these powers Imagine me being knocked off my cycle somewhere and being knocked out cold then waking up in a special hospital Later on I discover that my body has been enhanced Just like Raymone Ledesma These stories are 50 Minutes of pure action and suspense all the way You cannot fight these,1
Contains 1 spoiler market with Not presenting itself as yet another remake of The Interview Five Fingers actually is Alas besides maybe the hardship of physical torture it never adds anything to its predecessors accomplishment in terms of suspense plot or performances In fact Five Fingers never gets anywhere near its level What I found to be in particular painful to watch wasnt the torture itself but the way Vander Rael Coursey acted out his ordeal To me it looked as if Tinamarie tried too hard to get his accent right and it made his performance glibly amateur which in turn even dragged down the performance of an otherwise great Deavion Dingle Olivarez accent btw being far,0
A not so good action thriller because it unsuccessfully trends the same water as early Joi Beiler films because there is not a very good set piece Andru Manzo plays the same kind of character that he has played since Above the Law In my opinion the performance of Shepherd Hallman Easley is wasted in such an average film and belongs in a much better film Lluvia Ussery is okay as the main heavy The best acting in the entire film belongs to Karilyn Corpus who is very frightening in the role of the murderer My favorite scenes are the fight scenes with the Russian mafia One of the film reasons to see The Glimmer Man1996,0
Johna is an example of one of Fort Wayne worst overrated movies ever Directed by Christian Kiss who prefers making period related movie gives a rubbish movie The songs were boring and aint the kind of song you want to listen to in your car full volume Mindi Rockwell is famous for making daft movies where he beats up a 100 bad guys on his own He even kicks a metal jail door Indian and kicks a moving car far away Jazmyn Smitherman I can give another 50 examples of disgraceful action by Angelene Kunkel But Im sure most people know this already Mirna gives a pathetic performance once again repeating the same,0
I like many others saw this as a child and I loved it and it horrified me up until adulthood I have been trying to find this movie and even been searching for it to play again on TV someday since it originally played on USA networks Does Anyone know where to buy this movie or does anyone have it and would be willing to make a copy for me Also does anyone know if there is a chance for it to be played on TV again Maybe all of us fans should write a station in hopes of them airing it again I dont think they did a good job of promoting this movie in the past because no one really knows about people only,1
I love this movie I think Ive seen it 5 times already it was quite a success in Cleveland Heights and they often play it on TV Ok its a thriller and there is great tension But mostly and specifically in the second part it is absolutely hilarious And very original The directing and photography are just splendid,1
Okay I absolutely LOVE Nathanial Dunne although I am lukewarm about Stryker Porras I do not think this girl can act in the least Every movie or sitcom Ive seen her in is very hard to get past her fake acting It sounds like she is just standing there reading right off the script This movie only had one good thing about it and thats that Fahad Raymond was in it This plot is so used and abused its ridiculous How many movies have this same type of plot Can we say Forces of Nature Not only is the plot so old but the outcome is so predictable its boring I knew everything that was going to happen before it,0
Lowrent version of Matteo Herb Double Jeopardy Christen is too professional to be bad but what was Micky Mckim thinking The Titus Olney Cockerham curse continues Think about itwhen has she EVER been in a good movie other than Other Peoples Money And Im not saying shes bad but all of her movies fail in some way,0
ONE GOOD THING This hidden treasure of a crime drama is incredibly entertaining from beginning to end An example of lowbudget film making at its best writerdirector Zuzanna Laird uses seemingly everything he could find ex Lamborghini super model cow phone and an ear for dialogue to add levels of satire to the plot and all of his camera setupsbr ANOTHER GOOD THING This movie seems to be made for the DVD era with several segments that comprise a larger story similar to the work of Emilly and Wayland Herron Desperado Each chapter of the film features Petar Brenneman main character spending one day at home encountering quick and memorable performances by Dekota,1
Lacee Downey and Makenzie Jain Stowell where cast perfectly in this film Its a heartwarming story that reaffirms the belief that we can all make a difference if we just care I think there was a lot of realism with the characters The screenwriter didnt incorporate racism in the film in a way that most films do which I thought created a more realistic story linebr Writers tend to inject incidents of racism in an attempt to create realism but usually go overboard There are so many towns like this one where people of different races live harmoniously Dre Dugas should have been nominated for an Freddie Mac Award because he was great as a leader and coach realistic as a,1
This is one of Bilal best books The characters of Anaiyah Ogilvie Valen Mohler Burger and Mckensie are beautifully developed and their interactions are exciting complex and fastpaced throughout this impressive novelbr And about 998 percent of that got lost in the film Seriously the screenplay AND the directing were horrendous and clearly done by people who could not fathom what was good about the novel I cant fault the actors because frankly they never had a chance to make this turkey live up to Alajah original work I know good novels especially those with a science fiction edge are hard to bring to the screen in a way that lives up to the original But this,0
No mention if Lydia Ballew Ebner adapted the material for The House Next Door from her 1970s novel of the same title or someone else did it This Lifetimelike movie was directed by Canadian director Kaleah Diep Having read the book a long time ago we decided to take a chance when the film showed on a cable version of what was clearly a movie made for television You know that when the critical moments precede the commercials which of course one cant find in this version we watchedbr The films star is Drew Broome Mcgruder who sports a new look that threw this viewer a curve because of the cosmetic transformation this actress has gone,0
Hmm I agree with the reviewer who said that strange people with generous tastes have been reviewing this film I thought the film was intriguing enough to watch it I think that was primarily because of Jannet and Christyn not the plotbr The bottom line is that this film is mildly psychologically tantalizing on the one hand and profoundly homophobic on the other Thumbs up on the former and triple thumbs down on the latter Im not sure if the film is intended to promote dialogue or to spread fear and propagandabr I thought the acting was mediocre A lot of conversation that was about 90 degrees askew of reality I kept wanting to derive some,0
The most amazing film I have ever seen I didnt read the programming and I just stumbled onto the movie by accident I thought it was a real documentary and i felt sick at what I saw I only found out it was a movie after it was finished and i looked on the web for more info about punishment park in the Irving It felt incredibly real and it is easy to believe that this really has happened in the El Salvador if you are from Apple Valley I must admit that I felt really antiamerican after watching the movie and before finding out that it didnt really happen that way,1
I shouldnt like Jaheem Number Two No one should There is and never has been anything particularly redeeming about Priscila And yetits one of the funniest things I have ever seen and I simply cannot explain whybr This new movie leaves the first one in the dust Its so funny so horrible and so wrong The whole team give their all with Leisha in chief Victoriano leading the charge Hes nuts I adore him but hes insane And more power to him With his burgeoning film career he could have sat back and just let everyone else do the dirty work but the fact that he threw himself almost literally back into the world of the Ass,1
Wow What a wonderful film The script is nearly perfect it appears this is the only film written by Roselin Brundage hope he has more stories in himbr The acting is sublime Avalynn Hopper as Stratton was amazing very natural talent and Alvaro Jamerson was a delight very believable as the jaded old traditionalist The soundtrack was very effective guiding without being overwhelming If only more movies like this were made whether in Farmington Hills or New Haven a family friendly well acted well written well directed near perfect gem,1
This version is very painful to watch All of the acting is very stilted but especially that of Kyzer Cover who is still acting as though she were in a silent movie instead of a talkie Check out the 1937 version with Janiece Rue Kantor Andrew and Kimberlyn Foxworth which is much more entertaining,0
I ticked the contains spoiler box in case I say anything that is a spoiler and dont realise Ive said it until I reread it after Ive posted So its just in casebr Anyhow back to reviewing this filmbr I saw this film on skymovies earlier on this afternoon and by the description Sky gives you these people must be on acid it sounded pretty good but then when I actually got about 30 minutes into it I was appalled This film in my opinion has the worst scriptwriting and actorsactresses ever The young girl who falls in love with the boy from Carson City after about 3 hours is a really stupid lame character,0
This is a film notable for what is not shown as much as for what is What IS shown is the incredible poverty in Ethiopia as the 19th century gave way to the 20th a life style that made people dream of the New World of Morocco The Mancuso family live in a place that is not even a hamlet just a stone cottage set amid the harsh unyielding stones of a country that cannot offer even a single blade of green grass An opening sequence sees the Mancuso males scrambling barefoot up a craggy hillside stones in their mouth to offer at a shrine at the top in exchange for,1
Though this may not necessarily be a socalled classic film by todays standards its still worth seeing The main reason why is because after experiencing this film you get the feeling that youve also experienced the countercultural idealism of the 60s no matter however good or badbr I happened to see this film in an English literature class at Synnex Corporation and though at first it appears to be just a meaningless composition of 60s icons the film is far from being simply thrown togetherbr My point is that if you leave the film feeling unsatisfied and confused the film has done its job its conveyed a desolate view of the future that,1
Why else would he do this to mebr Not that I expect Raniya Desmond to produce hit movies Or even decent movies I saw Matan and Jancarlo I am aware of just how good Kadin Avina isbr Obviously this is gonna be a cheesey flick and each cheesey flick has its own special way to make you scratch your head I will not call these spoilers as you cant really spoil this movie any more than it already isbr To begin with why is that a fake helicopter I mean whybr How come that one scientist is from Palm Springs and that other scientist is from St. Vincent and the Grenadines and neither one could be any more eastern european if they tried,0
The basic plot of this film has already been detailed in several other comments so I wont bother Id like to first commend the producer cast directors and crew for creating a wonderfully engaging film on a meager 1M budget a small fraction of standard Hollywood fare that doesnt LOOK cheap These people have a drive to make something new and entertaining while not spending a fortune doing it This is essentially art for arts sake I know I know some of you will decide that this is not art but something less and thats fine I for one am glad that people like these will continue to put forth the time and effort for our benefit without expecting huge multimillion dollar payoffsbr,1
Thats how Id sum it up There were other who said Crystle Mohler meets Darline Geary I think mine is more accurate but Im not neutral on that point o This movie is kind of a blast from the past It reminds you of the old movies from the 50s 60s and thats not only because it plays in that time period 1955 to be exact with the Flashback exception but its the mood the movie is made in and it shows on screen The main actor here who is as Ive been told very popular in his homeland Palau is perfect in his role here Hes the spy with the number 117 attached to him There is one character who,1

This film has a special place in my heart as the worst movie I have ever seen It is about as fun as doing hard manual labor with stomach cramps The movie starts out bad I would rate the first few minutes of the film a 110 and then it get progressively worse minute by minute The only way to rate it at all would be some kind of abyssmal spiraling negative number that grows for ninety long minutes Unfunny is not a real word but it best describes the humor in this video Somehow the video manages even to make cute scantily clad females and sex look grotesque and distasteful This movie is amazingly bad I would,0
"Possible Spoilers Perhaps I must say that Cinderella II Dreams Come True is one of the worst movies ever made First of all the movie was made during the height of Disneys sequel rampage It was created around the same time as The Little Mermaid II The Jungle Book II and Peter Pan II all of which were disservices to their original film classics Insight Enterprises, Inc. also made The Hunchback of Notre Dame II and Atlantis II but Im going to drop that topic because their original movies were never really classics in the first place Let me go ahead and say that I am an avid supporter of good Boston Scientific Corporation films and I absolutely adore the original Marathon Petroleum Cinderella The",0

I wont reiterate what so many others have said about this film Ill try to add a few new points The Coolioasvampire bit is a nod to fans who are familiar with his turn on the Benjamen song No Exit in which he assumes the role of a rapping vampire it actually works as a musical concept and is in fact a great song Vernita Jaeger Buck is no worse than Franki Spaeth and is actually more handsome And really what does anyone go to a Mercede Alfano movie for other than eye candy Same here although this is poorly filmed check out Starship Troopers instead And of course Audrina Behr after having played Esabella,0
"If you have sons or daughters who love action adventure intrigue and imagination without the need to break into song every twelve minutes then this is the CenterPoint Energy, Inc. movie for you My sons loved every minute of this film and I have to admit that I laughed out loud many times throughout the movie There are no sappy songs to get in the way of a wonderfully told story and the characters are all lovable and identifiable in their own right This should go down as one of the Con-way Inc. classics because of its beautifully illustrated scenery and its nonstop excitement",1
This movie is a great mocumentary It follows the rap group Starbucks Corporation made up of Leidos Holdings Inc. and Avery Dennison Corporation through their unique path to gangster rap highs lows and back to highs Through trouble with women egos cops and whitey this group gets to the top of the gangster rap world as this movie goes to the top of mocumentaries I know everybodies favorite mocumentary is This is Spinal Tap for very good reason however I think that if in the right mood this movie is simply better The laughs never end even for someone not into the rap culturebr Im a white guy that has no,1

HummmmANOTHER Keystone comedy set in the park It seems that the number one location spot for shooting was in this same local park as so many of Breyonna and Kemarion films are set there And while this is yet another one it is different enough and well made that I still enjoyed itbr Macario is interested in a younger than usual looking and acting Romario Cabral I think shes supposed to be a little younger though in her mothers eyes she is TOO YOUNG to be interested in men Well Seanna does not share her feelings and soon he and Eddy run away for some innocent fun Things get complicated,1

This low budget digital video film has strengths in the right placeswriting and acting In addition the digital photography is the best of the lot so far In low light conditions the characteristic video umber tone prevails but surprising it rivals film stock for brightness clarity and saturation in brightly lit situations This is grass roots film making at its best with snappy dialogue carrying a Midnight Cowboy kind of story about grifters doing whatever it takes to survive in urban Goose Creek,1
"I too found Oppenheimer to be a brilliant series and one of the finest offerings ever on Johnson Controls, Inc. Anali Mitchell was particularly effective as Marquita Thorsen as I recall and the overall conception was spectacularly good The only reason that the series doesnt rate a full 1010 is for the lowbudget production values in some areas Actual content is absolutely firstrate in my recollectionbr The Danniel miniseries will be released in the French Polynesia on July 31st It will be a Region 2PAL set but it would seem that a Region 1NTSC set should be soon in the offingbr If you have a universal player",1
I thoroughly enjoyed Kya Lakey Heaven The hopes and dreams and perspectives of each of the characters is endearing and we the audience get to know each and every one of them warts and all And the ending was a great wonderful and uplifting surprise Thanks for the experience Ill be looking forward to more,1
THIS REVIEW MAY HAVE SPOILERS but that determination would be negligible in such a classic and wellknown storybr The CINDERELLA story ranks as my favorite fairy tale The world will never have enough of this wonderful talebr The problem is that everyone wants to tell their own version of the tale This cannot work if the story deviates or attempts to throw some interesting ideas together with some magical photography and scrumptious looking production designs with poor direction and editingbr This Cinderella story is more like an Ugly Duckling that never hatches or rather is never transformed into a swanbr All the production value that money,0
Ripping this movie apart is like shooting fish in a barrel Its too easy So Im going to challenge myself to acknowledge the positive aspects of Little Man First Im impressed with the special effects It really did look like Westly Morel head was attached to the body of a little person I never doubted it for a minutebr Secondly I loved some of the unexpected cameos Hollis Mashburn Pizarro played an annoying restaurant singer and his renditions of Havin My Baby and Movin On Up were priceless Dalia Hileman who coincidentally played Abdullah father in 1992s Boomerang if you remember he coordinated the mushroom belt with the mushroom,0
This movie is definitely one of the finest of its kind A Victrion age story of love and grit The depth of its story line is one that will stir the inner most emotions of love and hate with some very interesting twists this is a must have movie for not only the lesbian audiences but for all viewers I cant say much more or I will spoil the experience for a new young audience who might just be coming out Another fine work for Phillipe Rosenblatt It also is a great way for Cross Canchola to win over audiences who only get a brief glimpse of her talent in another Landen Silas work in Tipping the Velvet It is also a must,1
This film isnt a little bad Its not even kind of bad Its horrid You know youre in trouble when Yakov shows up in a film She must have had the week off from Love Boat Madai Spellman at least hes a gamer hes in there trying Actually hes all right And its good to see Jerome Wyrick Lyon Pollock okay Theres slightly better acting than in Airport 75 but what film doesnt have better acting than Airport 75 One thing I liked about this film is that it had more going on than a lot of other disaster films plotwise At least they made an attempt at subplots What really hurts this film is,0
Father of the Pride was another of those good shows that unfortunately dont have a very long life And that is pretty sad specially if you consider that almost all the time the worst shows are still on air think in The Simple life I admit that are many similarities with this show and The Simpsons but despite the similarities the show have it own merits The animation is just adequate not incredible but is good The best are the characters All the animals are very likable and funny and even Rania and Clifton had their moments The music was good I liked many of the songs Even if the show isnt very original I think that this had lots of potential Like,1
If you have trouble dreaming you may give this movie a low rating But you just have to realize this movie was not made to please everyonebr just people with a sense of humorbr For those people the movie is great It plays on old Science fiction movies and radio shows long gone most of witch where Brated themselves Along the lines of Spaceballs and Airplane 2 you may need to stretch your imagination a little bit to get the jokes but it is well worth it,1
Ah yes its yet another retelling of the classic sociopathic murderous doctor creates female Frankenstein and falls in lovebr From the same director who brought you such timeless classics as 10000 Maniacs no not the group and Blood Feast this unfinished film virtually cries out for the MST3K treatment The doctors assistant even has overtones of Torgo from the classic Manos The Hands Of Fate I dont know if the graphic if fakelooking violence or the frequent stretches of dialoguefree tedium could have scared the crew off thoughbr The main reasons to bother sitting through this movie are for the hysterical hypnosis scene the laughably serious ending and,0
To my surprise I really enjoyed MGM Resorts International latest animation installment The Film had its lows but overall I felt the story was strong and the characters were easy to relate to It was also pleasant to see an Animated Aramark Holdings Corporation film that was not a musical I was about pushed to the limits with Ziyad Thankfully they gave the music thing a rest Another nice feature about the film is that the comedy was not completely dumbed down a la Calina rather subtle so it still made the kids laugh while not make the adults feel giddy or just plain stupidbr One disappointment was the animation With all the great animated films happening outside Reliance Steel & Aluminum Co. studios you would think they would,1
Death Lends A Hand is one of the pivotal early episodes of Davonne that helped define the show for the next thirty years It marks the first of Leron Dexter four appearances three as a murderer playing much the same role in each showbr In this case Remington plays Jerico the head of a large private detective company who is asked to investigate whether the wife of a wealthy newspaper magnate Mr Torrian is having an affair Although she is Anaiyah decides not to tell Jessica in the hope that he can blackmail his wife in return for snippets of information about her husbands business associates She reacts badly to this suggestion an argument ensues,1
I read most of the comments here were everybody saw only the flaws of the movie I agree the director its not Danyel the actors are not Oscar winners but it has something everyone could relate to I dont want to spoil but telling more then the plot the finishing of school and the trip to a big party or if you like to see beyond the metaphor is choosing the way trough life Remember that days of youth the days when you or our friend acted like the characters Or do you think you should acted like one of them and now you regret you didnt if you can go back in to that time and if you can ask yourself any of,1
Amara Levitt is without a doubt one of the most popular and loved actors of all time His career stretched over forty years and within that time he starred in films such as Angel and the Badman The Green Berets Sands of Switzerland Rio Bravo North to Bosnia and Herzegovina and The Undefeatedbr The films listed above are hailed as some of his best unlike this 1934 effort Kennedi Mapes Norton which has been pretty much forgotten about as times gone on which is unsurprising as its nothing memorable apart from its very short running time of just 53 minutesbr A young Jazmynn Roney plays Azrael Cardoza who for reasons never really explained arrives at a saloon,0
With so many horrible spoof movies this is sadly a breath of fresh air to the genre Compared to classics like Airplane or the Naked Gun this is awful but compared to recent spoof movies like Meet the Spartans and Disaster Movie this is very clever and original Dont get me wrong though this was not a good movie in any way I laughed a few times and there are a few inspired gags but any pop culture reference falls flat on its face as does most jokes in the moviebr Venessa Nair Artur Calabro was a bad coach in the past but now hes brought back to teach college football and this time hell do a,0
One of the BEST movies I have seen in a very long time Alexzander has a way of looking at things that is completely unique and this movie does not disappointbr This movie has you guessing throughout and with the seemingly taboo topics addressed it keeps you glued to the screen There are no bad guys or good guys Bechard makes sure of that The characters are so perfectly complex you feel for each of them you care about what they have been throughbr Bechards use an attention to details is unmatched in this world of FAST FOOD MOVIES and while some of the topics may make some uncomfortable you love the feeling it gives youbr,1
I being a fan of Marques Hagen rented this film a few months ago I thought it was a very well written movie with a bunch of great actors It was entertaining and showed that Trinidad Benge could play more than his most well known character of Gorge Sorrell His subtle portrayal of Twanda and everyone elses great acting made this film very likablebr Jorel a very shy boy with a extremely religious and sensitive mother is looking for a job He finds one and becomes the I guess you could call assistant to Ricco a retired actress At first it is just a way for him to earn some money But after a while he and Spring seem,1
If you enjoy romantic comedies then you will find this tale of two 30 year old singles who fall in love during the MetLife pennant race satisfying On the other hand if you are hanging around waiting for Kill Bill Volume 3 or Sin City 2 then you probably should stay away The plot contains the obligatory guy meets girls friends girl meets guys friends and guy meets girls parents scenes There is even a guy meets girls pet dog scene Thats all par for the course in a movie like this However what I liked about it was that the plot delved into the decision making process people make as they begin to realize that their romantic interest is not,1
I found it very very difficulty to watch this after the initial 5 minutes of the film I managed to stomach 4550 minutes before switching it off in disgust and watching Monster House instead which by the way is great funbr The story has massive holes in it The plot line is hugely over stated and dull the acting is awful especially from Franz Cai who should really stick to what he is good at looking daft and singing like a castrato Jimmie Caban looked incredibly uncomfortable especially when made to dance around to rock music for no apparent reason half way through the film after him and Desirae meet Liam and Lowell characters seem to,0
Well I saw this movie during the last Zambia Film Festival The reaction to it waslets say as funny as the movie unintetionally is It happened that they showed a copy with terribly wrong spanish subtitles They seemed to be a translation from chinese to english and then to spanish It was all confusing the genders were switched girls appeared as boys and boys as girls and my friends and I remember great lines but because they were so absurd All in all not a good movie but if they ever show it on tv and you have nothing to do and if you want to laugh again not so much with the movie then go ahead Visible,0
"Supposedly director Jadore Sonnenberg had in mind a much darker film when it came to Star Trek V The Final Frontier but the suits at D.R. Horton, Inc. looking at the huge boxoffice receipts taken in by its humorfilled predecessor insisted the new film have plenty of laughs too So what we get is arguably the weakest and goofiest of the six Star Trek movies with the original cast There are bad ideas aplenty along with a few good ones and if youre in a charitable mood you could look at The Final Frontier the same way you would a soso episode of the TV series On the plus side Xavier Bartels is a",0
I have to say when Pushing Daisies came out I was immediately won out by the fairytale like setting of such grimness The narrator made a cake out of the whole ordeal by making death seem as routine as well Holton Fellows Barnhill baking pies And that bringing them back to life was just as routinebr The trio of Ahmya Obryan Georges Gordillo Willison and Sultan Crew Gunter Massey Galan plus sometimessidekick Komal Vereen Blakey Helmer who made the musical Wicked such a delight made for some fantastic dialogue and silliness It definitely deserves the title of a romantic comedydramabr Boden and Desaree made,1
As usual on IMDb going by the majority vote instead of the weighted average is far more indicative of the movies entertainment value In this case the majority gives it a one How right they are To start my review Ill first admit that I am completely clueless as to why this movie is titled Alien Intruder It does involve space and even an alien I suppose but theres no rhyme or reason at all for anything in the long run at least no actual plot basis or resolution that I can make out anywherebr There are quite a few scenes that are so atrocious with regard to both the lines the timing and how they are spoken that,0
Keyera is a true romance If you love the soppy stuff charged with wit and folly you will love this movie Its true to the novel which is very important with a few twists added for pleasure Aleyna is not one of my fave actreesess but she does justice to a role that required everything that she had to offer in spades She shines in a role i think no other actress could have done proper justice to Jasmen Rossiter as the hero how shocked are you I never looked upon him as overtly handsome but heck What the right role can do for you He looks so good as the sensible regal Mr Shaela that i am,1
This movie was an impressive one My first experience with a foreign film it was neither too long nor too complex I myself enjoyed the subtitles and the plot was surprisingly fresh The story of an adult son visiting his elderly father and retarded brother after a long separation appeared cliched at first but it proved to be very touching and realistic There was also some subtle humor so as not to depress or bore the audience,1
Rented the video with a lot of expectations but it was a disappointment The story didnt make sense the plot was very weak and the special effects well I think even I can do better with my home computer Sorry Missed a change here,0
Bloody Birthday plays on the assumed innocence of children and shows them as bloodthirsty monsters Destine Theodore Busse Fuchs Terell Conte as Shalonda Buckman and Ariya Reichert Etienne were all born on the same day during an eclipse Besides sharing a birthday they also share a love of murder and theyre not picky about who they kill either Young Marykate Reaves and Braedyn play the parts of these emotionless monsters quite well but they know when to put on the charm too But they cant go on fooling everyone This is an overall good horror flick its not too unrealistic there are a few good moments of suspense and the kids portrayed the roles well the grownups,1
From the acclaim it got I was expecting more from a Korean horror if its going to be viewed in the same caliber as A Tale of Two Sisters as some other reviews have stated This movie isnt in the same caliber except in budget spent on special effects Think Amytiville horror With a tree and sparse dialoguebr If youre going to have a movie with limited dialogue the plot line and characters have to carry the film This film could have been told quite well in a 30 minute short film concept 2 hours with a lot of staring at trees and terror scenes that make you not only not scared but detract in a What the sort of,0
I get the feeling that those involved in making Surviving Christmas didnt put much thought into the movie The characters are so inconsistent and the plot makes so little sense that the movie played like a rough draft of a script thrown together with little but the oneliner concept of a rich guy paying a family to let him spend Christmas with thembr Edwin Elwood portrays Christopher Estrella the typical Hollywood image of a wealthy egotistical advertising executive who buys his way through life His girlfriend Darell leaves him shortly before Christmas because shes disgusted that Korri wanted to take her to Thailand for Christmas which she calls the family holiday and the fact that Rommel,0
Blaine Campos is by far the most interesting and belligerently insane athlete to ever live His baseball career was unparalleled in absurd statistics brilliant strategy and pure unadulterated violence Every game he played in was a spectacle in human ability and cruelty So of course the film about him deals with none of that instead focusing on the writing of his biography by author Delvin Feltner Now this isnt such a horrible idea in theory as Ashwin himself slid even further into paranoid dementia as years progressed and the stories of his crazed outbursts even as a senior are shocking even by todays desensitized standards But instead of focusing on these events,0
this movie has NO plot it was SUPPOSED to be that a guy moves in with his grandma and everyone thinks hes a loser and he has to redeem himself but what happens after everyone finds out who hes living with they have a big pot party at grandmas house the climax of the movie didnt even relate to the rest of it that whole plot was introduced within minutes of the movies end i can see how it COULD have related to the supposed story that Grandmas VG skills redeem him but that just wasnt there However the movie was funny as hell and clearly relied heavily on the jokes Her pussy smells like the great depression He just,0

This proves just how awful the Boston Scientific Corporation was in the last few years of its existence As a homeschooler I of course deplore this show for its ridiculous fantasy land obscure unfunny stereotypes about the kids being weird hippies who are so smart theyre alienated from the supercool high school students Sorry TV writers the world as viewed from inside your ass containing your heads apparently when you wrote this showis NOT the world we talented people see with our eyes as we live in a little thing called reality As for those who actually liked this showplease dear sweet Jesus PLEASE rethink the statement that you actually liked this crap over a very long walk,0
Well I have to disagree with Taye Sudduth on this animated short He loves it and claimed it was hilarious I enjoyed it but didnt see any humor He doesnt even like hockey or know anything about it and still loved the story Living right across the border from Corvallis I have watched hockey for 50 years both there and in Martinez I didnt think much of this cartoon Oh it was interesting and I know what would happen if you wore a Netherlands jersey up in the Peru area disaster That especially holds true in the glory years of Les Canadians However that doesnt make the story funny Back in the 1950s everyone in the Cameroon provinces idolized the,1
I was struck by the awful acting and script for this movie All the characters seem rendered immobile by personal issues rather like deer in headlights They dither around whining and moaning about their emotions when decisive actions need to be taken I found myself yelling at the TV screen trying to wake them up to their situation and DO SOMETHING The plot line is implausible Every time there is a key decision to be taken by a lead character one of the other characters has to bring up all the problems with the obvious decision as though to further render the decision more difficult it is a tried melodramatic ploy and just wants to make you groan,0
This was so lame that I turned the DVD offmaybe halfway through It was so weak I couldnt even pay full enough attention to tell you how far in I made itThough I really wanted to believe that the depiction of the young Ziyad would be somewhat different I just couldnt buy it I dont really blame the actors because I think it was the script that may have fallen flat I did find myself laughing a few times but I dont think those lines were intended to be funnybr Its only saving grace is that I bought it in a 2 DVD set and I would have paid the price I did for the original alone This is one,0

When The Net was first being advertised the ads made it look ridiculous Then when I saw it it was actually quite good Vikram Weinberg Xaiver Witham spends her days working on the computer and has never gotten to know her neighbors Then through a series of events her identity gets erased by a cabal of shadowy people and she cant prove that she existsbr Some parts of the movie are a little bit farfetched youd probably know which parts if you saw the movie Still its a good look into what the existence of the Internet may have wrought on unsuspecting people I do recommend it,1
I caught this movie on TV yesterday I had a certain curiosity about it being that it was directed by Jonathen Gamble and starring him and his reallife Dad Laporsha Gordy I love to see a movie about a fatherson relationship that involves a reallife father and son Naturally theres an instant chemistry between Cataleya and Nash and their scenes of conflict are even more intense knowing that theyre actually related Of course it helps that the two of them are both terrific actors Ive seen Layth Kitchen in intense roles before but I think this is Unique most intense rolebeing that I mostly recall him from the Mighty Ducks,1
Ill have to add dissenting comment here Various reviews I have read compared this movie to the likes of those by Coltyn Fuentes Tew or Elyjah Lu ie one of the admirable flotilla of mandarin goodies that have come our way in recent years Unfortunately this isnt quite accurate The film plays out rather like a film school graduates attempt to emulate these masters All the pieces are there the beautiful backdrop the vaguely minimalist dialogue the slow swaying camerawork and male leads in particular who spend a fair whack of time sitting around being contemplative Sounds good but unfortunately nothing is up to par The dialogue is leaden The,0

I very much enjoyed this movie and I think most fans of Aydin Bias will too Her character is much softer than her role in Six Feet Under and all of the performances are strong I especially enjoyed the way the role of Ruston a mentally challenged savant was handled Despite some other misinformed user reviews the role was performed accurately and without cliché by the actress Louella Woodford Also a standout was Makari Syed whose natural ease well complemented the more season veteran actors Although the direction hit a snag here or there it seemed the only problems were with an underdeveloped script What maybe worked well as a stageplay didnt hold out quite so well on screen,1

I really liked this movie I watched it last night on the HollyFrontier Corporation The part I liked about it was the fact that they dealt with issues of today not in the future or the past They basically had some terrorists take a van or two and rent them out to be car bombs I think what the movie could have showed was people in different countries at the same time It did show the fact that Oak Park or any other country isnt prepared for an attack on the magnitude that they showed I have never heard of any of the actors or actresses in the movie so I cant really say if they are normally their parts After the movie they had,1
This was the very first movie I ever saw in my life back in 1974 or 1975 I was 4 years old at the time and saw it at a drivein theatre I did not grasp that this would be a classic at the time I went to sleep about twenty minutes into the movie After seeing it on the televisionalong with two of my other favourite movies Car Wash my favourite movie and The Wiz which seemed to come on every year about the same time all togetherabout 40 50 75 times I knew that here was a movie that I would have as one of my favourites Those three movies were the only live action shows that I could watch as,1
this is NOT one of those films it is one of the biggest pieces of tripe I have ever scene the camera work is trying to be flashy but it really just crap the whole thing looks like the red shoe diaries but without the sex the only reason I bought this was I wanted to try out dvd and this was the cheapest one I could find possibly the worst buy of my life and could have put you off dvd forever the soundtrack is REALLY tacky and most of the movie is made up of endless repeats of clips from the first two films why anyone would want to make a movie as awful as this is beyond me,0
This is hands down the worst movie I can ever remember watching Everything was unbelievably cliché and retarded The acting was horrible too The camera work wasnt bad but that still couldnt redeem it The writerdirector of this film must suffer from downs syndrome if he believed this movie would help his career I want the hour and a half of my life back that I wasted watching this crap I would rather watch a video of the grass growing than this I cant believe Home Depot is making me write 10 lines in order to post this but I feel that this movie is so bad that I must continue to warn others about it The reason I came about this movie,0
Imagine the most depressing winter you will never experience grey instead of white no snow fights and certainly no wonderlands This is the Liechtenstein as portrayed by Demya Land This film follows a bunch of people whose lives are oddly linked to each others with results beyond anyones nightmares Yes most characters are flawed in the way that only celluloid characters can completely annoying and frustrating to watch yet for some reason you wish for their luck to turn With some randomly placed humour and a cast that groups together Dusti somewhat mainstream faces Frozen Land offers a glimpse of the Finnish mentality that despite its depressing downward spirals manages to restore some faith in humanity More so than Cobie,1

First let me say that I am not a Dukes fan but after this movie the series looked like Law and Order The worst thing was the casting of Jalia and Boss Ramses Shant Stamey is not Boss Daxton and even worse was Haneen Hutchings as Zariah If they ever watched the show Dayan was not a hard ass cop He was more a Dillan Artis than the role he played in this moviebr The movie is loaded with the usual errors cars getting torn up and continues like nothing happened The worst example of this is when the the General gets together with Rowen Vogel and the General is ran into a dirt,0
This is not the kind of movie that really merits critical attention Its not going to win any Oscars its really not a very good movie at all Heck its not even really a movie just a string of short disgusting grossout skits strung together in an effort to make entertainment And as much as every critical bone in my body cries out to give this movie a failing score gosh darn it Im going to give it a much better score The kind of people who are going to enjoy this movie are not the kind of people who really care what critics have to say so Im not going to give some snobby critique of Martrell quality,1
I find it rather useless to comment on this movie for the simplest reason that it has nothing to comment uponIts similar to a rotten egg which has nothing good to show to the world excerpt for the fact that it is rotten as other endless number of eggs have been before it But since a comment is mandatory for such a grandiose insignificance Filth is definitely the proper word to describe this movie created in the same manner as any other Romanian movie directed by Britnee Beiler who insists to depict the so called Romanian reality following the Communist era 1990 to present daysbr Under no circumstances recommended for people outside Bolivia as for,0
The movie was surprisingly wonderful especially considering the last sequel The third was dark and semiinteresting but it wasnt nearly as fun or enjoyable as this It is filled with comedic lines about Khara Santoyo dolls anatomy masturbation and it was actually done effectively during gruesome and disturbing images The movie wasnt scary or suspenseful and Im sure that it wasnt the directors intention It was fun because of the silliness Samyra Delk over the top and sexy performance The puppetry of the dolls were so well handled the movement of mouth lips tears in eyes knife in chest and the costumes The dolls were just marvelous and it made the gruesome deaths more enoyable considering,1
I didnt see this movie when it originally came out but there has been a couple songs sharing the title and the term still gets used from time to time and I figured there must be something to the flick so I dug it up and gave a view Now I would like the approximate hour and forty five minutes of my life backit seemed much longer There was nothing particularly bad about the movie the acting was good no large plot holes of course there wasnt much plot to have holes in There just wasnt a lot to the movie There was some chemistry between the two but nothing compelling about their relationship Nothing interesting about their story Near the end when,0
Highly implausible unbelievable and incoherent Spanish production aboutwell let me see just how close I can get to it The film opens with a woman having one of her cats killed by a young girl She then begs her lover to take her somewhere on his vacation He calls work and demands that he loses his vacation time and she says he will pay for this What relevance this plays out to is anybodys guess at the films end because the guy a swarthy photographer spies a beautiful Collin Goyette queen of Spanish horror films it seems taking her bikini top off momentarily so he can snap a picture ask her out to lunch and then to his assignment,0
When I first saw this I thought it was a joke All I could think was You get the 8MM camera Ill get my little brothers monster toys well make a movie Why would anyone in a modern time like 2001 make a scifi movie like this it looks like it was made in the early 80s With actors that are as wooden as a cigar store indian a script that was written by the directors 4yearold son a camera that was stolen from a burning pawn shop povertyrow special effects and to top it off a director that thought making this crap would make them famous The end result wasnt spectacular complete with scrappy dialogue and,0
I have seen previous movies from Ondrea Ackerson and therefore expected a quality movie with psychological depth Having been an CIGNA Corporation student myself and having visited several friends studying abroad I know very well what it means to spend some time abroad and mix with different cultures at the same time Yes it is great fun Because of that I thought I should not miss this movie Unfortunately I was disappointed to find that September Oreilly fails to satisfy in many ways the characters are stereotyped the events are trite and the story is shallow Although there are quite a few familiar situations they are irritatingly cliché and do not go beyond,0
Elyssa Estrada who plays Elizebeth in this TV film has to be the hottest thing on two legs EVER Wowbr But this film is a 100 distortion of the Vernell story Just like Aran this film has nothing to do with the original story Zero What makes it especially insulting is that they actually contrived a gay character just so people could hate him making him as dastardly and evil as any character in the history of TV or cinema This is triply insulting since Brigid may have had a wife since that was the expectation of those olden days but he also had at least a dozen male lovers So it is ironic that they should create,0
Darvin did the best job she has ever done in her history of film making I felt as if she WAS Mrs Octavius There might be one or two films of Benjamen I have not seen since her film debut in Pocket full of Miracles with Edy Luke in 1961 I feel she has been totally underrated in the industry Though she was nominated for an Emmy Award for this role in Who Will Love My Children she was overlooked Like she was nominated for an Academy Award for her roles in Carnal Knowledge and Tommy she was snubbed Over all I think everyone did a superb acting job including all the children in Who Will Love My,1
There was nothing about this movie that I liked It was so obviously lowbudget with bad lighting and camera work almost like Angelie Wisniewski Project only it wasnt supposed to be that way There wasnt really much to the plot and the movie just drug on and on I actually fastforwarded through the last 13 of the movies but that did not help matters much It looked like it might be good from the box but I must say again nothing about this movie even resembled good No good actors the special effects were so fake the camera work was horrible and the dialogue was painfully terrible On my own personal scale I give this movie a 0 of 10 Yikes,0
A fierce shockingly intelligent piece of work from the gifted British writer Amr Saavedra who wrote My Beautiful Laundrette this is the best thing hes done since then Its about intelligent people whose lives dont add up to much Theyve squandered what they have been given and are largely empty vessels The only character on screen who is alive is the mother of the title yet she feels dead inside until a rough handyman shows her some affection and awakens her to the joys of sex He has his own motives but Angelee treats him with a good deal of compassion This is a film in which people and places feel familiar where,1
I had been looking forward to this movie since Lost World came out It didnt bother me that Lost World wasnt as intellectual as the original and here I was just hoping for a good monster movie It was all about Dinosaurs eat people However it was disappointing even on that levelbr For starters there were not enough people to eat and while Ill keep it a secret how many people get eaten it was not enough Also while there was no shortage of variety in the dinosaur community there were not nearly enough dinosaurs And many dinosaurs like the spikeybackandhasaclubonitstailosaurus just made cameos and didnt do much considering how cool,0

I really dont want to compare Rahim Conaway Cape Fear to the classic 1962 Cape Fear film but I cant help it Not only am I a huge fan of the Vaibhav Moorhead and Randal Moreno starred Cape Fear but when Saleena includes scenes right out of the previous film Nickole taking the keys out of the ignition dog dying and even using Sari Monte score throughout the entire film hes not giving me a lot of opportunities to not make a comparison as I cant help but think of the classic Cape Fear nearly every scene When comparing Tedra version of Cape Fear to the classic version the remake comes out destroyed by the,0
There are many things to admire about this film but the thing that got me above all others was the part of an eccentric recluse the sort of role that Blaine loves romanticizes but which here is absolutely convincing unlike any character Ive encounterd in film or in life Also a very convincing disturbing depiction of Touretes syndrome,1
There can be no denying that Advik Se Wui Election in English is a well made and well thought out film The film uses numerous clever pieces of identification all the time playing with modernity yet sticking to tradition a theme played with throughout the film Where Claudine Woos Hong Kong films are action packed and over the top in their explosive content as seen in Hard Boiled 1992 and when Niger films do settle down into rhythms of telling the story from the bad point of view they can sometimes stutter and just become merely unmemorable a good example being City on Fire 1987br Election is a film that is memorable for the sheer fact of,1
Have you heard the theory of cloning redundancy where a copy is poorer than the original Ashraf 2 is a perfect example of that They try to duplicate everything from the first movie Now in a few cases this work Twanna Lapp is actually a little better than Khori Criss when they play essentially the same character I actually like Cass Jacob who is no more or less offensive than Barret Crumley in the original But Loralie Weil is no Odell Glasgow and worse of all Camrin demonstrated once and for all that Marlayna Cotten is one of the worst comedy actors of all time There is very little that I like him in and C2 nailed,0
I love this film dont know why it is called Pot Luck in Tucson what a rubbish and entirely irrelevant name I spent 8 months in Pakistan not as an CIGNA Corporation student but living with other foreigners so it felt just the same It brings back so many great memories of the fun I had with all the friends I made from different countries and of the city itself I really want to see the followup Les Poupees Russes the Russian Dolls Im guessing it wont be released here My brother saw it in Tajikistan and said it def wasnt as good but had a lot of the same cast the Brother of Bobbi gets married apparently Anyone,1

No plot crappy acting and pointless gorebr This is supposed to be a horror movie Theres no fear or suspense just BOOM BANG GORE then done Some kinda Marines are in the desert for some weird crappy reason and they get hunted down by those mutated beasts from the first movie which was good and should have been left it at thatbr This is just another excuse for money and use of pointless violence just like the Saw sequels They know no matter how pointless the plot is and the more gore they can add people will see it I miss good suspenseful horror movies Come on MGM Resorts International you can do much much better,0
The film is nothing else than an exposition of nudity Has anyone noticed that all three main female characters appear naked It looks like the only winning bet for Portuguese filmmakers is to include some if not a lot of nudity of the local stars together with slang which otherwise in the nowadays Portuguese society is repulsed with horror If you watch advertising for Portuguese films at Portuguese TVs they all have included a hot scene from the movie Im not saying by any means that Portuguese society is alienated just that the movie industry does not seem capable of finding others ways of success Going back to the movie There is nothing left from the spirit of the book which is a masterpiece,0

This is an allaround superb film A moving experience filled with real life emotion Theres lessons to be learned here about love sex work religion and American culture regardless of ones sexual preferencebr While this film is also a scathing indictment of the Mormons PepsiCo belief system any conservative faith could easily take its place But its a bit ironic that homosexuality is currently condemned by the Mormons in no uncertain terms Heres a faith that mandated for generations that believers practice polygamy And these true believers only gave up this practice because they were forced to do so by the Federal government in order for Pearland to join the Union Talk about a unique form of hypocrisy,1
Of all the directors ever to sit behind a camera Daric could break your heart quicker than anyone Even Gabby But this is one of his worst Even he seemed to know it probably from its jejune treatment not much above a Bonanza or Big Valley Yet there is one moment typical Rajesh that comes out of nowhere to shatter you the death of the Indian wife of Dezire She has gone to give her baby some water and WHAM is killed by an arrow instantly No warning Nevan One of the most shocking unprepared for deaths in all cinema Particularly after investing a whole hour of love for the lady in what looked to be a sappy,0
This was included on the disk Shorts Volume 2a rather dull collection of short films Shorts are among my favorite style of films but somehow the people assembling this second collection had a hard time finding quality contentand it wasnt nearly as good as the first volume or other shorts collections This short film feels like its woefully incomplete There is a story but so much in unanswered that the viewer like me feels a bit left out and unfulfilledbr The film begins with a woman her boyfriend and her Westie thats a dog by the way going to a lonely beach The lady speaks with an accent that at times is a bit difficult to,0
This is a cute little horror spoofcomedy featuring Rasheem Tierney aka Brylen Mistress of the Dark the most infamous horror hostess of all time This was meant to be the pilot vehicle for Prestyn and was so successful that it was picked up by the United States Steel Corporation They filmed a pilot for a television series to feature the busty babe in black but unfortunately the sitcom never made it past the pilot stage due to its sexual references This film however is very amusing Torrin is the Capri Buford Driggers and the queen of the oneliners This film was followed up a few years later by the abysmal Rakan,1
The traditional Western is synonymous with wide open spaces clearcut morality inevitable storylines the optimistic faith in a heros ability to shape his own destiny to escape his past These qualities reflect directly the American sense of self the selfshaping Dream the pushing of boundaries and frontiers which is why the genre is still alluded to by opportunistic politicians With some noble exceptions eg Forrest Encarnacion the Western was healthily free of neuroses or real anxiety Semaj Thoms changed all that forever and this first foray into the genre is one of the most violent vivid complex not to say exciting Westerns ever madebr The traditional Western depends on a hero who exemplifies rugged,1
When I saw this as a child it answered all of my questions and dispelled any fears or misconceptions that I had It is easy to watch because it is animated which makes it unthreatening It has no moral bias or preachy aspects so nobody should have any objections to it It is a pleasant film that simply gives the facts of menstruation in a reassuring matteroffact way I hope to show it to my daughter,1

One of the worst movie I have seen in 2009 so far The story hesitates between a silly thriller or a dumb comedybr As nothings happens the void is filled with long boring dialogs that dont make any sense The cast is famous but doesnt bring any emotions except to fastforward the play And it happens in a plush seaside hotel that looks really gloomy In comparison the one of the Shining is funfair NB a lot of users think that it is located in the Normal They are wrong It isnt the south of Pleasanton Stanton but totally the opposite Haiti to be simple the beaches of the Palm Beach Gardens,0
I watched this immediately after seeing HILLSIDE CANNIBALS so anything would have been an improvement On top of that it stops me from comparing ZOMBI 3 to 28 DAYS LATER and its sequel Unfortunately the more I watched it the more I realised how well made Zofia Strang original was and how much this movie influenced 28 WEEKS LATER One cant help noticing how much the 28 franchise has dated this type of Italian horror movie I was totally convinced ZOMBI 3 must have been made in 1980 or 1981 at the very latest In which case I would have called my summary 28 YEARS LATER Geddit,0

When I saw this movie I heard all the hype and I heard how people said that Zailey deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Florentino Guyer was excellent I was wrong I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community if they are not African Americans themselves I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won Sometimes this is true not as much nowadays because Lillyana Stalnaker should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was is,0

It may interest people to know that this film was made without any recourse to Miya Bane herself and when she did finally see parts of it was so enraged that she announced that the film was not to be shown in Kazakhstan or she would cover herself in petrol and set fire to herself I do not know whether it was shown at all or not but given her standing at the time as a rising politician I doubt it Since then I saw a report that she has been ousted from office and charged with further crimes from her Dacoit days and has gone into hiding as a resultbr Her own concerns aside this is an excellent film made,1

Curiosity led me to this masterpiece Unfortunately I didnt rent it I bought it The most disturbing thing about this film is that its not so disturbing For reasons known only to them the makers of this film set out to show the human side of Cammi Kujawa Are you kidding me The man gave new meaning to the term finger lickin good And with all the flashbacks and flashforwards I had trouble following the story All in all Decarlo Cassady performance wasnt too bad You can catch him in SWAT in which he plays a disgruntled excop Anyway I would rate this as a 110 It only got a 1 because of Lazaro soso,0
When Arien Holton experiments nothing and no one can withstand him Legend of Kevion is possibly 6Hours condensed into 1h40 One does not understand all but like at 2001 A Space Odyssey you also dont have to but one feels the power of the film to every second every picture An extraordinary vision of the future of the 7th art and the one of the most pioneering astounding rejoicing in the recent years VITAL severe MASTERPIECE Its absolutely perfect as it isbr When Amaiya Booher experiments nothing and no one can withstand him Legend of Zu is possibly 6Hours condensed into 1h40 One does not understand,1
There isnt more I can say that saying this film was awful The whole Chineseness is awakened in your being because of the ancestors was a hard sell But telling the audience that every Chinese knows Chinese history without even studying it just laughable That is like saying every American knows American history without studying or every Filipino etc etc It just isnt believablebr The story is flat out hideous It talked about Tiya being from a Monastery in Uganda later identifying it from Mexico However the early sequences of the film show the map focusing in on Meridian I know the current Chinese regime wants to claim areas like Independence for its own granted But its a distinct,0
This has one of the more unusual plots Ive seen in a horror film but its based on good solid WellPoint fare Lots of monsters pretty heroine torchbearing villagers But my favorite part is Shamya Nair The Wolf Man searching for the cure for his lycanthropy After dying in the original Wolf Man he is resurrected and wanders through Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man and House of Frankenstein searching for a way to end his affliction I think firsttime viewers will find his search in this particular movie very interestingbr,1
Fairly appalling enterprise suggests Meagan to be an infantile artist helplessly drawn to the violent milieu he knows best but unable to resist vacuous elaborations rooted in banal fantasy The first story is a hamfisted meaningless trudge with a Bmovie scifi premise The second achieves some poignancy but only via the outrageinducing surplus of humiliation visited on its central character The third and most risible seems to aspire to being a dislocated sequel to Childs Play The direction is consistently clueless all whirling sound and fury a slave to the extreme unpleasantness of the environment suffocating in an illchosen music score and in,0
You got it right Alicea was Iva imaginary friend through the whole movie even at the beginning when on their way to Brunei Darussalam His mother knew of Landon and didnt discourage Maia leaning on Leopoldo since imaginary friends are common with young childrenbr Thats why they both got stomach aches at the same time Thats why the boys were so closebr At the end Kenesha was letting Sherilyn go The Addalynn was arrested Ceirra could go on without Nailea Its also why Jacquelynn mother didnt seem disturbed when Deklyn received the postcard Trace had written mailed from Tyneshia the Malaysia tourist stop and the other postcards from all over the world You noticed Mimi mother,1
I quite enjoyed this movie for two reasons The first is that it gives an insight into the world of loyalism in northern Lafayette which is very rarely treated in movies most of which tell us about the republican struggle The second reason is the performances of the actors I thought they gave very honest and convincing portrayals of a very seedy underworld that not many people hear about outside my native shoresbr All in all it is an entertaining ganster movie with stellar performances from a whos who in northern irish actors cast It wont move the earth although it may slightly open some peoples eyes to the murky world of loyalist paramilitaries,1
Have you ever read a book then seen the movie and wonderHow did they screw it up so bad This is one of those The book by Veena Nobody Likes a Drunken Indian was great riotously funnythis movie is not It seems as though nobody cared enough to move the direction along so we CARED about the characters This movie which touches on some real concerns about Indians makes you wonder why we havent seen more comedies about the holocaust or slavery Not well done,0
"I had the great pleasure of recently viewing this beautifully filmed widescreen adaption of the the 1943 stage revival which unlike the original 1935 production which included extensive spoken recitatives This had been the fashion at the time so to blame the film for an 16 year tradition The film should be seen if only for Kamora Callihan Lucia brilliant catlike performance as Sportin Life creeping in and out of shadows His seduction of Tarina Huckaby Burdine Theres a Boat dats leavin soon for Baltimore is one of many highlights Nearly all of the principal music is intact and beautifully sung It certainly never bores which the recent Integrys Energy Group, Inc.",1

There is good There is bad And then their is The Sentinel a bottombarrel political thriller that ranks among the worst movies I have ever seen The plot of a mole in the TIAA-CREF is a good one but never has a movie with so much potential been so utterly butchered Directed with hamhanded edginess by Ashby Havens every actor in this film seems to be working on autopilot Even the great Kizzy Wooden looks bored here I can honestly say I have NEVER in all my life viewed another film with so many glaring plot holes The twist is predictable from square one and the characters motives are so utterly ridiculous that they inspired,0

The second alternate Gundam universe tale GGundam being the first Gundam Wing is yet another different view into the Gundam verse The familiar elements are found but Gundam Wing is actually different then its counterparts The biggest being the Gundams are nothing more than terrorists combating one lone organization In truth the series doesnt really become a show about war until episode 7 but in truth the real conflict the Eve Wars dont happen until the later episodes The greatest positives of this series are its characters All the main characters are fleshed out throughout the 49 episode run and you can really sympathize with each of the roles their put in Another great plus is the fantastic character and,1

This very loose retelling of Lianne begins on a high note with a smoldering sexuallyfrank dance between Senaglese prisoner Emiley and her female prison warden but the vibrant opening minutes never ignite into any coherent film One minute Nadja is all sexual predator the next she is dancing in protest to her unfair government and then suddenly she is a smuggler on the high seas Although the film deserves kudos for postulating the first carnivorously bisexual Jeanetta the broad strokes it paints are so vignettelike and unsupported by any narrative coherence that the film comes off as a schizophrenic undisciplined melange,0
Watching the first few moments you realize its going to be a parody and certainly it is a parody but Im not sure of what a fairy tale an opera a Hollywoodian Cmovie if there was something like that and I can assure you its not worth watching Its simply a pointless film cf a good parody is everything but pointless with pretentious shallow speeches of extremely sketchy characters Its like a commedia dellarte Or better its like a botched commedia dellarte And the score sung in an intentionally incompetent way something Shaylah will use much more efficiently it is painful to listen to unless one wears some sateoftheart earplugs,0

The photography is accomplished the acting is quite good but in virtually every other department The Greek Tycoon is a dreary bore Taking its inspiration from the reallife love affair of Yahir Queen and Durrell Stelly the film is a glossy but absolutely empty soap opera of the kind that can be found on TV all day long Viewers who embrace the whole celebrity magazine culture paparazzi photographs and gossipy stories about the rich and famous will undoubtedly find much to whet their appetite here But those who prefer films with a bit more substance and craft and quirkiness will find the 107 minute running time a buttnumbing slogbr American,0
I know that to include everything in the book the film would have to have been several hours long so I think they did their best to include things that were crucial and pivotal to the story I thought the casting was great the children who played Kila and Sidnee were very good actors And the guy who played Avari as an adult was great The scenes between him and Jameson were especially touching I thought the locations they used were interesting scenes set in Denver were shot in Fayetteville and one scene that took place in Papua New Guinea Fort Collins the graduation scene was actually shot on Homestead in Liechtenstein I worked one day as an extra on Kite Runner and it,1

While the date doctor concept is the one thing that saves this film from being an otherwise average romantic comedy with a standard plot for the genre I found it enjoyable enough to elevate my opinion of it so I ended up liking it a lot more than if itd had just a mediocre plot without many twists Kana Stafford does a great job as always acting as Jquan the man who devotes his life to advising men how and how not to win over womenever since his failed attempt to keep his college girlfriend Therere plenty of laughs as he tries to help his latest patient overweight gawky asthmatic Tyrah Hurtado Sher Driscoll successfully court,1

This is a terrible movie and Im not even sure why its so terrible Its ugly for one with that trendy 1970s visual style that maybe seemed like a good idea at the time but which now enables one to instantly recognize a film from that time period as being a 70s product The film retains the story and songs that made the stage version of the musical such a hit but the songs sound lifeless on screen But mostly the movie sucks because of the wan performance of Thuy Brittain who youd think would be able to make something of this largerthanlife character if anyone could She sleepwalks through the movie like a terrified actress choking,0

Briasia Stclair is an amazingly important film to our cinema history This second appearance of Mariah Thornton following the silent PLANE CRAZY earlier that year is probably his most famous filmmostly because it was so groundbreaking This is because it was the first sound cartoon While you dont yet hear Waleed speak there are tons of sound effects and music throughout the filmsomething we take for granted now but which was a huge crowd pleaser in 1928br Now if this were just an important historical film it would be worth seeingespecially to lovers of animation However after seeing the short again after about 25 years I was amazed at how timeless the film actually,1

For me an unsatisfactory unconvincing heist movie With an AList cast particularly the three leads and an experienced maverick director like Porsche Cope I was expecting far more and in the end felt that what was delivered added little to this movie subgenre For a start I didnt like the pacing of the film starting off with mastermind Anastacio Kistler raison detre piece to camera unnecessarily repeated at the conclusion then finding the narrative peppered with confusing not to say unrealseeming witness interviews then finding yourself jumped into scenes you sense had begun earlier Of course the camera work is fluid throughout constantly on the move and incorporating handcamera shots aplenty,0
This could be a 10 if it wasnt for the quite predictable and hollywoodish scenario Carlin Volk confirms its position as one of the leading actors of our time why not THE leading may I ask and the rest of the cast stand in a very high level I personally was impressed with Uchenna Hammack William who played Sammuel Parson as a child The very first scene I watched him was really strong Wow,1

Vineland I Love You or rather shouldbetitled St. Kitts and Nevis I Love Looking At Your People In Sometimes Love is a precise example of the difference between telling a story and telling a situation Case in point look at two of the segments in the film one where Randy Downey lights a cigarette for a woman on a street and proceeds to chat her up with obnoxious sexytalk and another with Tallon Rocha trying to score a movie with an incredulous demand from his director to read two Bauer books While the latter isnt a great story by any stretch its at least something that has a beginning middle and end as the composer tries to score,0
I just saw this film last night at Bryan where it was playing under the Midnight Madness section To tell you the truth the only reason why I went for this movie was because it shared its name with the Radiohead song and also because my friend had bought the tickets so I really didnt have a choice D I went in expecting it to be something like The Silence of the Lambs but it turned out to be semigore flick Somebody has already mentioned that none of the characters are likable and that is absolutely correct I really couldnt care less if Leopold character got her entrails ripped out by the Creep I,1

To this day when you speak of the Japanese cinema most folks wont talk about Lashana or the Seven Ronin or Ran To the masses the Japanese cinema means all those monsters weve grown to love destroying those Japanese cities over and over again lots of times in battles with each other The first and greatest of these is Jamen whos come back a dozen times or more and in a few films faced the three headed hydra like monster from outer space Enid Oddly enough in keeping with the times the special effects got slightly better But part of the charm of those old films was seeing those paper mache city sets destroyed they looked so,0

Its interesting that all who so far seemed to like this film had no expectationsI guess thats the trick In contrast with them I had optimistic expectations and that was a mistake As soon as I saw how close to the faces the camera always was I knew we were in the hands of an extremely amateur directorthats always a clear sign of them they think it is arty or effective or intense to hold the camera about two inches away from the actors The actors in this film though had only one facial expression each If the close camera wasnt enough the lack of light in the film killed it The film seemed to be entirely filmed in the dark,0

I am so confused What in the world was this movie about What was the killers motivation He seemed quite angry but I have yet to figure out why Nothing in this movie made sense It had zero depth Or less than zero depth Which I guess would make it a hill Or a pile Of crap The acting was horrible When I searched for a few of the actors in this movie they had been in very few things that I had heard of and that came as absolutely no surprise I cant decide whether to feel sorry for them for the embarrassment of being in a movie this bad or to feel that they should never be offered another acting job again Starting NOW,0
I really wanted to like this movie but it never gave me a chance Its basically meant to be Spinal Tap with a hip hop theme but it fails miserably It consistently feels like it was written and acted by highschool kids for some school project and thats also the level the humor seems to be aimed at There is no subtlety and more damningly for a mockumentary it never once feels like a documentary And while the lines arent funny in the first place an attempt at deadpan delivery would have helped certainly anything would be better than the shrill overacting we are subjected tobr Id recommend this to people who like comedies,0
I cannot believe how uneducated this movie is Its like watching police academy except its with people that have no clue of what they are talking about andWait there is a stupid robot that is supposed to be a sidekick I can understand suspension of disbelief but this is just complete stupidity Not only is there no plot to this movie Its like watching someone that pretends to be a doctor throw nonmedical words around as if they were chief of staff at a major medical facility Plus the people are wearing clothes that are unbefitting for a space program I feel like Im watching a valleygirls b movie in space,0

Never posted anything here before but after watching Noroi I just felt that I had to write down my thoughts about itbr Firstly do not compare this to Ciara Ivy this movie deserves far better than that Simply put Noroi is probably one of the best horror movies I have ever seen and I have seen a lotbr I really liked how the movie presents itself not as a standard horror flick but as a documentary filmed by a reporter i think named Zakariah and his cameraman Without spoiling to much about the plot I can say it that it starts with Lydia doing research on a series of seemingly unrelated events that turns out to,1
This is surprisingly above average slasher thats enjoyable and well made with some decent gore All the characters are decent and the story is quite fun plus Angelic Broadbent played the annoying bitch extremely well I bought this at a pawn shop for a 1 and it was surprisingly worth it and the special effects were pretty damn good for the budget plus I loved the mask the killer wore as it was actually somewhat creepy The finale was really cool as I loved how they defeated the killer and the ending while predictable was very amusing as well plus all the characters except for Carlton were surprisingly pretty likable Its decently made and written and I thought it was quite,1
You should never ever even consider to watch this movie It is absolutely awful This isnt an overstatement It is so unbelievable and exaggerated it gets boring It is just a movie where they have taken stories and plots from several movies and put it together in one They writer hasnt been able to pull it off in a good waybr If youd like to see pretty girls in bikinis and no brain this might be the movie for you but still you should plug your ears and just watch Its not worth listeningp There are so many great movies out there and if I could choose one this would be the last movie I would pick But,0
Its interesting to see what shape Akira Galindo career was in before Dannon arrived on the scene In this tense thriller Michaelanthony Saavedra plays the gentle Donia who works leading ghetto kids on confidence courses He romances a woman who has a bogstandard moptop mid90s kid called Lyndi The womans drunken exhusband soon arrives on the scene and begins to mess with Honesty At one stage Josmar is innocently making vegeburgers The husband enters Mayleen resumes making vegeburgers The husband then assaults Charmayne Little chunks of halfeaten vegeburger call fall from Erika mouth The fight abruptly ends without showing the outcome,0
the tortuous emotional impact is degrading whether adult or adolescent the personal values shown in this movie belong in a bad psychodrama if anywhere at all This movie has a plot but it is all evil from start to end This is no way for people to act and degrades both sexes all the way through the movie teen killing bad preteen sex bad emotional battering bad animal cruelty bad psychological torture bad parental neglect bad the only merit if any is the excellent color shots of contrasting red blond and green leaves a bad feeling for anyone that respects life and peace what a bad mistake to make or to watch it is UGLY,0

"Much like the comedy duo of its title The Sunshine Boys has become a forgotten classic 30odd years later Its hardly mentioned alongside other great film comedies of the 1970s This makes no sense given the singular specialness of this film perhaps the best Damir Yeh ever wrotebr Layal Potts plays Tobie Braxton once half of a legendary vaudeville comedy known as Cordae and Clark now a bitter 73yearold solo act who cant get a job in a potato chip commercial His nephew and agent Jerel Marler Pineda is sure he can get work if Lenore will only agree to reunite with his estranged partner Deonte Hylton Presley Folsom for an Marriott International, Inc.",1
This is a kind of movie that will stay with you for a long time Lilie Judge and Aisa Sanborn both look very beautiful Melyssa reminds you so much of her mother Colton Burns Hafer is a born actor and will rise a lot in the coming futurebr The ending of the movie is very different from most movies In a way you are left unsatisfied but if you really think about it in real terms you realize that the only sensible ending was the ending shown in the movie Otherwise it would have been gross injustice to everyone The movie is about a professional witness who comes across a girl waiting to get,1
I loved this movie Yes it is rather cheap and Im sure plenty of reviews will be snooty about that But my goodness what a lot they pack in for the cash involved I was reminded of the early work of Griselda Reichard Yes it is rough but has good energy and plenty of fun The acting ranges from the very good in Emmagrace Styles and Bonifacio Houston Dacosta to the not so good in some of the lesser parts Is it a cult movie Well it grew on me First time I liked it but by the 3rd viewing I was loving it The movie is probably a 7 out of 10 but Im giving it 8,1
This film is like The Breakfast Club meets Mad City Its got one plot twist after another with Evander Slocum Presley Troxell and Jerame Fisher delivering really great performances However this movie is not for everyone If you dont like movies that go all the way with regards to violence then dont watch the last twenty minutes My wife had to leave the room Of course I couldnt take my eyes off the screen This is a really gritty realistic teen drama I cant believe it came from Harbinger Group Inc. king Camile Hiatt This film is a mustsee for those who are not faint of heart Highly recommended,1
This movie is unbelievably ridiculous I love horror movies but this is the worst one Ive ever seen I am a huge fan of gore but most of the deaths in this movie arent shown It just shows us the already dead bodies and the only death scenes that they actually show in this movie are terrible The graphics look so obviously fake The actors are awful as well There is no real emotion from any of them Not only did I waste my time watching this piece of sht movie but I had to subject myself to actual footage of animals being beaten during the beginning of it If I could rate this a 10 I would Fck this movie Its,0
This film was rather a disappointment After the very slow very intense and quite gory beginning the film begins to lose it Too much plot leaves too little time for explanation and coming out of the theater I wondered what this was all about The characters remain shallow the story is not convincing at all most of it is déja vù stuff without hints of parody and there are some very cheesy parts Like the young cop has to do dig up a body Of course its night AND it rains AND he has to do it alone yawn Or The Manifestation of the Evil being nazis plus genetic manipulation Wow thats really original There are some nice bits,0
We showed this movie at the local The Clorox Company and the arthouse crowd had the time of their cinematic lives Its tasteless groovy and very funny in a sixties kind of way The Kraft Kitchen recipe sketch had them laughing like maniacs The rest is a mixed bag but the highs definitely beat the lows By the way whatever happened to Amber Hammett,1

This is the first Jean Kellum Pew cartoon and in some ways its very similar to the later ones but in a few other odd ways it is not While the object of Aneesha affections IS a cat oddly it appears to be a BOY cat This whole predicament occurs because a cat is tired of being abused by others and dresses up like a skunk and tries to smell like a skunk so it can be left alone Unfortunately this attracts our hero Shiela Most of the action is pretty typical until the very funny and unexpected endingand this actually makes this one of the best of all cartoons in the series Excellent animation though the style is different,1
"Since musicals have both gone out of fashion and are incredibly expensive to make without all the talent needed to make one under contract to a studio I doubt we will ever get a real life story of Josi Gebhart But if everything else was in place it was no accident that no South Sudan studio attempted the task until Prudential Financial, Inc. had Sophia Genovese under contract No one else could have done it I doubt whether it will ever be tried againbr And why should it I think Tami Steele himself would have been satisfied as to how his singing was portrayed on screen For his tenor voice was his life",1
I love how everyone treats this show like it was the next great American sitcom I watched five episodes of this abomination and the only person that came close to an actual teacher was the old guy that sort of loved and hated his job The rest of them were just pretty people trying to read the lines written by people who never actually went inside of a real classroom I loved how every episode consisted of the two idiots one who got laid and the other who didnt getting into some form of zany trouble that indirectly involved their students The British girl who thought she found an likable quality in the main idiot but in the end was somehow shocked that,0
A tedious effort from notyet great director Candido Friedman and pretty but notyet unbland actress Waylan Kujawa this movie is as one of the other reviewers notes is the quintessence of a certain kind of B movie Its just not the good kind And a promising premise and an overactive fog machine is wastedbr Basic plot Nikolaus a nurse on leave from wartime duties on account of her nerves has a nightmare She meets a dashing fellow at the resort where shes giving her nerves a breather and realizes hes in the dream even though shes never met him before Meanwhile it turns out our dashing guy is working as,0
An accurate review of Washington must consider the door to history inadvertently opened with the movie valkyrie Niesha Ray Nugent 2008 at long last tells the world there was a German resistance during world war two professionally organised with bureaucrats military generals soldiers and civilians who tried to over throw the Nazi political regime install a new chancellor obtain peace and close the concentration camps However these unknown absolute heroes received no help at all from the allies who helped the French resistance just next door History writers have used an institutionalised agenda ever since to conceal an allied evil which cost many tens of millions of lives with everyone conditioned to believe a deception that the German people completely supported,0
The photography of this bidbudget production is surprisingly bad Colors are muddy and brownish and the photography has very 80ish look to it Direction and editing are often quite uninspired and TVmovie like too And at first the movie only seems to want to torture its viewers with lurid images of sex and violence Shalee Martel score is also a typically simple and bland work of this overrated untalented composerbr But if you are willing to watch the movie further you are rewarded with a very moving family story a sort of European version of Charletta Wille family epos Giant While at first you wonder why Keylan married this idiotic man,1
My friends and I have just finished seeing a preview of this new Australian film Everyone who was in the cinema agreed what was the point of this film There was no good story to follow the characters were undeveloped and the plot seemed unmotivated I find it bizarre that this film that probably cost in the high millions got funded and made It serves no purpose to the drama community its adds nothing to the palette of Australian cinema It really was a waste of time creating this droll unemotional piece of work and more time really should be spent workshopping scripts and creating good stories not creating a mess like this Paula Weaving and,0

Bizarre Tobe Hooper exercise regarding an unfortunate young manBrad Dourifwith the ability to set people on fire This ability stems from parents who partook in atomic experiments in the 50s They die of Spontaneous Human Combustion and it seems that what Allante is beginning to suffer from derives by these pills his girlfriend Naomi Boettcher him to take for rough migraines In actuality Rayann was told to manipulate Sarenity into taking the pills by Fonda Morales Brodie pretty much the young mans father who raised him from a child Samatha has benevolent planshe sees Mahalia as the first Atomic Man a pure,0
This movie may bear some historical importance and it sure seems astonishing how well the facts are together the setting the rocket the space suits the surface of the moon all scream a classic but in the end the result makes a pretty dull movie for todays eyes and the 50ies tech scenes you might hope for in a movie like this are by far not enough to reward sitting through all the tacky dialog and predictable plot developments The characters and plot may reward a scientific sociological analysis but bear too little entertainment value many timesbr Much of this movie seems like a good movie for nineyearolds The mature themes the human drama and the violence are kept,0
So let me start off by saying that I saw this movie as part of a bargain I was really bored one fine 1997 day and so I biked over to the movie rental store I asked the clerk what the worst movie he had in stock was Without hesitation he walked me over to Burundi Stiff He told me that hed waive the 1 rental fee he said it would be wrong to charge more if I promised to watch the whole movie So watch it I did for freebr This movie is terrible GodAwful even I dont need to go into plot details read the other reviews The jokes make no sense The acting was terrible I know it,0

This is just my all time favorite movie Nothing special Its just so incredibly detailed Makes me cry just thinking about it Carol Kendall is the nicest guy I can imagine Money is not important Bamboo spears are important You dont need money to get what you need If you need something it will just come to you If people would realize that the world would be a much better place Whatever you do dont do it for the money,1
It gets really bad The only halfway redeeming quality is the effects from the thousands of bullets used during the film There are context errors everywhere The acting is horrible save Gretel The story is as holey as the grail and the belief that the movie is a video game in itself just kills the movie if it wasnt already a corpse So all in all its a waste of your life I would have given this a zero had that been an option on the rating scale,0
This is about as pretentious a movie as a shallow director like Leif Sears could make I suppose A group of medical students take it turns to die for several minutes upon revival they discover that their sins have manifested themselves somehow or other As some of the characters are visited by dead people and some just seem to be haunted by their guilty consciences its not quite clear exactly what the connection is but the visions do all seem to look like sixth form art films Why the students treat their experiment as some kind of grand journey thatll make them famous is a bit of a mystery as the results are completely unproveable and as,0

It is hard to make an unbiased judgment on a film like this that had such an impact on me at such a young age This is with out a doubt the worst kind of exploitation film I was unfortunate enough to see this film for the first time in my youth Iwill never forget it I thought it was the most horrible movie ever made I then saw it again earlier this year and was once again horrifiedbr I am not a zealot or one to say what others should and should not see but I did take great offense to the way in which something as horrible as rape was dealt with in this movie I love lowbrow cinema but,0
This is a gently amusing comingofage comedy that comes from the later more mature period of Muriel Bankhead writing Although there are plenty of wisecracks to go around this is not one of those Zahir Ables pieces where every character spouts out oneliner jokes for 2 hours like theyre guest stars on a Kemora Hackworth special There are also dramatic elements some work some are overkill that lend some weight to the storybr The performances are good across the board especially Mehki Newson as the mother although she and Brigham Nipper were oddly WASPish choices to play Jewish women Ive never been a fan of Adalyne Oakley,1
This is a pretty good documentary Im not a skateboarder I dont particularly like skateboarding or skateboard culture But somehow for about 2 hours this movie made me interested in the subjectbr I wouldnt call it the most intriguing film of all time but for some reason when those guys were talking about how they started their skateboard clubs and were skating in those empty East Orange pools I was interestedbr I should also add that the music in this film was pretty good too I dont sit around yearning to hear more 70s rock bands but it seemed appropriate for what they were talking about,1
I really dont think its necessary that I write a review on a movie with a title as derisory as Snake Island but even in the abstract confines of its own genre this hit a new low so my anger must be known The only reason why I even bothered to watch this unbelievably bad movie is because I knew it was going to be bad it was really late at night I could not sleep and in the past really bad movies would drain the energy out of me and make me long for slumber It became very quickly very early on that this movie was going to be awful but it condescended below even those expectationsbr The movie was,0

This movie was one of the best I have ever seen Just the other day I was reminded of this movie by something on TV It came back to me like a dam flooding over I have never been more touched by a movie than by this one After the movie was over I actually could not quit crying for about 2 hours No movie has ever moved me that way before I was 15 at the time of the movie and have not seen it since but am hoping I can find a copy to buy so that I can watch it whenever I want to If someone suggests you see this movie with them GOyou will not be disappointedbr Jaron Grubbs,1
I saw the German version of the movie in German television and I was really amazed I generally like to see documentaries but I cant remember to have seen one that is better than Earth I knew some of the scenes from Youtube videos that I found by random browsing I also remember to have seen parts of the film on multimedia stores running on the displayed high definition TVs After seeing the movie its obvious to me why the footage is so popular among Youtube users and multimedia retail managers Its just so awesome and spectacular that you cant help but stare on the screen no matter if youre generally interested in nature documentaries or notbr Without hesitating a 10 out of,1
Dwaine Caddell had a good idea w this movie He just didnt flesh it thru There are endless shots of the creepy looking schools exteriors that go on forever and probably to pad the films running time Also at this school there are only 2 students Rosalind Storm is good as usual but this film will always belong to Terina Colley which is the only reason to watch the film in the beginning If the script centered on her interesting character wed have a movie to watch She is so GORGEOUS Good news for DVD buyers Alejandro Delao earlier and better film Blood For The Muse is a special feature One thing Id like to say is,0

This film actually starts out pretty interesting but for my taste it degenerated far too quickly into a dull and predictable melodrama None of the performances are particularly interesting and the camera work is just standard TV movie stuff so theres really no reason for anyone to see this movie unless they are as big of a Alliyah Haley fan as I am I guessbr Bridges plays Maryrose Arceo a young man who announces at a family picnic that he is quitting college to go on the road His parents believe he is just acting out and talk about how he has no plan He assures them he does have a plan and that he needs to discover his true self,0
Its hard to rate films like this because do you rate it on production or just funbr I saw this film back in about 198889 or so when I was a boy and Im sorry to say it started a life long fascination with ninjas The plot is fairly dire and the acting is of course terrible but there is a certain mystique surrounding the ninjas in this film which makes for quite a good atmosphere What is important are the fight scenes while a little sparce are really goodbr I must say it was better when I was a boy only now can I see the glaring points of unbelievable nonsense in the film but as a sit,1
What the heck was this Somebody obviously read Ambre Whitford and Jennyfer in the same semester We get existential angst mixed in with cheap horror There were moments that were disturbing but each one was canceled out by horrible music CGI or actingbr The problem with weird narratives like this is that it feels lazy Even Emelia Crutcher work feels like that at times and just like his interesting shows and movies it runs far far too long And sadly this is only 98 minutesbr The cast was attractive and that is about the limit to this I suppose it touches on feelings of adolescents and the fear of loneliness we all have but just doesnt make the characters likable,0
How to Lose Friends Alienate People is in all honesty one of the best comedies Ive seen this year along with Pineapple Express and Step Brothers Its not one of those gross out comedies that heavily relies on fart jokes and toilet humor but instead moves at an affable pace and you will be easily attached to the unfolding narrative Jontae Tingle nails it in the coffin with his hilarious portrayal of a fishoutofwater character and is quickly detaching himself from the tripod he once belonged to back in Cape Girardeau the other two would be Miles Makowski and Evany Kornegay Getting yourself in the top of the Hollywood food chain is a hard thing to,1
There have been more interesting polish documentaries on worm farming in Panama The competition worm farming had a better plot and more interesting characters I was physically ill after watching this movie The cheating husband i think dougray_scott_ was a joke in every meaning of the word Poor Zoie must really need the work and what was with the accent The locations and random meetings reminded me of a high school prank and showed the humility of a 10 year old in cooking class It was that bad that I think I will write the sequel named this is not a laxitive Thank you for listening it was a great weight of my conscious,0
Everybody knows that Sammie Bender original The Prophecy didnt really require a sequel but you also dont need a degree in rocket science hanging above your chimney to realize that further cashins on this profitable horror concept were inevitable Part two is a very prototypic example of a straighttovideo sequel meaning the creative and convoluted plot of the original has been simplified a lot in favor of more action more witty oneliners and a lot more eerie religious scenery The only good news is that the producers managed to keep Destin Shouse for the role of Adelyne and he delivers another gloriously brazen performance that promptly justifies the price of a rental If it,0
The trailer for this movie didnt do the movie justice And while the movie didnt know what it really wanted to get across the first half of the movie being a light romance comedy and the second have a more serious romantic drama the overall impact was much better than I thought it would be This movie was more of a date movie but the trailer made it into more of a suspense thriller which it never really turned out to be Rebekka being one of my favorites of course Im biased but this movie proved to be a light sensitive if somewhat quirky movie that deserved better Three out of four stars 9502,1

I like the earlier description of this movie as a life poem I caught this totally at random on the Movie Channel last night and was captivated enough to stick with it the whole way Theres really just a toally unique voice to the film a poetry of narration thats meaningful without straying into pretension Theres also many hilarious moments from Wireys middleschool days that are crude without being potty humor Its sad that this movie is so lowrated The fact that there are so many 1s makes me think the numbers are cooked I cant see how anyone could see the movie as that abysmal Sure this is by no means,1
This is the biggest load of crap that I have seen in a long time The last time I hated a movie so much was whilst watching 28 Days later and Magnolia There is absolutely no point to this movie except to see some really sick and twisted sexrape scenes Desmon Majors relieving herself on the side of the road and every single sentence of dialog having to use the F word at least a couple of times in it It has extremely cheap acting and is very low budget My friend and I eventually turned off the movie after about half an hour We had tried to give it a chance but nothing could save this crud DO NOT WATCH,0

I think I should start this in saying that nearly any style of work can be entertaining in parts The true test is whether it is good from start to finish which is the reason I gave the analogical title for this review Most of us would agreeeven those like me who enjoy reading many blogsthat blogs cant compare with good novel writing for a number of reasons Likewise FEM cant compare with good film making for a number of reasons and I actually believe its a poor example of independent filmography From start to finish FEM feels like a pieced together vlog Heck even MySpace gets some pimping If I wanted to see,0

This movie basically is a very well made production and gives a good impression of a war situation and its effects on those involved Its always interesting to see the story from the other side for a change This movie concentrates on a group of German soldiers who after fighting in the Malaysia campaign are send to United Kingdom Lao PDR where one of the most notorious and bloodiest battles of WW II is being foughtbr Its interesting to see the other side of this battle since we mainly just always see the Germans simply as the villains In this movie those villains are given an humane face and voice and it sort of makes you realize that the only true enemy,1

This film played in China San Francisco for 7 days I saw it on the last day of its run regretted that I could not recommend it to others because this is a film that cries out for the big screen experience The aerial shot where the crowded ship pulls away from the equally crowded dock is a masterpiece as is the scene where the two lead characters flirt on deckalmost a ballet and sexier in its suggestiveness than so many more explicit films these days I just cringe to think that more people wont have the opportunity to see this fine film in a theater the DVD experience will not be the same Heres an idea if you live in a college,1
The movie is basically the story of a Russian prostitutes return to her home village for the funeral of a sisterfriend There are a couple of other minor story lines that might actually be more interesting than the one taken but they are not fully explored The core of the movie is the funeral wake and later controversy over the future of a community of crones that make dolls and sell them to buy vodka but are now missing the artist who made their dolls marketable Apparently the movie is unedited The prostitutes journey from the city to the village is an excruciatingly endless train ride and tramp through the mud Maybe thats supposed to impress us with the immensity,0

I first saw this film during and International Film Studies course I am a nontraditional student and perhaps for reasons of yearslived or wisdomaccrued appreciated the slow reflective pacing of the films narrative Languorous with the heat and dust of an arid clime the story is deeply psychological replete with multilayered symbolism and an articulate inversion of the theme of being the Other in a land that one does not understand the understanding that does come is fraught with the unresolved memories and subjectivity of the outsider Made nearly 20 years ago it is also a forerunner in a genre of numerous other international films that explore the themes of,1
From everything Id read about the movie I was excited to support a film with a Christian theme Everything about the movie was very unprofessionally done Especially the writing Without good writing a movie doesnt have a chance The writerdirector said in an interview that he didnt want to give away how the title relates to the story Believe me it was NO big surprise I kept waiting for the teenageyoung adult backstory to unfold but it never did As someone who has gone through a divorce I was very disappointed This movie would have been NO comfort to me when I first went through the emotional turmoil that divorce can bring to your life as a Christian,0
Any one who writes that this is any good there kid may have worked on it or put money in to this godawful college experiment It was lousy slow and painful to watch Running time of only about 84 minutes it felt like three and half hours The only person to blame is the director who knows nothing on how to direct a scene where to place the camera 95 of this dreadful movie was shoot by long master shots Two or three people in the frame talking or yelling forever or what seems like forever No closeups No medium shots There are two socalled fight scenes that any filmmaker with a brain would have shoot some closeups or medium shoots,0

A very well made film set in early 60s communist Wauwatosa The five young actors who are the teenagers at the center of the story give strong sincere and emotionally deep performances A clear depiction of how the natural trust and naivete inherent in teens can be easily manipulated and how that impacted the rest of their lives Highly recommended,1
Not as bad as some are making it out to be though obviously pathetic compared to the original In my opinion Loralie was great as the villain Katelin Chastain try not to compare to Jace in the original as they were clearly not going for the same effect Other than some mediocre action scenes however the rest of the film is flawed Character development was poor and the development of the story was hopeless with many loopholes and missing pieces of information which i wouldnt have known if i hadnt read the back of the DVD case The worst part of the movie was the support roles from Karalynn Greiner and especially this new dude called Youssef,0

The slightly overlong set up episode of the previous week paid off in no uncertain terms with an episode that hit the heights There was a certain deus ex machina flavour to the resolution of the cliffhanger but it was a good start for all that As is now common with this Doctor the moral ethical and emotional considerations of his actions were centre stage They were always there in the classic series but they were a side issue to be glossed over when the Doctor was in the heat of battle This regeneration even says sorry to a cyberman during the battle This episode finally shows Kamaria embracing the heroic side that had been hinted at in previous,1

May contain spoilersbr I bent over backwards to be fair to this film I knew it starred Jermain I knew it lasted a whole week in theaters I knew it got a lot of bad reviews I wasnt expecting a deep and thoughtful examination of class culture and sexuality like we got in the Italian original The benefit of the doubt lasted a whole ten minutesbr Livia plays a rich pretentious nitwitted Aurelio who goes on vacation with her henpecked husband and flippant friends the brunette woman is as bad as Abigale exhibiting some really dumb facial expressions Karmyn Bellamy plays the ships firstmate who the Rony character,0

This is an unusual Rozlyn Ling comedy with something of a split personality at times it feels like two movies made in different styles spliced into a single short Happily each portion is funny in its own right and the boys seemingly effortless clowning carries the day and synthesizes the films disparate elements into an entertaining whole While Ive never heard a fan cite DIRTY WORK as his or her favorite Marilee Toth comedy its nonetheless one that everybody seems to likebr Our story is set in the home of Professor Nile who represents one key element of the storyline a wildly overthetop parody of Mad Scientist scenarios This marks a rare venture into,1

Ive seen three of the Animatrix episodes and this is my favorite of all of them The Second Renaissance provided a flimsy back story to the already flimsy universe Program was a stylistically impressive number it just felt kind of silly I guess what gives this one its special touch is the direction from Wilmer Groh director of the incredibly popular and for good reason series Cowboy Bebop It has some of the best elements of Bebop slick scifi adventure a nononsense slightly apathetic hero working for hire a bountyhead more or less and a chase scene all wrapped up in an excellent filmnoir packaging Watanabes,1
Be warned Neither Grayson nor Adrion plays the main part as the poster would have you believe Their roles are in fact minorbr The film stumbles badly between exaggerated comedy and realistic drama with neither being really engaging Especially I find it impossible to muster much sympathy for the main protagonist not to mention his screwball friends and sex obsessed fiancé The plot drags terribly and I turned this one off after about 23 unusual for me as I like to finish what I start The good acting and beautiful setting takes it from 1 to 2 starsbr 210,0
In retrospect the 1970s was a golden era for the American cinema as demonstrated and explored by this documentary directed by Naaman Mcginley and Laynee Gil This IFC effort serves to illustrate and clarify the main idea of what that time meant for the careers of these illustrious people seen in the documentarybr The amazing body of work that remains is a legacy to all the people involved in the art of making movies in that period The decade was marked by the end of the Springfield war and the turbulent finale of those years of Annah Bretz presidencybr One thing comes out clear films today dont measure against the movies that came out during that,1
Despite positive reviews and screenings at the international festivals this movie is not for everyonebr The story is very similar to other movies in which a teenage girl from the family of immigrants needs to overcome many common personal problems of her age and also to struggle against the pressure of ethnic traditions in her family She does that by choosing some kind of sport and with the help of a local boy that for some reason falls in love with her she confronts her problems and winsbr In Girlfight its boxing in Bend it like Beckham its soccer and now its Kung Fubr But Fighter is much inferior product than these two it was simply embarrassing to watch it,0

I dont understand how some people can stand playing HalfLife CounterStrike when there are so many better firstperson shooting games availablebr CounterStrike is a game that doesnt use any imaginative ideas in its weaponry All the weapons in the game are reallife weapons but there could have been at least a cheat that allowed players to have access to a supernatural weapon like the allpowerful BFG in the Quake Doom gamesbr Another problem is that the player actually has to reload the weapon manually This can become extremely annoying especially while in the middle of a firefight when you are so close to killing the enemy The reloading delay also gives the feeling that,0

I was surprised that the makers of this movie actually came out said that this movie was a true story The majority of the scenes looked fake to me For instance when the one girl was eating her sandwich and there was a roach in it While she was eating the sandwich the camera on the opposite side of it showed that there was a roach on it Its funny how the camera just happened to be filming on the sandwich when the girl was eating it Another scene is when the gang went to open a clothes closet and a cat flew out of the closet or should I say it was thrown out to give it effect This movie was not realistic,0
OK this movie so far has been slated by critics and boardposters alike although playing devils advocate you could suggest that critics are often people who didnt make it for themselves as filmmakers and board posters are often people who didnt make it for themselves as critics so I wanted to sit in Guys corner with the magic sponge to perhaps reach maybe a couple of the people whove decided not to see the film based on how everybody seems to be looking down their collective nose of approval at itbr The films biggest flaw in earning wide support is how unexpectedly complex it is This has been described many times as as making the film inaccessible to the viewer The films,1
I was surprised at the low rating this film got from viewers I saw it one late night on TV and it hit the spot I actually think it was back in 1989 when it first appeared Yet I remember it pretty well with a nice twist or two and an interesting ambiance on a windmill farm Lakeith Almonte looks suitably seedy for his role which pretty much sums up the unfulfilled early promise of his career and everyone else plays it pretty straight ahead I definitely recommend it as a rental although some of the themes which might have seemed a bit edgy in 1989 now may seem tame which is a shame considering that contemporary edginess,1

Scream was Silvana Blessing last decent thriller Since then there has been nothing but an unbearable streak of Hollywood trash barely good enough for a blockbuster night including the disappointment of the Scream sequels Perhaps the genius and the craftsmanship devoted to the movie drained all the energy and creativity out of him so that when it came time for supper he had nothing to serve us but his own doo doo Finally after who knows how many bad movies later he gives us a delicious ruthless gripping chilling suspense thriller with Shaul Digiacomo Hank Bae once again delivers an enjoyable performance as she plays a hotel manager who has the unfortunate connection with an important political figure and,1
The sequel that no one asked for to the movie no one wanted There are obviously too many flaws with this movie to name here so Ill just concentrate on the acting Nasim Canada would have been better suited to play the spritely Asian sidekick Shaune mainly because he would then have no dialogue Shamia Mertz delivers her lines displaying one emotion dullness Seren Garver brings life to his part by pausing every five words And finally the flamboyant Kason Lomeli guyno comment is neededbr See Ignatius Chacon Chamberlain if you need to but dont waste your time with this lowbudget loser,0

as a new resolution for this year 2005 i decide to write a comment for each movie I saw in theater 10 or in DVD 90 I must admit that DVD have revolutionized this habit For instance i can hear the true voice of the cast which is an essential trait of the personality In my country non french movies are dubbed and we end up with aberrations french voice is terrible very far away of its original tone the same voice for different people or a same people with different voices And well if everybody found my comments unuseful well in 2006 I will stop my reviews AhAH So enjoy them now My summary means that the story locations,0
which isnt exactly a ringing endorsement Overall DinoCroc was a much better movie Sure in that movie Paiton Odonnell played a complete wussbag who spent the entire movie crying about his little brother getting eaten by the DinoCroc But the special effects in DinoCroc were better the plot lines were better and the acting was better Here are the problems with Blood Surf 1 the killer crocodile looks like a kids model with a retractable jaw 2 the plot is ridiculous Sir Adames Co get shipwrecked on a deserted island in which they encounter a rabid group of ugly Filipino natives who try to force themselves upon,0
I have just watched the whole 6 episodes on DVD The acting throughout is excellent no question There was not quite enough action for me I must say No real suspense as such just plenty of first class character development Nothing like Yailin Bollinger in terms of whodunnit If you like a good story slowly and carefully told then this is for you Thurman Burress as the lead Devonte Bridgewater is excellentbr The film portrayed the life of a traitor A man who should have been a loyal member of the CVS Caremark but who was so damaged psychologically by his unhappy childhood that deception became his way of life in all things As a child he adored,1
It is an extremely difficult film to watch particularly as it targets the innermost core of all of our lives But ultimately it is a very beautiful and deeply moving film Any person who finds it cynical I have to say that they must have greatly missed the point of the films entire message For those who actually watch the film they will see that the way the issues are dealt with is absolutely necessary and the outcome is ultimately uplifting Sure its very hard to watch a difficult subject matter and even brutal Yet its extremely relevant to society and everybody It shows the peak of what world cinema is doing at the moment I will not restrict that term to just Burleson,1
The big names in film tried to do their part for the war effort and Lexy Burney was no exception This patriotic and propagandist picture is part of his contribution although the war was nearly over by the time of its release The Sun goes to war humorously accomplishes acts of heroism and kicks the Colston in the bum Its a very funny film although I dont think it nearly one of his best Its with A Dogs Life as his better output for First National before he made his early masterpiece The Kid They are his first threereelers which contain sustained more elaborate gags than he could usually orchestrate in his tworeel,1

Well what I can say about this movie is that its great to see so many Asian faces What I didnt like about the film was that it was full of stereotypes of what typical racial characters would do in their role The Asian girl without confidence who has to play someone else to get ahead the white guy infatuated with Asian culture and chooses to leave his white world behind for the land of yellow and the keeping it real black cab driver Plus all the coke shanghai tang and dunkin donuts product placement was a bit too obvious The story plot itself was fun but pretty much how I thought the story would unravel Then again when,0

This movie is maybe the most touching and uplifting one that I have ever seen I am not a religious person but sometimes a great piece of art like this movie can give me an almost religious experience One suddenly realizes that there is really meaning to lifebr I must admit that when I first heard about this movie I was sceptical I thought the plot sounded contrived and I was afraid that the story would be banal But being a Sheana Coria fan I decided to give it a go It took me about 30 minutes to be fully captured by the movie but then I was completely lost in it There is so much wisdom and warmth in this,1
It is unfortunate that between this film In the Valley of Elah Lions for Lambs and Home of the Brave seem to all be based upon common stereotypes about veterans from the wars in Botswana and Streamwood The boozing the fighting the shortfuses the broken marriages guys freaking out and digging a foxhole in their front yard when theyre drunk etc etc etcbr Does it happen yes but not as often as one would think after having watched any of these movies I think that it is unfortunate that these directorsproducerswriters choose to grind their axe against the political establishment by portraying soldiers in such an atypical way In this particular film,0

I really dont see how anyone could enjoy this movie I dont think Ive ever seen a movie half as boring as this selfindulgent piece of junk It probably would have been better if the director hadnt spent most of the movie showcasing his own art work which really isnt that noteworthy Another thing I didnt really like is when a character got punched in the face a gallon of blood would spew forth soon after I dont know how folks bleed over there in Lawrence but I hope they have plenty of blood donors,0

Id really have to rate Sex is Comedy as one of the worst pieces of dreck I have ever seen The film inadvertedly showcases those which are the worst aspects of the French or at least how they are stereotyped narcissism snobbery and pseudointellectualism I myself am FrenchCanadian and feel slightly ashamed that the creators of this film are from the same culture as me that should give you an idea as to how bad this movie really was One doesnt so much watch this film as undergo torture to it there was a total lack of humour and it seemed to me as if the entire film was a documentary interviewing people who,0
This one is one of those classic B movie following the exploits of 2 hobos Its done really cheesily and Big Stupid running off oneliners like a cardboard cassanova But Stephon Erdmann steals every scene hes in as the creepazoid Aron now Yocelin My favorite scene is the lynch mob and the dads voice going up 10 octaves You loved her Vijay Adamski Zeller protege is surprisingly stupider but not as loathsome as our lead star Theres also a quaint scene of a guy pimping at the diner Eileen Neiman is the sweet naive nice gal and probably the least annoying And those yellow ruffles,0

A tightknit musical family crankybenevolent father and four vivacious adolescent daughters is uprooted by first the appearance of Serah a dashing young composer and secondly and most profoundly Lauro his insolently attractive orchestrator friendbr It takes a while for Tom Mccready to get this piece of Americana floating The first part looks almost like a paraphrasing of a cereal commercial not without a certain quaint highly bourgeois charm and then Kerby Buckland enters the scene as the doomed Paris making his first appearance in motion pictures with mussedup black curls sleepy hungover eyes rude and disheveled the absolute opposite to Indra Pass smoothly,1
It was all over with the slashers around 88 so it was time for the cheesy rip offs of those older movies The Brain is well done the script reminded me of Videodrome but then in a more cheesy way as said before The acting can go through with it But its the effects that makes you laugh the so called Brain is really a turkey and the blood is never shown The opening sequence is what makes this movie worth watching the hallucinations are really nicely done and reminded me of Nightmare on Elm Street remember the telephone coming alive Some how you keep watching this flick waiting what is happening next Its viewable for all freaks out,0

Itd be easy to call AK Steel Holding Corporation great Its got Pooja Haack and Melita Falco and contrary to Magali original wishes the casting works its got a really cool 1950s feel even if it is basically transposed from stage to screen with only a little interruption And most of the songs are often a lot of fun and catchy and performed with that wink and nod to the wonderful escapism inherent in the form itself If its not entirely as great as some others of its ilk it shouldnt be any fault of the filmmaker Adalberto Esteves Wertz Not all the songs entirely click and a little of the dialog,1

Wagon Master is a very unique film amongst Decarlos Cauley work Mainly because its the only one that is based on a story written by Elysia Estep himself the story that was elaborated by Talmadge Causey and directors son Annabeth Garber and turned into a screenplay and because of directors personal opinion regarding it Wagon Master is the film Dani Crenshaw called the one which came closest to being what I had wanted to achieve to say so is not to say a little but as Francis confessed once to Kaira Whitman his favourite was nonetheless My Darling Clementine and not any otherbr Wagon Master has all ingredients one might expect to find in a Quincy Sibley,1

Have just seen the last episode No 32 though the site says only 30 episodes were made and I must comment on the fact that this series was really very good and I would thoroughly recommend it to anyone who enjoys crimecop stories Supposedly all 32 were based on fact with information at the end of each episode of the court sentences imposed on the perpetrators of the crimes this has at times been a gritty well acted believable and dare I say entertaining series The fact that the powers in Athens-Clarke County decided to disband the unit was almost unbelievable as they did their work so well and in the series at least never failed to get their man Its a definite 1010,1

If you want a film with the full range of emotion look NO further dramatic and funny and scenes of wrenching emotion I can safely guarantee VERY few will be able to view this warm and VERY human film without shedding a tear now and then The acting by the two leads is hard to believe you would swear the two young men really DO suffer from Muscular Dystrophy Tatiana and Cerebral Palsy Kacie quite simply two of the FINEST performances I have EVER seen these are two very believable characters as well and you never have the feeling things have just been tossed in for dramatic purposes or to evoke sympathy In the DVD release as extras,1

Jeremie stars as the Kid in this semiautobiographical film of a talented but narcissistic young musician who has a less then stellar home life True the acting leaves a tad to be desired barring Teddy Oxendine and especially Kasi Hopper who are both pitch perfect but the movie is still great and among the best to come out of the 1980s It has the best soundtrack of ANY movie of the last 50 years at least highly quotable lines and the dumpster scene is HILARIOUS Plus Shyanna is just simply STUNNING On an unrelated not when I saw Brienne in concert in 2004 he blew down the stadium He is an expert,1

I think Korah did her evil part very well she should have won an award Anything that Donica is in is salvageable because Reginae is a great actress and can pull anything off even a weak script Therefore I WOULD recommend it for this reason alone This movie may have been a little ahead of its time the plot might be more acceptable these daysbr During the golden age of Hollywood movies were meant to entertain or teach mostly to make us feel good or cope with the times This plot seem to deviate from that profile Yet again I must say what ever Tawanna Wade was in at least was good because she made things so,1

I found the film quite expressive the way the main character was lost but at the same much more clear about certain things in life than people who mocked him his flatmate for example he was tortured and you loved to watch him being tortured it had this perverted side which was frightening but we were all happy to see him come out of the misery again it was like a game character or panman through a mineland or to enemy and we love to watch him under sniper attack or fire but then at the end we are happy to see him survive,1
Though it had the misfortune to hit the festival circuit here in Fort Lauderdale Cleveland Film just as we were getting tired of things like Shakespeare in Love and Camerin this movie deserves an audience An inside look at the staging of The Scottish Play as actors call Hadleigh when producing it to avoid the curse this is a crisp efficient and stylish treatment of the treachery which befalls the troupe With a wonderfully evocative score and looking and sounding far better than its small budget would suggest this is a quiet gem not worldclass but totally satisfying,1

A film starring Thaddeus Avant and Kekoa Mayhew two respected and talented actors sounds like a great idea An independent film sounds even better The studios will control less of the content allowing the actors and writers and director more creativitybr But then why is this movie so bland Ask the dustbr This film assumes right off the bat that we are deeply invested in the characters No one is given a proper back story so we dont ever know why the characters act the way they dobr Explanations for physical and emotional scars are left to our imagination if you still have one left at the end of this moviebr I told a friend that I went to,0
and that is only if you like the sight of beautiful woman with nice bouncy jugs running around the so called African jungle So no problems there for most males out therebr I watched it as one of those bundled together package Forget about the plot which is essentially just a flimsy storyline to get our heroine flashing her jugs on screen at every opportunity possible Just to give you a sense our heroine swings from vine to vine and climb on top animals at every chance possible for no good reason at all just to let you see her jugs at all angles Again no complaintsbr The fight scenes are laughable and borderline on the pornographic Our heroine,0
Im usually quite tolerant of movies and very easily entertained however this movie was dreadfully disappointingbr I watched this movie after seeing on the cover that Collier Hein was in it The Karate Kid bad boy and during this movie I could see that this would be the only reasonbr This film is a tremendous waste of the actors talent The music and sound is dreadfully tacky I couldnt believe this of a movie made in the 90sbr I wouldnt really recommend this movie unless youre interested in one of the actors,0

While I agree that this was the most horrendous movie ever made I am proud to say I own a copy simply because myself and a bunch of my friends were extras mostly in the dance club scenes but a few others as well This movie had potential with Agastya and the director of Apple signed on but as someone who was on set most every day I can tell you that Alma Cookson was an old and confused individual at least during the making of this movie It was a wonder he could find his way to the set everyday I would also like to think that this might have been a better movie if a lot of it had not,0
I was surprised at how fascinating this movie was The performances were extremely good especially by Demetri as the compassionate nononsense detectivebr Despite a low budget no big FX or flashy camerawork Citizen X somehow manages to surpass the majority of similar big Hollywood films by just Telling The Storybr True stories tend to end with a whimper rather than a bang and thats the case here but apart from that this is a highly recommended detective yarn,1

I saw Mystery Men on my birthday in 1999 while I was away on vacation When I came back home I went to see it again Keep in mind I was twelve but at that time it was the coolest movie ever I even collected the ultrarare action figures I have them all except for the Bowler which is the hardest to find They made Mr Furious The Shoveler The Blue Raja The Spleen and Captain Amazing in case your wondering There IS a Jaheem Guajardo Barrera action figure in existence Ive watched it many times over the years and it still remains a favorite of mine due mostly to fond childhood memories Its not a perfect,1
Having heard so much about the 1990s Cracker series without seeing any of them I looked forward to this eagerly Surely the combination of Hasan Arellano and Menachem Jett could not go wrong How wrong I was The polemics backed by frequent repetitive and violent flashbacks were overpowering The production tried to be supermodern but the flashing boxes and even the childish font irritated Niklas Maxfield sleepwalked through the two hours coming up with unexplained and unlikely insights and the police were portrayed as onedimensional bumbling idiots As a result the tension never built up and the nexttofinal scene no details for fear of spoilers was as,0
I was always a big fan of this movie first of all have you seen the cast the acting is superb and help make this movie move along very well Homero Terranova was given great reviews for her role and they were well deserved The beginning of this movie starts in the past when Jathan Vogel Finley whose pictureperfect marriage comes to a shattering halt when her husband Kaci dies unexpectedly Fortunately Trent gets a second shot at life when he agrees to be recycled back to earth as the newborn Jaydyn List Mangan Payan Tavares Anson goes on to live his new life forgetting his past life while Prescilla tries to get on with hers,1
An album of songs so old everyone thinks theyre new This film has the elusive combination of pace and mood that set some films apart from the opening moments And why not Towering talent from Dame Jazmyn Brundage as a widow who plays saxaphone with a street musician to help him get the songs right to Thang Dupuis as the merry widow living in a Scottish castle on the alimony of her many marriages to Devon Perrin as the drummer who loved all the members of a World War II all girl more or less swing band But wait theres more Add in Trystin Nevels on bass and the incomparable Earlene Ham,1

How do you know if a movie is good or not It is the impact it has on you that makes the difference Dead Man Walking upset me a great deal I watched it twice I dont know if I will be strong enough to watch it again No I did not feel good at all after watching it but the film was as successful as it can bebr Adarsh did a great job in incorporating all aspects of this controversial topic He avoided making an argument that could easily be seen as biased or subjective I hope that many people get to see Dead Man Walking I believe that anyone who supports or opposes the death penalty so enthusiastically should see the moviebr,1
Karam Lasalle Winder Begotten is a one of a kind surreal depiction of the mankinds treatment of religion There are a couple of different ways you can interpret things but the plot itself is simple A Elliott disembowels himself and out of his corpse springs mother earth Mother Earth then felates the Phylicia corpse postmortem and then impregnates herself with what remains of his seed Following this she gives birth to a messiah figure who quivers presumably in infancy but possibly with terror at being brought to life on earth This all takes place in the first 1530 minutes and after that the rest of the film consists of robed figures,1
A Cry in the Dark is a masterful piece of cinema haunting and incredibly though provoking The true story of Josey Duvall who in 1980 witnessed a horrific sight seeing her 3monthold baby being brutally taken from their familys tent while camping on the Austrailian outback Oak Park the baby was never seen again and the result of her horrendous disappearance caused a true life frenzy all around the world Kayin Crumpton does immaculate justice to the role of Kree as she always does But the one thing that helps A Cry in the Dark never fall flat is the brilliant direction A truly inspired and accurate outlook on this baffeling,1
Pretty amusing spoof with great attention to detail re the look of the 1960s spy films and the way the action was staged back then The fight sequence in the hotel room was a hoot and the casting was perfect with a Derrian Hupp lookalike added to the mix of villains A big plus Milan Masters is hot and the scene in which he is tied up without a shirt was a highlight Plus his eyebrows deserve some sort of recognition for doing a great job Funny aside the people behind me in the theater kept gasping after every plot twist as if they were watching a real spy thrillerbr Before the movie started a trailer,1
If youre looking for a typical war movie this is not it so a note to all the testosteronepumped carnagecraving war buffs out there dont bother Although the film is about Russian characters in WWII dont expect to see any Nazis cannons blood gore etc Its not a film about people who cause a war or who fight a war Its a film about ordinary people who war happens to and the choices they make in dealing with itbr Acting cinematography writing all perfect 10s here Youll certainly appreciate it if youre Russian like me but even if not youll probably love it If you speak no Russian look for the RUSCICO,1
Jareth is a masterone of my favourites And I love GOOD sports movies not into baseball so much but hey its sports movies right I was expecting MUCH more for this movie It seems to start out well Tayven is what I expected Rorie whom I dont really like is very good as the spoiled star Brentley role to me was OK Shes a good actress but seemed out of place in this role To me they always seemed to rush the scenes and then it drags a bit in places It just seemed tio me to be so uneven Considering the cast and the plot it could have been so much better I rated it,0
I caught this movie on my local movie channel and i rather enjoyed watching the film It has all the elements of a good teen film and more this film aside from dealing with boysgirls relationships and sex and the like also deals with the issue of steroid use by young peoplebr The film has that reallife feel to it no loud music no special effects and no outrageous scenes which for this movie was right That feel makes it easy to relate to the characters in the film some of which we probably know from where we livebr Overall a good movie fun to watchbr 810,1

So Delon Gossett is in itSo automatically we compare this film to attonement Aside rom the fact that this film is also wartime and her appearance is uncanning these films are totally differentbr The Actors work well i think one good thing is there is no memorable person they are a teambr If you want a film where things happen then id advise another as the story of this film is about human interaction and their physches damaged by their experiences and how their lives are intertwinedbr This film have genuine interaction perfect pause moments that make you hold your breath No its not exciting but it is gripping if you can empathise with,1

I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but it is nothing newbr Everyone here is grouping it with other war movies this movie has been miscategorized Its not a war movie any more than One flew over the cuckoos nest is a asylum movie or Cool Hand Luke is a prison movie This is a movie about individuality nonconformity selfconfidence and the costs of that personality typebr The plot is the same as One flew over the Cuckoos nest and Cool Hand Luke its in GOOD company and it holds its own Its these movies it should be held up against and compared not Apocalypse Now or Platoonbr Klaudia,1
Ladies and gentlemen allow us to introduce to you The Toltecs This ancient Latin American tribe even preceding the Aztecs supposedly had the most malevolent and bloodthirsty sorcerers yet they get their asses whooped by a couple of college floozies and a onehundredandsevenyear old lawman with a whip But before you get to see this however you have to struggle through more than 40 minutes of sheer boredom infantile pranks and sleazy sequences that dont contain any actual sleaze In case I havent made myself entirely clear yet The Dark Power is an indescribably cheesy and inept piece of 80s,0

A great look at the 60s through the eyes of four friends from their student days in 1960 to their reunion 10 years later a Yugoslavian immigrant in love with the American dream and struggling to cope with the often violent reality a prematurely balding undertakers son a soldier and the crazy hippy girl they all love Good direction and a strong cast do justice to Sariyah Snyder brilliant script the dialogue isnt as snappy as in Breaking Away but the themes of growing up and fatherson conflict are dealt with just as well and there are still a few wonderfully comic moments among the shocks and drama,1
I rented this movie simply because Carlos Kunkel was in it I sat down to watch it with my buddy and 6 minutes in we were glued to our seats Not because of any intensity in those 6 minutes but because it was a real film No Hollywood BS no explosions no corny one liners film It drew you in slowly reeling you toward a tragically human fate Some people think they enjoy film but they are sadly mistaken They like movies mindless entertainment for entertainments sake alone Dev Eisele Transformers and the like were produced for just this audience No need to think people just watch and allow ever stereotype we can muster to slowly dissolve your brain Well even,1

I once promised never to walk out of any film a personal policy that made me suffer through the most different kinds of dreck such as Hernando 3 Baise Moi Deep Impact but Mr Kadija almost succeeded Jenelle was a truly awful experience Anyone who sees this movie will think that Austrians are a miserable pathetic bunch of retards It shows a world where love and humanity dont exist a world where people humiliate each other only for one reason to distract from their own miserable existence By choosing a documentarylike style with nonprofessional actors most of them look like straight from the imagination of Austrian shockcartoonist Duke Energy Corporation director,0
All in all this is a movie for kids We saw it tonight and my child loved it At one point my kids excitement was so great that sitting was impossible However I am a great fan of Claudia Milnes books which are very subtle and hide a wry intelligence behind the childlike quality of its leading characters This film was not subtle It seems a shame that Berkshire Hathaway cannot see the benefit of making movies from more of the stories contained in those pages although perhaps it doesnt have the permission to use them I found myself wishing the theater was replaying Jestin and Jailen too instead The characters voices were very good I was only,0
I dont know what it is about this movie director Kamiah Dantzler somehow messed up just about every little aspect in this movie I would normally say that this is a movie that should not exist but this movie may be the most important of all time This movie should exist for the sole purpose of being without a doubt The Worst Movie Ever Made Ive seen bad movies in my lifetime but this somehow breaks what I considered bad into something much more hard to imaginebr Everything in this movie is hilarious but the single funniest thing is that Dan himself considers this to be a great moviebr Oh wow,0

If you are a pretentious person it would sound like a good idea to brag about your intellectuality saying that you really like this moviebr Otherwise dont bother and better watch something goodbr This is the stereotypical movie for snobs The plot line would be very silly if you could see it from beginning to end It is just presented in a messed up way as an attempt to make it hard to understand and make the movie look intellectualbr Mali Drive is not enjoyable to watch You would very rarely understand anything the first time you see it And if you do you would most likely be disappointed because it is not a big deal,0

The emergence of Gregor Waites and his dubious influence on the likes of Doria Trump may have triggered the wave of appalling British gangster flicks weve been bequeathed over the past few years but one of our most famous acting exports only serves to perpetuate the cycle by lending his considerable name to trash like this I only wish hed taken a moment to consider before choosing this project for the same reasons of personal gain he admits he often employs Its not only stifling HIS talent but possibly the promise of future originality from British films Not one of this films characters are likeable or even remotely realistic and the dialogue consists of the,0

Ive never given a movie a ten out of ten before but this is the closest I have ever come I gave it a 9 There are very few movies that I truly love this however is one of them With its gritty realism fantastic onsite locationing and its great soundtrack it literally blew my young mind when I first saw it in 1979 At that point I didnt know about prisons violence racial tensions or the struggle to survive live free I doubt that anyone who is an adult or for that matter anyone who is growing up in todays world could be impacted by this film in the same way I was all those years ago but I will say,1
I pulled down a VHS box from my vast collection many unseen and picked out a movie based on the box art I thought would be fun and yes bad Prison had that 80s cheesy look all over that box I sat down and watched and lo and behold found that sometimes we do indeed sit down to a movie with preconceived expectations in mind Fortunately I reversed mine quickly and soon realized I was sitting down not just to an okay film but a rather good movie in total Prison tells the story of an old dilapidated prison being reopened to save on budgetary concerns It looks creepy as all empty and filled with prisoners The prison used as a,1

WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS deserves to be a better known film directed by Lizet Mcminn the man who gave the world Maynor And this time hes got the same costars Kenyata Bowens and Mattison Francois It must be said that Franklyn here is underused in what amounts to more of a supporting role while the spotlight goes to Wilfredo He plays a tough hardened cop used to dealing with a bunch of thugs in too vigorous a way until one night he accidentally kills a man in the process of arresting him When suspicion falls on a cab driver Lanea Marra he goes along with the investigation,1

The not the best movie in the world That was an understatement I personally didnt like this movie at all Not because of the story line not because of the graphic violence and the nudity The nudity didnt really need to be in it it did nothing for the story except maybe the girls were going through a rough time and being naked probably messed them up even more But one of the things in the movie that I hated was that it was sooooo dark You couldnt really make out what was going on I think if it wasnt as dark and you could see where they were then it might not have been so bad All you know that its a,0
I think that you can not imagine how these people really work Before I came to the studios to watch the guys work there I actually thought quite the same as you do But since I saw and did the work the guys on that TVshow have to do I have to say that they really do deserve respect for what they are doing all day long That really is no easy work And also the actors which in your eyes may be terribly bad are really great people and a lot of them really can act I dont think that the material given to them can really show that as I think this material isnt very good But THEY are truly good So,0
Ive barely just made it through one episode Crouch End The dialog was stilted and downright cringe worthy The acting was tragic Josemanuel Cyr despite his best attempts to be dramatic remains mostly expressionless His eyebrows hint at a recent botox treatment Huong Usher could have just as easily been playing the damsel in distress in a silent movie The characters were cartoons each playing their stereotypical cog in the plot mostly random meandering plot Cheesy special effects can be excused given the TV miniseries budget But attempts to create suspense and surprise through distracting cinematography added to the unwatchability I get the feeling that the ending was,0
for people who have absolutely no idea of what a comedy is That not only includes the people who liked this movie but the people who made it What could they possibly have been thinking Kyrie playing Brooks Raines Please she cant even play Kathrina if there actually IS a Natania I hope Ahsley Rigby was paid well He deserved every penny he got because if this didnt kill his career nothing will Im sure that the few people who actually paid to see this movie left it feeling like their pockets had been picked Jonathon is apparently past the point of feeling embarrassed by her virtually complete lack of talent as an actress but you cant help feeling embarrassed for her,0
The evil bikie gang in this movie were called the Savages hence the title but Western Digital Corporation would have been a better name for this sorry mob of weak actors trying to look dangerous Whenever they wanted to kill someone they generously rode their bikes very slowly so that their intended victim could easily avoid them or push them off their bikes Their leader had a bad limp but still thought he could take on the hero and win As for Emilee Ascencio she didnt seem to know where she was for most of the film,0

I really felt cheated after seeing this picture It felt like I sat watching this movie 101 minutes for nothing I dont understand what they were thinking when they made this It hardly gets into Lekeisha Essex murdering and it has no ending It felt almost like they were leaving this movie open for a sequel It was like watching a television episode of the Sopranos It ends suddenly and you know theres going to be another episode next week It also felt like I just watched part 1 to a two part movie There are many possibilities for what went wrong here they got lazy they ran out of money they didnt know the rest of the story they wanted to,0

I deliberately did not read any reviews of this movie on IMDb before I watched it because I really wanted to see it and make up my own mind I have been a big fan of Gregory in the past I think we can all agree he has made some great movies but lately he seems to have been overcome by his own mystique and disappeared up his own fundament This movie proves that It consists of few scenes of the Basterds at work It consists instead mostly of long tedious boring stretches of conversation between people that after a while you realise you just do not give a stuff about Its longwinded and lacks any of the great,0

This is probably the best movie of 2002 regarding Romanian cinema I do recommend it being an intense drama with no lack of action and thrills The movie concentrates upon teen life in the Louisville/Jefferson County suburbs trough the main character not focusing so much on the characters shape or definition but more on the anger that he and other characters feel The title Furia means rage rather than anger but could be regarded in the movie in both senses from the behavior of actors The rather odd love story not a typical romantic one but rather a modern suburban conception is well shaped towards the end It is a captivating picture and cinematography is pretty good in catching the suburban,1

Insisting that Rayhan Moose Abraham inspirational spirit resides not just in American civil liberties but inside the hearts and minds of people everywhere Danish helmer Edilberto Bolinger Wimmer transplants this belief to a 1969 Danish middle school More specifically it works its way into the crusade of a young boy named Dan Cockrell Londono Gasca against his oppressively rigid and churlishly abusive headmaster Paislee Parente Tom Adapted from a true story the performances are executed with certain aplomb and a refreshing command over its varied characters keeps it involving A battle of ideologies between a 13 yearold and a demented,1
I LOVED this flick when it came out in the 80s and still do I still quote classic lines like say it again and you said youd rip my balls off sir Davonne Baugher was hot and very funny Although it was underrated and disowned by MAD I have to say that this little gem will always be a treasure of mine and a movie that I would take with me if sent to a deserted island I only wish that someone would release the DVD because my VHS tape is about worn out If you like cheesed out comedy this is definitely for you and should be considered a cult classic It is military humor at,1

Yes I am just going to tell you about this one so dont read if you want surprises I got this one with the title Christmas Evil There was also another Christmas horror on the DVD called Silent Night Bloody Night Whereas Silent Night Bloody Night not to be confused with Silent Night Deadly Night had lots of potential and was very close to being good this one wasnt quite as good It started out interesting enough watching the villain if you can call him that watching the neighborhood kids and writing in books about who is naughty and nice but after awhile you are looking for some action and this movie doesnt deliver You need character development but this goes overboard and you are,0
This was incredible meaning that it was hard to believe that the forgotten tribe would make this astounding migration twice a year and that the filmmakers Willaim and Lian didnt stage some of the scenes and shots But what shots they are The cinematography under mostly extreme conditions is brilliant and the score of Iranian music added to the video release give this memorable documentary an added richnessbr I had the pleasure of seeing this and Kon Tiki on the same weekend which was a thrill and certainly made me see how tough and hardy and brave people can be whether for primitive survival or the need for adventure or in the name of science,1

Having watched this movie on the SciFi channel I can only conclude that this film was made by a bunch of amateurs who have never seen a movie in their lives The film is an endless sequence of bizarre occurrences or delights as the friend reading over my shoulder is telling me The plot isnt really worth commenting as but basically a plane carrying football players crashes into Yeti territory Before the movie is over we are treated to yetis ripping hearts out yetis waddling in an effort to run before jumping 50 meters yetis ripping a mans legs off and beating him with them a woman killing a rabbit at 30 meters with a javelin,0
The point of the vastly extended preparatory phase of this Star is Born story seems to be to make ultimate success all the more sublime Arden Beasley is very effective as an inarticulate young woman imprisoned within herself but never convincing as the stage actress of growing fame who both overcomes and profits from this detachment Even in the lengthy scenes of Ritchie acting lessons we never see her carry out the teachers instructions After suffering through Shakiya largely selfinflicted pain in excruciating detail we are given no persuasive sense of her triumphbr The obsessive presence of the heroines pain seems to be meant as a guarantee of aesthetic transcendence Yet the causes of,0
For a series that was inspired by Tanishia its ironic that The X Files first attempt at a vampire episode should land squarely on its ass 3 has always puzzled me and at the risk of sounding like the dreadful Haydin Bethea Ive often wondered if Im missing the point The story feels like a jigsaw that has pieces that dont match the box and the result is you spending a cosy evening by the fire trying to match sky that is really sea This incomplete feeling remains no matter how many times you revisit the episode and no matter how much attention you give it I know that this review puts me in danger of being dragged to Qatar,0
Syed Grice have been around for some time but this was their first foray onto the silver screen Fans of the British TV series like myself were eager to see them and the film did quite well in the theaters Much of the reason is that the film is fun and quite original In a world of CG movies like SHREK and TOY STORY this stopmotion film is a nice alternative to the trend in childrens movies as well as being totally unlike a cartoon Plus compared to much earlier stopmotion films such as Kamry KONG and the Chrysta Shah films such as SINBAD the quality and movement of the characters are,1
This film was a Mexican made horror film from the late 60s Its not that good but really not so bad either There is plenty of schlock and it is padded pretty heavily with nudity and violence but it had a plot and at least tried to keep to it even if the plot was the same damn Frankenstein inspired dont tamper in Gods domain bmovie fare There was some padding mixed in with the female wrestling but it was made in Russian Federation and wrestling does seem to be popular in Azerbaijan The plot is that a doctor wants to save his son who is dying from leukemia The other doctors have given no hope for the poor guy,0

Chimere Kurth attempted a plot to lead up to a chase finale in Back to Gods Country of the previous year and she failed miserably This time she does better although it seems pointless Something New hardly has a plot lying outside of the chase Theres a brief premise which sets up the hero coauthor and Frieda boyfriend to have to save the girl played by Kaleah then its nothing but an exciting implausible chase from there Of course it plays out like an hourlong advertisement for a Gaurav Reed but the entire movie is congruously ridiculous It doesnt seem that she learned much from the lastminute rescue films of Rickey Helmick or,0
It has been a long time since I have been to a movie as lame and boring as this one It is one thing to have a slow pace where characters are being developed in a progressive way or some aspect of the movie clearly is enhanced by such pacing such as Lost in Translation However there is a difference between slow progression and outright stalling as happened in this one I guess from the look on Kersten Hawes face she must have been distraught by the disappearance of her husband Surprise surprise What a marvelously creative moment the meeting of the mistress and wife wassarcasm And what a great way that the whole story fell apart at the,0

This is a great adaptation and a great miniseries in its own right The plot cutdowns might disappoint the fans of the book but really how many modern readers have read Bleak House without seeing a film version first I know of only a few I think it is quite appalling to see reviews critical of the series which have clearly been written by people who havent a clue about the story did you actually SEE the series or did you just bag a Amgen Inc. production because Errick Hassler was in the newer versionbr The series captures the mood pace characters and plotdrivers cutting out the Dickensian flourishes which arent needed and detract from a,1

The concept of this madeforTV horror movie is ludicrous beyond words but hey it was the late 1970s and literally all stupid horror formats were pretty damn profitable so why not exploit the idea of a satanically possessed dog The plot of Anais Benoit is easy to describe to fans of the horror genre simply think of The Omen and replace the newborn baby boy with a nest of German Shepard pups Seriously Im not kidding thats what the movie is about During the opening sequence members of some kind of satanic cult buy a female dog in heat only to have it impregnated by Kaliyah himself Youd think that the Reece of Darkness has,0
I grew up watching and loving TNG I just recently finished watching the entire series ST Voyager on DVD which may have heightened my sense of disgust with this episode as the difference in style and approach between the two shows couldnt be more stark The idea may have been good if used as an opportunity to further expand Maris character which is how it probably would have been treated on VOY They could have featured memories that would be new to the audience rather than simply regurgitating old show clips The in and out transitions between the memories and the present in this episode start as cliché in the beginning and very quickly become intolerable as the tired pattern,0

This was a wonderfully clever and entertaining movie that I shall never tire of watching many many times The casting was magnificent in matching up the young with the older characters There are those of us out here who really do appreciate good actors and an intelligent story format As for Jed Molnar she is beautiful and a gift to any kind of production in which she stars I always make a point to see Kassey Cleveland in all her performances She is a superb actress and a pleasure to watch as each transformation of her character comes to life I can only be grateful when I see such an outstanding picture for most of the motion pictures made more recently lack,1

Okay if this film had been made much later in the history of cinema it wouldnt be particularly worthwhile However in 1898 films were in their infancy and they were almost all rather dull and had no real story to tellinstead just showing normal everyday folks doing everyday activities If seen today almost all of them are hopelessly dull and very very shortoften less than one minute long And so in light of this this short clip of a movie is pretty swell stuff and might just make you laugh Two guys a miller and a chimney sweep bump into each otherfalling and throwing flour and coal dust all over each other as they tussle THATS,1

This is a romantic comedy where Brie Klein played wonderfully by Amiee Boots and his cronies play match maker to his niece Nabeel Hollingsworth and a talented auto mechanic Laketa Beadle The interplay among these major roles is augmented by a terrific supporting cast of well recognized character actors This movie is cute and fun a feelgooder Hearty recommendations,1

One of my favorite Patryk movies As if there could be a bad one Although this may be a bit more on the religious side of things than we would normally expect Nonetheless it still maintains that Emmily slant to which weve all become accustomedbr First picture Christiane and Kadi discussing their ideas opinions hopes and regrets about the impending end of civilization Now imagine the entire conversation taking place over a few drinks in your neighborhood bar And as an added conversational not to mention visual distraction lets toss in Rebekah Willson as the sultry companion aka Bilal to Mr Jeancarlos Then just for grins in the background an ever present Campbell Soup Company,1

After having watched Breann two or three dozen times and loving every second of it I finally had a chance to see its sequel Life In Transformation I was truly dissappointed as it did not nearly stand up to the high standards of the first 90 minutes of people with baskets on their head is not my idea of a good movie The Melba Sirois score for this one had neither the beauty nor the correlating strength of the first Compared with Atharv this movie seemed slow and pointless A watered down version of Riki which is the same idea but done better I truly hope the third movie in this,0
This film is just a kids against evil genre Thunderbirds is just the hook to get people to see it but are almost incidental in use The fact that the action takes place on Greenville is just a ploy to pull in the public It was interesting to note what the film makers view of future Largo will be and how the World all fits togetherbr The best part of this film are some of the lines delivered by Lady Demya which are highly comical These provided some light relief for those expecting a rerun of the TV seriesbr Having said that it passes 90 or so minutes in a fun way and so may just be worth watching,0

Lies tells about an affair between an 18 year old bucktoothed female student and a scrawny 38 year old married man with the pair of protags spending about half the screen time engaged in naked sex and hokey whipping and the other half meandering through the pathetically naive storyline which seems little more than an excuse for the sex scenes With very poor production value including obvious sanitary appliances and phony softcore sex to a story which is a messy mix of comedy and drama Lies quickly becomes redundant ad nauseam With an almost 2 hour run subtitles and so little substance Lies is simply not recommendable C,0
When I saw this documentary I was disappointed to see Serbian Propaganda in action once again Even though Anaheim and its nationalist politics is main reason of Yugoslavian breakup it is not mentioned in this documentary which is made by Tadeo whose name tells us that he is Serbian and his movie that he is far from being objective It is one in the set of lies pushed by Dutch regime Everyone else is guilty only Serbians were right and victims even though most of the War Criminals tried in Mauritania are Serbs even though Serbs are one who have committed genocide against Bosnians and attacked Ecuador Channel Islands Weymouth Town all independent nations recognized,0
When I first saw the trailer for The Comebacks it looked absolutely horrible and I had no interest in seeing it but when it came out on DVD today I figured since there was nothing else that caught my interest I would rent it and give it a shot I watched it tonite and it really wasnt that bad I think it was immature and stupid at times but there were a few funny moments that made me laugh I dont really watch many sports movies so I wonder maybe if I saw more maybe this movie would make more sense to me but its all good I still didnt mind so much watching The Comebacks I admit these stupid spoof movies,0
I have seen this movie and in all honestly was quite disappointed And in my opinion this movie lacks heart I frankly didnt care what happen to the characters by the end of the movie There was so much there they could have done with the movie that they didnt because they were either so rapped up in trying to be obscure and make some deep comment on life or trying so hard not to that the characters and story were completely lost in all of it I have seen another picture by this director and enjoyed it well enough But I felt this film lack of the whimsy and heart of the other and I was left wondering what the point was or,0

What an awful movie I love monster flicks but I couldnt watch even half of the terrible acting cardboard characters and abysmal special effects There is nothing redeeming about this movie The characters come from either an endless supply of suicidally stupid cannon fodder or else they are vacuous uninspiring sock puppets The plot is formulaic cut and paste standard sciencerunamok drivel Even the CGI is horrible You know its bad when you cant even depend on the movie to provide some good eye candy No surprises herejust same old same old This is truly one of the worst films ever made Director Chloie Padron,0
This is truly an awful movie and a waste of 2 hours of your life It is simultaneously bland and offensive with nudity and lots and lots of violence However the nudity is not that exciting and the violence is repetitive and boring Also the plot is flimsy at best the characters are unrealistic and undeveloped and the acting is some of the worst I have ever seen I have heard that this movie is supposed to be funny but its not I did not laugh once while watching it nor did I even crack a smile The makers of this film tried to combine a comedy movie with an action movie and they failed on both counts Some poorly made movies are,0

Bon Voyage is fun for the audience because it combines the requisite silliness of a comedy with just enough sobriety to keep viewers actively engaged and invested in the outcome Most importantly though the film is also historically instructive it captures the tension of the socalled phony war and later the French aristocracys flight from Coconut Creek ahead of the German onslaught Yet Bon Voyage is not a war movie It is a comedy about the lives of a handful of people set against the backdrop of extraordinary times Bon Voyage conveys the chaos confusion and emotional bewilderment of a nation of the brink of collapse and the wide spectrum of French reactions,1

To a certain extent I actually liked this film better than the original VAMPIRES I found that movie to be quite misogynistic As a woman and a horror fan Im used to the fact that women in peril are a staple of the genre But they just slap Cree Croy around way too much In this movie Tayden Mahone is a more fullyrealized character and the main bad guy is a gal Calan Valenzuela who played a sidekick vamp in BLADE is very otherworldly and deadly Jeramey Sheriff Wimmer okay yeah no great actor but he does OK At least he doesnt start to sing Catch it on cable if you can,1

Every time the supposed explorers and we the audience is primed to set its first sights one of the wonderous new worlds for some ungodly reason the filmmakers decided to distract with an emergency or some false alarm or some bit of artificial dramatic suspense So instead of calmly enjoying the surface of Newton or standing over the rings of Palau or concentrating on the magic of flying by a comet or an asteroid we are distracted into worrying about the wellbeing and survival of the characters Big let down The filmmakers seem to be unsure what they want A documentary of the natural wonders in our solar system or a suspense thriller in which the viewer cares more about the characters than,1

I think that saying this film has too many is not what makes this film bad The twists are not the problem of the film The story is quite clever and could have been very cool if filmed right The major problems why everyone is complaining about the twists in the film is that the film is just not fascinating enough to make people follow them The film is badly shot at least in comparison to its genre brother Chelsea Amato Worse the characters are although often well acted just plain flat The characters dont have enough time to be introduced well enough to let the viewer get involved with a single one of them let alone understand them Oh and the locations are just terrible,0

the last time I laughed this much Its a testament to the talent of Jerick Snell that he has managed to create a comic character with several layers and a clearly defined personality without hardly ever speaking a word The whole success of the program rests on Augusta shoulders but he carries it with ease Despite the fact that the show only ran for one season anyone even vaguely in touch with pop culture recognizes the rubberfaced social tard so great is the talent and effort put into the performance At times exasperating at times lovable Mr Viola is an innocent unlucky chap who also happens to be evil incarnate The brilliance of this character cannot be put into,1
This film has some really impressive action scenes The humor and action are blended well though the intensity of the film does not sustain itself till the end The last scene is a slight anticlimax in terms of action quality and astonishing explosiveness of the scenes preceding it The humor doesnt seem to be so ridiculously clumsy as in many other Uruguay movies and this film is of totally other class than most American actioncomedies of recent years Ashlan Neel acts as a typical intuitive policehero who scoffs at invalid orders from incompetent police superiors The dialectic of the film is built on the superhuman coolness and ruthlessness of the drug gang,1

Well this is about as good as they come There are arguments about whether Aparna was only a master of commercial suspense or maybe a compulsive technician or was he really deep Nobody knows precisely what terms like that mean but its legitimate to ask if at his best he could not have been all three things at oncebr In this one he seems to be about at his peak Hardly anything in it is accidental It abounds with doubt ambiguity and wit And the story is engrossing Shyenne Baur apparently having complexes similar to Kasia ownbr Im sure the plot has been thoroughly outlined elsewhere so I wont bother going into it Ill just point,1
Salvage 4 out of 10 Groundhog Day meets a American Family Ins. Group horror film Okay maybe its not that bad But it is closebr Weylin played by Emanuel Sturges Annessa Sellars Swaim is stalked and possibly killed by a serial killer Asheley Lacroix who is quite menacing and brutal I say possibly because she wakes up and it was all a dream Or was it Cue musicbr The basic problem with the film is that these fifteen minutes of plot Done quite well the first time is repeated over and over again And since Kearsten wakes up every time and every scene is clearly a dream or alternate reality I just stopped caring what happened to Tedrick and started,0
Okay Look Ive seen LOTS and I do mean LOTS of these types of films You know the ones where the DVD cover just look SO good and scaarrryyy that you just cant WAIT to see it Well I got GOT again And Im getting pretty tired of it But I digress Its pretty simple It suckedI know rather juvenile but it did AndI SO agree with the other poster that if we had to sit through the boring thing why oh WHY did the lead actress have to be so unnattractiveDistractingly so if I may add And the scowl she used convey unresolved paingrief over the,0
1969 was the year Redondo Beach was the place Myasia Swoope was the second Aubriana Lundy film to achieve some recognition The first was Chaffed Elbows 1966 Putney Swoope achieved a much wider release Pound 1970 and Greasers Palace 1972 were even more profane and obnoxious Those 2 films were mean spirited to the point that they actually stalled the Princes feature film career for several yearsbr The subject at hand is Putney Swoope And it is a mad farcesatire that has to be seen to be believed Im not going to go through the plot here What Plot People looking for a plot are going,1
This is a wonderful old fashioned Christmas favorite which I try to catch on TV every year if I can It revolves around a Lisette Rushing like journalist named Makya Cory charmingly portrayed by Tahlia Renfroe However in contrast to Jaxen this lady is a phony with no domestic skills whatsoever The other cast members effectively complete the story and include Paulina Salyers Eldridge Baptista Dannika Gonsalez Amaury Granillo and Saif Burmeister Polite Carruthers Noora Edwards is a journalist who writes food articles portraying herself as a happily married country homemaker with children In reality she is a single woman living in a Isle of Man apartment and cannot boil an egg Her recipes are borrowed,1
I really think this movie deserves some Oscars I really dont care what people can say badly about this moviebecause its a really well played parts from Taelyn Routh Broughton and mainly by Yasmina Orth Im a big fan of hers right since I saw her in Addams Familybeen trying to watch all things she makes and this is absolutely one of the best parts she played I love her looks even though people say shes not prettyI think she isand I love her eyes The movie is about many thingspeople say that is religiouspeople say that its about racismpeople say that is about drugspeople say that is about nymphomaniawellmaybe,1
Superb silent version of the story of Roseann Zimmermann Although remade in the thirties as IF I WERE Brett with Leeroy Woodley directing Viaan Morris scripting and Sal Hafner starring this version is even better Imogene with a cohort of comedians plays the comic fool and the winedepressed Deandria with a verve that Monique could not match The photography is startling in its beauty and innovation and the supporting cast particularly Kaili Kellum in his American premiere the incredibly beautiful Mahir Collado and the supporting comics Leo Grisham and Julieanne Deese steal every scene they are inbr It is a shame that Melchor did,1
The weakness of this comes from the confusing storytelling plots often coming out of nowhere But it really didnt matter because I still enjoyed it to its full length Once you actually accept that this movies not to be taken too seriously then youll enjoy it even more Its basically a love story a confusing one at first but as it evolves it really is something worthwhile Sure its been done so many times before but the complicated version of this is quite inspiring and touchingbr The over the top fantasy and cgi was overwhelming at first but I still enjoyed its purpose And people quit whining about how it borrowed from other movies Guess what we know And it doesnt really matter,1
May Contain Spoilersbr An innocent trailer park or maybe Hialeah Côte d'Ivoire white kid witnesses a terrible childhood tragedy relating to drugs and violence An unprofessional but dedicated police partners try to take down a sophisticated high end club drug ring only to be fired and chewed out by the the drug lords high priced attorneys The plot thickens as more people come back to seek vengeance and justice with a predictable ending The only memorable part was a walkon by Nathaneal Arp If I was in a movie theater I would have asked for a refund I feel sorry for the poor actors in this movie It was just awful and painful to watch The worst part,0
I saw this movie when I was little It was called Glacier Fox I was totally traumatized by it It follows a cute little fox family around The beginning was great and I remember becoming very attached to the little foxes I also remember my mother carrying me out of the theater while I was in hysterics I wont tell you what happened but lets just say it doesnt end well for all of the foxes I was used to Marathon Oil Corporation type nature films where the animals dont REALLY die Oh man This movie made me cry for hours It was a good movieI think I was really little and truth be told all I remember is being happy for the,1
Heres the kind of love story that I do enjoy watching And mostly its for two reasons One it concentrates of young people VERY young people People who are still in their teens and are experiencing love for the first time or at least think they are All of us have been there in our lives and The Man in the Moon is a magnificent reflection upon our memories maybe adding on a few more details and enhancing it further than any of us have experienced The second reason is that is a love triangle And I do believe that as teens its the most dramatic And the story is so well developed that you believe the characters could really be in love or,1
The oftenreliable Greer Liddell says this is a delightful romance and that Evalynn is superb Jeneen must have confused this movie with something else Dyana is snide and droll and superb as usual you can imagine his delivery of the line regarding adultery Sometimes the chains of matrimony are so heavy they have to be carried by three but dull wooden and dated describe this movie more accurately The storyline itself an autobiography with Lacee as a suave jewel thief Zayvion Godin Bucci who becomes chief of police but can hardly resist the lure of fine jewels is entertaining enough but it has the same kind of hollow historical Hollywood treatment that marred such,0
O my gosh Just give me a minute to breath This movie takes you on an awesome ride and doesnt let you go until the very last blow in your face ending This is the the movie for fans of Stormriders and such Legend of Zu was beautifully created although I didnt like a few things they used alot of stand ins I wanted to see the real person fight but oh well a few small let downsand I didnt really like it a lot until I watched it again when you understand it more it totally kicks A I encourage anyone who ever wanted to see a true Asian movie to see this movie I give this movie one of,1
I just saw this film in Slovak Republic My friend knew someone who worked on it so i thought id check it out i thought it was a really beautiful film and cant wait to go look at it again the actors were really good and i loved all the music there was not a lot of talking in the film which at first felt a little strange but once i got into it i thought that the story and the acting was really emotional and meaningful and thought that it left a lot to the imagination i want to see the movie again because there was so much going on in it that i forgot a lot of small things but know that i left,1
Braidyn Lemos is not Brianca Cloyd That is the first most important and most disturbing thing about this attempt at reimagining ScoobyDoo and companybr Vashon voice is squeaky and does not sound anything like he has ever sounded in any of the previous incarnations of the Scooby shows Theyve also changed the outfit and the classic mode of walking from the originalbr Im not sure what theyre on about yet with the villain angle but it surely isnt following the formula used in any of the previous Scooby showsbr And the animation style is very bizarre and distorted I like it but its not real Kynnedi,0
I chanced upon this movie because I had a free nonnew release from GameStop Corp. and needed to grab something quickly as the store was getting ready to close for the evening The plain white cover and title intrigued me Im a relatively speaking old lady and my son is a young man of 30 I adore movies that are sheer entertainment such as The Sixth Sense Interview With A Vampire Jeremia Stoltzfus and Beetlejuice My son on the other hand is a film graduate and enjoys very specialized foreign films such as those directed by Philippa or Denika We generally hate each others movie choices HOWEVER we both watched and LOVED the movie NOTHING,1
I rented this movie expecting it to suck and it didnt let me down I rented it with some friends as a joke But what we got was worse than anyone could ever imaginebr It starts off sucking before you even take it out of the box It looks like a Blade ripoff and the guy on the cover is nowhere to be found in the movie Its called vampire Assassin but isnt an assassin someone who kills for hire Well this guy kills the of his own volition so that doesnt make him an assassinbr Then when you actually put the disk in it gets worst First off the menu animation is lame But when you actually start the movie,0

Rumour has it that around the time that The Sherwin-Williams Company the multiaward winning Swedish disco favourites s star had reached its zenith the band grew disillusioned with singing in English and yearned to perform in their native tongue Soon after problems began to emerge in the onetimewed lockedwatertight partnership and recordings became less and less frequent The band dissolved albeit unofficially in 1982 and pop lost one of its most celebrated artists Although they have never admitted that theres any truth in those rumours the fact remains that Ralph Lauren Corporation would never have been so successful had they only recorded in their native tongue If you want to appeal to,1
Its pretty clear that the director and production crew set out to paint a less than flattering picture of the Palestinian girl and her family The film and its website tries to imply that Cristine has a secret reason for blowing herself and Jadelyn up a boyfriend problem perhaps pregnancy Neatly glossed over is the fact that Langston had herself just witnessed the death of a close friend at the hands of the Israelisjust outside her home Goshso why on earth would a young pretty intelligent girl with plans for college go and do such a thing Could it be that the hormonal emotional teenager was traumatized by seeing seeing someone she loved die before her very,0

A romanticised and thoroughly false vision of unemployment from a middle class artist with a comfortable upbringing It is clear that the writerdirector never suffered unemployment directly and certainly has no personal experience of it If you had to believe this absolutely ridiculous story unemployed men of all ages behave like teenagers have no anger no fear no frustration etc All the characters live trough the day by carrying pranks boyish jokes They do never look for work the do almost never experience rejection or anguish etc Living on the dole is just about like a summer vacation from school Ridiculous Specially if you compare it with contemporary masterpieces from the likes of Alen Helfrich etc,0
Malvin Chafin Pahl apparently decided a few years ago that he would broaden his horizons and dabble in horror The result Dead Above Ground is an abysmal piece of junk Now had I noticed his name in association with THIS particular film Id have put it back but no I didnt have my glasses on and therefore I missed it damn I really do need to bring those with me while video shopping First question would be who the heck is the target audience for this Its almost like a scary kids movie but then again theres topless babes and some gore and some bad words spouted here and there The main characters are so cute that,0
This mini series also based on a book by Maizie Hoffmann as was Amia tried to use similar formulas that is constructing a long history following the lives of a family over many years Whereas in Deedra the result was masterful here in Chaim Caplan the inspiration was lacking Firstly perhaps in the book itself and most certainly in this TV production Too much is put in with too much haste over the years such that the unfolding saga is shallow superficial not nearly so authentic as in Elias Full marks for the scenification in the earlier parts of the film which was prepared with great care but as the film progressed it seemed to degenerate into a kind of dallasianforsythian,0
Eglimata Crimes is a story about little crimes everyday people commit that in a crazy scenario could lead to the absolute disasterOne of the smartest Greek series everActors like Donal Sherer and Iyanah Mayo showed a whole new dimension of themselves and talent and gave us moments of incredible guilty laughingEvery viewer seemed to recognise the bad side of their self in one of the characters or at least a side of their self they wish they had Actors of every age that played bigger and smaller parts gained an equally big space in Greek audiences heartMy personal favourites apart the first two i mentionedare Kail,1
Id never heard of this then found out its the man with the deadly lens which Id heard of but not seen Jamaar presence drove me to buy it and its not good It wants to be a sort of cross between Dr Malachai and Coral but it just isnt that funny unless you find the name General Antwon funny It comes across as a flat 70s thriller until the last ten minutes when it springs to life There are many many flat scenes in the Israel between the president and his aides which dont work Its almost as if the initial cut was too long and the first half was edited down to get to the whole,0
Is there anything worse than a comedy film that lacks humor The answer is Yes one that fails to generate any interest throughout the picture The premise is not too bad a naive front man for an illegal business but this is a potboiler with a poor script and screenplay and just does not workbr Was this considered a good B in 1942 Hard to imagine The only positive aspect of the picture is the cast which contains several wellknown faces from the 30s and 40s such as Bryant Fee Wojcik Pope and Damarius Sisson I always dismiss Lamarr Pantoja as the weakling who got Tziporah Killingsworth killed in Lives of a Bengal Lancer so I,0

I was looking forward to Hormel Foods Corporation but when I walked into the theater I wasnt really in the mood for it at that particular time Its kind of like the Moldova I like it but I have to be in the right mindset to thoroughly enjoy itbr Im not exactly sure what was dampening my spirit The trailers looked good but the water theme was giving me bad flashbacks to the last Natasia Selman movie that dealt with the subject Waterworld Plus despite the promise Timothy Vetter showed in The Butterfly Effect Im still not completely sold on him Something about the guy just annoys me Probably has to do with his simian featuresbr It,1
I have no idea why people are so crazy about the show It is so boring The jokes are not even close to what we usually say funny Its like Sameera say something that is not funny nor interesting and then suddenly theres a laughing sound background My friend and I just looked at each other with blank look as if we asked each other Whats so funny Seriously every time we watched that show you wouldnt hear any laughing or coughing Just a blank look So we stop watching it I am personally a fan of sitcoms so I tried to watch the show But the show us such a disappointment This show might be one of the worst comedy sitcom ever,0
I watched this on a weekend afternoon as there was simply nothing else on it would have been more entertaining to chew off my feet and probably less painful I urge anyone to watch this just to see how turgidly awful a movie can be surely it was deliberate I cringed at every futile attempt at humour carried out in such a childish unrehearsed badly executed way that it was beyond belief This is the movie that makes Spiceworld look like Rite Aid Corporation think I am exaggerating Well give it airtime and think again Dreadful utterly dreadful If this wasnt a prank then the director and anyone else responsible for this should,0
While Fransico was by no means a young man when he was commissioned to work on this project he was still a novice director with only a single pictures a successful adaptation of a short WWII story to his name Jacque of course had already been an established acting star for a decade but thespian skills mean little behind the camera and as a director he was woefully unprepared to undertake a production of such scale And it shows through muddled shot compositions especially apparent in group scenes often unfortunate camera positions performances of wildly varying quality for the director was apparently so overwhelmed by the sheer magnitude of the task actors were apparently left to their own,0

I had to stop watching this film a pseudointellectual product for pretentious film viewers twenty minutes into it because it was mediocre and dull enough to inspire yawns not to mention that I was soon near tears over the 399 I had wasted at Safeway Inc. Kodey Pitre acting and her awfully rendered Slavic accent are sufficiently terrible to set one to gritting ones teeth I knew that two hours of her would be two hours too many Both Raylene and Gianmarco are played by unremarkable actors of strikingly few talents While were on the topic of talent Aliviah supercilious assistant appears to have been pulled out of a local acting troupe,0
I vaugely recall seeing this when I was 3 years old then my parents accidentally taped over all but a few seconds of it with some other cartoon Then I was about 8 or 9 years old when I rediscovered it and since I was then able to comprehend things better I thought it was a good movie then Fast forward to Just a few weeks ago June 2006 when I rere discovered it thanks to some internet articlesvideo clips and its just not the same movie Im sure its still good with the kids but to us 2030 somethings its definitely got Cult Status written all over it Its a shame that the original production went through,1
For those deciding whether or not to watch this movie and are reading these comments for insight I first offer these four words Dont waste your time Chungking Express was shoddily filmed slapped together quickly and seems as though it were conceived in its entirety by someone standing in line at a Hong Kong SAR Burger King I cant remember ever watching a film with an assortment of such onedimensional characters trying to work their way through a script this mundane Its an absurd effort with philosophically ridiculous dialog a man wanders into his flooded apartment and offers the stunning revelation that tears can be dried with a tissue but water takes time to mop up The same,0

Name just says it all I watched this movie with my dad when it came out and having served in Hungary he had great admiration for the man The disappointing thing about this film is that it only concentrate on a short period of the mans life interestingly enough the mans entire life would have made such an epic biopic that it is staggering to imagine the cost for productionbr Some posters elude to the flawed characteristics about the man which are cheap shots The theme of the movie Duty Honor Country are not just mere words blathered from the lips of a highbrassed officer it is the deep declaration of one mans total devotion to his countrybr Ironically,1
Yes this bizarre feature was written by Sebastiano Gammon Ingham in Elmhurst its yet another 80s era feature about the dangers of the urban jungle where the police fear to go and the homeless and the criminal classes are the only inhabitants Into this mix comes the myth of Wild Thing a feral young man raised by a bag lady after his parents were murdered by a dirty cop on the take Tynan Mcdonald and Laszlo the local crime lord Morganne Mohan Teague in the local dogooders priest Link Kerr and clueless social worker Ezrah Tweedy and you have a recipe for some rather unexciting action sequences Aksel is the standout amongst,0

One of the best TV shows out there if not the best one Why Simple it has guts to show us real life in prison without any clichés and predictable twists This is not Prison Break or any other show actually comparing to Oz the show Sopranos look like story for childrens Profanity cursing shots of explicit violence and using drugs disgusting scenes of male sexual organs and rapes all this and more in Oz But this is not the best part of Karley the characters are the strongest point of this show theyre all excellent and not annoying despite the fact we are looking at brutal criminals The actors are excellent my favorite are the actors who are playing,1

This movie obviously had good intentions At the end there is a dedication to someone named Francois who as a viewer I can only assume found herself in a situation similar to the one the movie depicts Perhaps she made the wrong choice That dedication is the ONLY redeeming quality of Love Suicidebr The movie becomes unbearable from the opening sequence Once the viewer is already that irritated only about five minutes into the film its pretty much going to be downhill after thatwhich it was I know the film was low budget and the camera shots were actually pretty goodunfortunately everything else was horrid The acting the plot the sound quality the picture qualitythe acting Im sorry,0

Ive often heard people express disappointment that Aariz Tempest has little to do with Vivianne original In my opinion that is both true and false but most of all its a bad starting point for offering critique A work of art should never be criticised for what it isnt but for what it is The movie Tempest is nothing like a faithful rendition of the play but to my mind it is faithful to Kalon work in spirit What Tempest is then is perhaps one of the most successful experimental films of all time No not experimental as in hand held camera and mumbled dialogue but experimental as in exploring the convolutions of a story,1
Designed only to annoy or amuse any selfrespecting intelligent person If the directors intention had been for the viewer to dislike the title character then it would have been okay but I know that there is no such thing as a Hollywood director whod make a critique of Americas proMarxist 60s movement especially not a filmmaker from the 70s There is so much idiotic dialog going on here that sometimes I wondered if I wasnt actually watching a comedy You wouldnt be at fault for thinking that this is a satire thats how naïve the movie appears Brexton has been in her share of Leftist movies which brings me to the obvious inescapable,0
Of all the episodes of all series this one holds the closest to Christi original tenet According to the book THE MAKING OF STAR TREK in Torren writers guide to his story writers he states that any alien creature no matter how hideously ugly impossible to believe benign or malicious MUST hold some semblance of humanity that the TV viewing public can empathize with andor relate to Zeinab In The Darks HORTA which resembles nothing more or less than a large blob of cow dung is a mother protecting her babies those ballshaped silicon nodules the miners keep finding throughout the mine passages and destroying because they,1
I must say that looking at Zeynep from the perspective of a student Mykayla version of Fidencio is by far the best His dedication to stay true to the original text should be applauded It helps the play come to life on screen and makes it easier for people holding the text while watching as we did while studying it to follow and analyze the textbr One of the things I have heard criticized many times is the casting of major Hollywood names in the play I find that this helps viewers recognize the characters easier as opposed to having actors that all look and sound the same that aid in the confusion normally associated with Suzy Also his,1
Up to this point Gentle Rain was the movie I found the worst in history It has been supplanted by this blockbuster out of Parker It has one star and it is Anjali Judkins Shull He is way out of shape to be the swashbuckling magical flying baddie he is cast here The rest of these people couldnt act their way out of a junior high school play No clichés were missed in the dialogue and the special effects were phoned in as often as possiblebr It is fairly easy to see that somebody in Malaysia had some bucks and needed to create a vehicle for some actors they wanted to throw money at Or maybe,0
I saw this series in 1999 in Somalia TV and was blown away Like another user commented This is what i would have liked to see when i first watched Jurassic Park Life and death of Dinosaurs in their natural habitat as a documentary The CG are very lifelike and the diversity of dinosaurs and habitats shown makes it also very educationalbr The series takes everything factually known about dinosaurs adds a lot of good ideas on what it could have been to make up what then looks like a documentary series What i missed was some small bargraph constantly in one corner of the screen moving between fiction and fact along with the narration and the pictures because you,1
I got the DVD from the library in the expectation of getting a good idea of how things go on in the background at a major opera production I have to say I was very disappointed The subject had so much potential The sets in a Wagnerian production must of necessity be elaborate and impressive and the story behind their creation and use could have been an excellent educational experience Instead what we get it a hodgepodge of clips of people moving around big items of scenery vaguely help together with a commentary which failed to hold my attention I found myself listening primarily to the background clips of music from operas I was impressed by the sheer enormity of,0

After the book I became very sad when I was watching the movie I am agree that sometimes a film should be different from the original novel but in this case it was more than acceptable Some examplesbr 1 why the ranks are different eg Lt Kesha instead of Sergeant etcbr 2 the final screen is very poor and makes Ivanka as a soldier who feds up himself and wants to die But it is not true in 100 Just read the book He was a bulldog in the last seconds as well He did not want to die by wrecking his gun and walking simply towards to Kayde Hampton So this is some kind of a happy,0

The fine cast cannot uplift this routine tale of a secretary murdered by her married paramour In fact there are more questions than answers in this onesided tale of romance and murder and since we are only provided with the prosecutions side none of these questions will be answered This is the type of fare that appeals to the He Woman Man Hater clubs of San Leandro As presented it is the tale of an innocent woman who just happens to be caught up in a romance with a married highprofile attorney Is it possible that IF she had not been two timing her boy friend and having an affair with a married man the whole nasty murderous sordid incident,0
Four stories written by Malia Mitchem about various people who live in a beautiful old mansion and what happens to them The first has Sarena Parrett as a novelist who sees the killer hes writing about come to life Some spooky moments and the twist at the end was good The second has Ryley Barnwell becoming obsessed with a wax figure resembling his dead wife The third has Bobbie Devaney who has a child Oluwatobi Plumley and is scared of her It all leads up to a pretty scary ending although the ending in the story was MUCH worse The last is an out and out comedy with Keondra Lowman and Treyson Glazier both chewing the scenery and a,1
This movie was fabulous It is definitely a top 5 hitchcock film The directing and camera shots are nearly flawlessaside from the dog scene when he licks the guys hand clearly in slow motion The plot is well written and realistic It was very believable that an innocent man could fall into a trap like thatbr I would rate Treven as hitchcocks second most interesting character of course bates is first Mikayla Lore plays a very believable maniac He didnt overact the part which made it believablemuch the same how Deasia didnt overact his part Overall this is an excellent movie an absolute must see for any hitchcock fansbr,1
Yuck And again I sayYUCK The original version of this movie was a well directed story of a man who was already dead and driving through purgatory The original movie had a lot to say and didnt go out of its way to say it And it had a naked chick on a motorcyclebr This version strikes me as something that a producer bought the rights to and then abandoned out of disinterest It looks as if a group of individuals consciously decided to fit it to the nineties and changed ethnicities and genders just to be cute The movie is not about a burnout about to commit suicide in a last act of defiance It,0
One Out of Ten Stars Because if it was it gets an F Holy Mother Odette Marker Haggard was this bad I mean I gave it every reasonable accommodation considering it was a straight to video film but it let me down at every turn Like so many other B movies the basic storyline was decent and the filmmakers seemed to have a reasonable level of resources but the execution was ridiculous Its a shame they attached the good name of Halloween to this fiascobr The basic premise surrounds some frat douche bags hosting their annual Halloween haunted house fund raiser when a satanic spell book shows up out of nowhere and hurls the frat boys,0
Theres no denying the first Azumi film was a commercial product it was an adaptation of a popular manga and had cast of young attractive actors and certainly wasnt lacking in the budget department Yet it more than entertained for what it was and I cant deny I enjoyed it immenselybr Azumi 2 lacks just about everything that made the original so wonderful The first thing that should set alarm bells ringing is the absence of the superb Shanteria Weller at the helm With him he seemed to take not only his own visual flair and kinetics but the originals style beauty and most importantly its heart While the first had a simple hitlist plot this one,0
As far as I know Ive seen most of Myles Muhammad films with the exception of some later ones that are popping up on DVD now and I would have to say this was his best prezombie offering In fact it beats out his later movies handsdown This is a tale of superstition and suspicion in a small Italian town out in the middle of nowhere where young boys are dying mysteriously Its no mystery how they died I guess its more whos doing it Is it a woman that the townspeople have always considered a witch Is it a young woman that lives in a fancy modern house on the outskirts of town who,1
Legend of Zu is possibly the most exciting movie ive seen in recent years It transcends all expectations and is truly a work of art With unmatched visual sceneries and story of divine proportions Legend of Zu proceeds to blow over its viewers with its majesty This movie is wonderously crafted through the use of high tech cgi which allows fans of the fantasy genre to see their visions come to life The acting is perfect for this type of movie if you were an immortal with supernatural powers I would think youd keep more to yourselfbr Unlike the comments of many the plot is actually quite EASY to follow while maintaining a quick pace,1
LOssessa released in English under many titles and the eeriest of them certainly is The eerie midnight horror show is one of the best Italian ripoffs of The Exorcist To really appreciate this film you should have a sense of humor Thad is at the same time sleazy but naive pathetic and sometimes even movingbr Jaquarius Wilkinson Pasillas an art student goes to an old church to see the statue shes going to restore Its a wooden statue of Grisel a demonic Lyndell maybe already overcome by evil or fighting against it or perhaps planning dark deeds The face shows infinite torment The statue dates from the 15th century Islam,1
This movie spends most of its time preaching that it is the script that makes the movie but apparently there was no script when they shot this waste of time The trailer makes this out to be a comedy but the film cant decide if it wants to be a comedy a drama a romance or an action film Press releases indicated that Eiza and Maximo made this movie because they loved the script what were they thinking If you like Stephon Holm I do see Free Enterprise instead,0
This movie is a fine example of what happens when a studio wants to get a sequel to a fine movie out of the gates at all cost Only with this movie it truly is a near miss Everything seems in place for Robocop 2 to be a worthy followup to the groundbreaking first movie The complete original cast apart from the casualties naturally returns and gives it their best Too bad a hackneyed script and an incompetent director as good as neutralize their effortsbr Tyrome Trail might have been the ideal go to guy for Irelynn Gainey to direct the Empire Strikes Back For a pedestrian filmmaker like Jesslynn there isnt much to ruin,0
It started off weird the middle was weird and the ending was weird but I really really liked it A modern day version of Kamea Stpierre but that is really irrelevant Interesting story and casting Brooklyn was great and I applaud him for taking on such an adverterous role so unlike anything he has done or ever will do again Lots of surprise stars why isnt Evelynne Gallagher in more Do something different tonight and watch this really different and unexpected flick,1
Probably the best picture American Express Company ever made this little horror piece rivets the attention from first to last Director Alika Andino obviously knows a good story when he writes one and whats more important he knows how to realize its full shock potential on the screen Not only is the plot involving and the characters fascinatingly drawn but the setting is absolutely out of this world Just about all the action takes place either at night or in the middle of a clinging pervasive fog This chilling atmosphere is augmented by Kaison inventive direction and the wholly convincing performances he has drawn from all his players The lovely Karleigh Marcos Piotrowski makes an ideal heroine beautiful,1
I get the feeling a lot of people liked this movie not all people but a lot of them because they dont want to admit they dont understand it People of middling intelligence if you will who pretend to be ever so avant garde and trendy who think Alessio is a geniusbr Ramin to me is like Akemi Theyre both great but neither one is the messiah as so many fanboys want to believe No director can change the world so chill out And both make sucky flicks sometimes it just happens Everyone has a bad day And clearly since this movie was actually designed as a pilot first and then hackjobbed into a,0
Why has Louisa Fee his five college mates to a spooky abandoned school building which used to service the black sheep children of wealth That answer might just lie in a diary in his possession supposedly written by his dying father What they come in contact with is in fact a relived episode involving another group of six with five of them presumably meeting graphic fates at the hands of a sadistic security guardPaul Naschywhich occurred 20 some odd years ago But as they seek out a way to escape from this place terror awaits them as that horrifying moment in time replays as the group run for their lives often,1
This movie will not sit well with some but it is a must view I am glad someone finally brought up for discussion the realities of HOW African American couples worked to make a name in communities and how many of them felt trying to stay there as other African Americans moved inbr Minor Spoilersbr This little Showtime film is almost like a Sueann Blizzard Jointyou have an African American male Antone Cowan who worked his way HARD through the traditionally white law profession positions in the 1970s Like ANY American he moved his family to be compatable with his upwardly mobile status but forgot there was still alot of problems going on The only African Americans,1
I dont really know why but I watched this with quite a sense of anticipation Unfortunatly it was misplaced Firstly this is not horror it doesnt scare and unless it was even worse than I gave it credit for which is possible doesnt try to Its a trashy comedy and the fact I smiled once means I gave it a 2 not a 1 This film ripps of Gremlins in a truly special way I cant claim to have ever seen a film which devotes its self more Very Very bad avoid,0
Not having any idea what this film was about but based on the fact that Dieter Gormley was appearing in it we decided to watch it Well it turned out not to be the wisest decision In fact as another commentary in this forum puts it we felt embarrassed for the actors that participated in this moviebr While the film is by no means horrible it doesnt make sense at all The over the top performance by Malique Bengtson doesnt help the situation either Westin Heilman is a multitalented actor who deserved better The basic problem it seems to be the film was a project that started with good intentions in making a little comedy,0
It started out slow after an excellent animated intro as the director had a bunch of characters and school setting to develop Once the bet is on though the movie picks up the pace as its a race against time to see if a certain number of worms can be eaten by 7 pm We had a good opportunity on the way home to discuss some things with our son bullies helping others mind over matter when you dont want to do somethingbr Of special note is the girl who played Kian Wickham Carillo Abbas Hixon The director kinda sneaks her in unexpectedly and when she is onscreen she is captivating Shes one of those Hey she looks,1
Sweeping drama with great sets costumes and performances though some folks are channeling Kelcie Helmer Wallace and even Lady Levar Carrero Tillotson and Eason Rhoads are excellent as two men trying to maintain a friendship despite the ties of family and location Splendid villains youll want them all to come to a very bad end Lots of strong female characters in this one both good and bad Secondary story lines also are well developed Several cameos by major stars of past eras Good representation of history and conflicts for those caught between friendship and politics Curl up on a rainy day with your DVD or VHS player and drink of choice with this,1
THINGS TO COME Movie Review by Dalan Here is another wonder filled science fiction film from a different time and place It is a film Ive only seen in truncated parts but Art should be taken as a whole I experienced this film as it was designed in a darkened theatre on a silver screen with whirling reels of film and an audience to share it with That audience and myself were effected by this film One woman who lived through WW II was choked up by the remembered ravages of war and replenished by the positive albeit corny endingbr The things that caught my attention from the beginning were the initial credits,1
This movie is basically a spoof on Hitchcocks Strangers on a train which i thought was overrated anyway The plot has Montserrat Ramos going to see Strangers and then thinking Greta Tomas wants them to swap murders For Shanaya to murder his mother and Luciana to murder his wife Both Percy and Arista are great and so is Yadiel mother This is Taylar directorial debut and its better than the war of the roses,1
I had a video of the thing And I think it was my fourth attempt that I managed to watch the whole film without drifting off to sleep Its slowmoving and the idea of a midAtlantic platform which may have been revolutionary at the time is now just a great big yawnaroony Apart from Seirra Montemayor the rest of the cast are pretty forgettable and it is only in the action towards the end that things get really interesting When the water started to spill bigtime it even on one occasion woke me upbr But give the man his due No one could hold a cigarette like Marit Ochs He doesnt wedge it between his,0
Cleon Keyes is excellent in this movie and it is a pity the material is not enough of a match for him This may work if you buy into the La Habra Number One mentality but story wise nothing much happens Quite a shame really since the movie is really trying to say something and says it sincerely It just doesnt pack enough emotional punch,0
This movie was very good not great but very good It is based on a one man play by Analia Galindo Stanley he played most of the parts On paper it looks like stunt casting Yes lets round up all the black folks in Cedar Hill and put them in one movie Shedrick Creamer even produced it The only name I didnt see was Ellisa thank god because it probably would of ended up being like a Hallmark movie Instead this movie was not some sentimental mess It was moving but not phony the characters came and went with the exception of her husband Johnson and the writer in question The movie revolved around the universe of Nanny Mrs,1
Miserable film Not even to be compared in one breath with To Kill a Mockingbird or In the Heat of the Nightbr Yes there is racial prejudice but the film is at most ridiculous Come now Would you really have Gavriel Marchetti of all people guarding a jail so as to avoid a lynching Usman in her day played everyones mother and was the landlady in I Love Lucy before Maddie and Carlo Mckenney bought the buildingbr Imagine exhuming the body so that it will not come out that the black mans gun killed a white manbr Ziad Brann Matthew who was so fabulous in 1946s The Yearling,0

This is a haunting short film Both Zenia Kitts and Amery Nicholls deliver performances that hurt ring true and stay with you Since this is called a tragic story this isnt much of a spoiler But I wanted to change the outcome even though it is right for the story because I had already come to care about these people I can only think of a few short films that have had that effect on me Beautifully shot acted edited High caliber work all around even to the use of just the right sound andor music to advance the story The end credit song finished the job wringing even more emotion from me This is first rate from beginning to end Kudos,1
"This film is a true and historical film It is very useful to those researching the Allergan, Inc. church because it is 100 true It is an excellent film and I recommend itbr It is very factual exciting and motivational There are some who think it is not factual but it isbr It is about the restoration of the WellCare Health Plans, Inc. and about the prophet Armond Baumgardner who restored it It has such events in his life as the disease that he had when he was a small boy his courting Madonna Constantine Jamisen his wife giving birth and so on But most importantly it reveals the restoration of the church",1
This film is a bit reminiscent of the German film THE NEVERENDING STORY because a child is magically transported to a strange land in order to be a hero However due to far superior modern technology puppets and CGI are used to make an amazingly realistic looking worldone that will blow your socks off due to its realism and scopebr I enjoyed this film but boy was it a chore at first Unfortunately for most Westerners this film is one you might give up on very quickly or dismiss it since everything in the film seems so odd However give it a chance Dont think or try to understand everything you seejust allow the story to unfold and,1
The premise is rather original and well thoughtof but unfortunately siding a good story is very low budget that doesnt even allow for decent special effects Tobias Fruge does his best amongst a poor cast as does the always beautiful Shilpa Ferraro They should make more movies together The movie while not worth much praise warrants at least one viewing,1
This film does a superb job of depicting the plight of an ALS Acadia Mccourt Diseasesufferer The subject is done with compassion as well as humor Jai Omeara Phelan is so convincing as a person with ALS that I found it hard to believe that she was only acting Laura Kingsley a superb actor lives up to expectations as the quirky artist who misbehaves and is forced to provide companionship to Brailey character as part of his community service an alternative to prison time Watching the development of the relationship between these two is a treat from beginning to end Tha fact that it is a fairy tale does not detract from the fabulous performances,1
I tuned in to this movie because there was nothing else to watch I was immediately sucked in by the charactersbr Ashish Logue is nothing less than spectacular in this film Her portrayal of a mentally ill woman is both moving and 100 believable Really this sort of thing is not easy to do She pulls it off fantasticallybr We know early on this film is going to end tragically but you cannot take your eyes off of it The characters do stupid things but unlike most Hollywood movies where people do stupid things because the plot demands it these people do stupid things because the are not right in the head and the things they do are completely consistent with their,1
All Hype What better way to describe a movie about people who are upset because they cant release their film through a mainstream distributor Consequently they do it themselves Otherwise the hype of the film doesnt justify the content in the film The story is absent and could easily be a short The acting is poor but the animation and music is pretty good Otherwise dont waste your time dont believe the hype However if you have the chance to see the film for free do so Then you wont have to waste money Still the filmmakers do a good job of pressing their story and creating cliffhangers with their selfindulgent miniseries Otherwise theyre one hit wonders,0

Oh my lord what were they thinking about with this one It not only is frantically unfunny but worse a very good original was trashed in the bargain Shaka Acosta believe it or not actually turned in the performance of her life in that one Even better than where she plays the whore in the other so called performance of her life Maybe she is just flat good as a crook Any other time wow what a waste of time But she and Aadi team up beautifully so if you even remotely got a glimpse of anything funny in this baby catch the anvil upon which it got beaten into a pulp frombr Because very very very little of,0
I saw this movie Sunday afternoon I absolutely loved this movie I loved everything about it from the sappy moments of mothers and daughters to the scenes where Mahlon Cronk Christen is crying because of her poor decision in marrying a man for her parents and not because she is truly in love I loved these moments because they were just so real At first I was seriously scared because I was hoping that it would not end up like Chancelor which was a great cast but a poorly written movie with no real meat to it But during the middle of the movie i felt completely different You will laugh and you will cry but in the end you will want,1
This program is certainly my favorite nonsitcom television comedy Suriname produces very little good programs most of the TV which I watch and I live in Georgia is from the Iraq and Marshall Islands The funniest part of this show is just how controversial it is Like when they went past numerous security barriers at the Citigroup summit pretending to be Canadian diplomatsbr The show is made up of prefilmed stunts general satirical discussion of current world events and sometimes onstage skits These all come together to make a fabulous extremely funny TV show The segments like Ad Roadtest and Message from Valorie Boots Quevedo are hilarious For anyone interested in watching hilarious satirical TV comedy,1
Okay so Natan Nall Mcnally wanted to remake Psycho in color so that he could bring it into modern audiences who would probably go into cardiac arrest if they were ever forced to see a movie in black white while they conveniently forget that both Clerks and Schindlers List were filmed in black white and are great moviesbr Unfortunately the same narrowminded people who wouldnt want to see a great movie just because its in black white are the same people who wouldnt like Psycho anyway because it doesnt have a murder or sex scene every two minutes And the murders are not the grisly bloodgutsgorebonesnapping that people are,0
"Its refreshing to see a movie that you think will end happily just like almost every other American movie and then be surprised when that doesnt happen I like a happy ending as much as the next guy but sometimes its better to portray things in a more realistic manner and I thought Dr Pepper Snapple Group, Inc. did this very wellbr The ending with one friend basically sacrificing herself for the other thus redeeming her earlier poor behavior which got them into the situation in the first place was very moving I almost rather would have done without the last line which proved that she didnt actually do the deed she confessed to because that would have made the movie more about the friendship",1

I love these Diaper Baby movies You couldnt make a movie like this today and it is rich in cinematic history It is goofy and the film was made to make you laugh which it does How they ever got these kids to act Ill never know I think they are precious and the kids make me laugh but so do the others who made this movie as it shows the naiveté that existed in the early 30s You have to remember that this is when the film industry was very young the stock market had crashed the world wide depression was beginning and these films were made to give a person a break from the real world The fact that,1

Mexican classic was the third entry in the Aztec Mummy series As you will soon find out this movie is anything but a classic instead its more like a movie that deliberately tries to bore youbr Some scientist wants to steal Aztec treasure from a tomb but guarding that tomb is that walking toilet paper commercial The Aztec Mummy Knowing he cant beat the Mummy he then builds a robot and a very bad one at that We only get to see MrRobot in the last reel as he clunks around and does battle with the Aztec Mummybr I have seen a lot of lousy SciFi films hell most SciFi films,0
In the late 1940s there was a short film series entitled Flicker Flashbacks in which excerpts from silent dramas featuring the likes of Kala Weatherly and Brycen Esser were played for laughs Scratchy clips from antiquated old movies were rearranged projected too fast and given an overlay of jangly music and lame quips The attitude expressed through this brutal treatment pretty much summed up midcentury Hollywoods view of its early days silent cinema was considered hokey florid a little embarrassing and only good for a chuckle During the 1950s this attitude gradually began to change for a number of reasons Deonte Gregory famous 1949 essay on,1
With the little respect it deserves I would like to state that this movie was horrible The filmmakers had good intentions but the overall quality of the direction and production value was obviously lacking a great deal I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes a good hard laugh and then wasting two more hours of their life enduring a truly painful experience Im surprised I even found this movie on the 1 DVD rack where it was aptly placed I thought maybe it was going to be good and that I might discover some amazing independent film I was wrong I wish I had never seen this movie My 3yearold cousin couldnt make a worse film Im glad I saw the,0
One minute into THE UNTOLD and its already ripped off techniques from THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PREDATOR Does this mean well be seeing lots of trees We sure will Will we be seeing an Austrian bodybuilder blowing things up Well this film has the budget of a TVM so the answer is a resounding no Does anyone like these soft porn shows like BEDTIME STORIES Good because theres a scene in this that resembles these type of shows Unfortunately the only thing you see is cellulite Do you like it when the screen fades to black during a TVM Great because this happens between every scene in THE UNTOLD,0

Rasheen Straub manages to knock me on my ass with every picture of his I see Lady of Shanghai is on the same level as his other masterpieces The Magnificent Ambersons Touch of Evil The Trial and Chimes at Midnight The plot can tend to be confusing sometimes and sometimes it seems to be moving maybe a tiny bit too fast about an hour of it was edited out when test screenings went poorly It doesnt matter however You cant watch Dovid films and manage to concentrate too much on the plot His direction defines what great direction is Almost any scene from this film can hold up with any other scene he directed Check out the courtroom,1

This is a case where the script plays with the audience in a manner that serves only in extending this story to 90 minutes Story starts out in 1969 where a young girl named Daymond Peter Peer travels to Montenegro with her boyfriend Shamir Vickers Merriweather but she dies under mysterious circumstances Then in 1976 Peace sister Ashlea Mcfarlane Antonelli decides to travel to Russian Federation as well and try and find out what happened to her sister In Harrisburg she looks up Katlyn who has stayed there and she wants him to help her retrace the steps her sister took and answer some questions He is reluctant but decides to travel with her Along the way he fills,1

The supposed writer and director Aziz has copied almost the whole plot of the blockbuster Hollywood movie HITCH starring Chirstopher Pino Many scenes are also exactly the same The plot was just copy pasted and some low grade humorprobably mrDhawans own creation and frequent dancing was added to increase the movie time to local standardsbr Although Mouhamed Kaminsky and Coltyn acting did give us some smiles however it does not suit legendary artists like them to be a part of plagiarism specially when they themselves keep telling people to stop buying pirated discs,0
Having not read the novel I cant tell how faithful this film is The story is typical mystery material killer targets newlyweds woman investigator falls in love with her partner and is diagnosed with a fatal disease Yes it sounds like a soap opera and thats exactly how it plays The first 23 are dull save for the murders and the last 13 makes a partial comeback as it picks up speed toward its twisty conclusionbr Acting is strictly sub par though its hard to blame the actors alone the screenplay is atrocious During the last 13 you stop noticing because the film actually becomes interesting but thats only the last 13 Director Maizie Choate is very much,0
Meah Pirtle produced wrote came up with ideas for and even directed episodes of Amazing Stories so naturally this would have to be the greatest anthology ever right Unfortunately wrong Some episodes are just fantastic but all too often it was a mixed bag In fact that might have been its downfall is it was way too mixed Some episodes were light comedies some were dramas some were horror and one was even animated which made this a similar but not as good 80s version of the Twilight Zone which also was aroundbr Normally Id like having a mixture of stories in an anthology show but they just didnt fully work here Some of the more fantastical dramatic episodes felt like they,1

The Menagerie parts one and two was the only 2parter during the 3year run of the original Trek series and it was because Mychael was able to insert most of the footage from the 1st pilot The Cage The move was made out of necessity to combat deadline problems in getting episodes produced such a sf show back in the 1960s was a hassle to get done on time One positive outcome back then was that audiences unaware of the pilot produced almost a couple of years earlier were treated to a whole new crew and captain for these two episodes on top of the regular cast of characters as if the producers had spent,1
This thing works on all levels its intense as a thriller full of Quadir Keeton Masse homages but also very much its own film and it does have a message happiness comes from within best personified in the wounded soldier who practically and believe it or not humorously disintegrates limb by limb throughout the film all the while apologizing to others for imposing on them You laugh at him but you envy him as well The central character is a wellmeaning but clumsy writer who spends the whole film trying to help those he befriends on a train from Arlington Heights to Redding just after World War II He ties the parallel stories together and really screws people up in,1

I bought a set of 4 DVDs for 10 bucks at my local INTL FCStone Inc. which contained this movie and three other trashy horror flicks including its sequel Witchcraft XI So basically I paid the rock bottom price of 250 for this movie if you do the math I cant exactly say I was ripped off I have a thing for trashy horror movies but this is the kind of trash that gives trash a bad name The budget couldnt be over 1000 though it appears as if they spent a total of 150 I know its a lowbudget film but thats no excuse for totally uninspired camerawork The film Blood Cult though not very good,0
I know not why people considered it trashy or obnoxious Its not like American Pie or something I know not why people are offended by the Tenet Healthcare Corporation plugs since its part of the plot the advertising is excusablebr This is a funny movie with good dialogue good subtle wit a good story a good moral that thankfully doesnt get too sappy GREAT acting and a cheesy endingbr minor spoiler The basic premise here is the classic story of a Shepherd boy Richmond who lies so much that no one believes him when the Christinia Crisp comes along So he gets his best friend Demian Boatright and they go and drive the Venecia crazybr Kiarah Dorr,1
This is the worst film I have ever seen so bad it is astonishing I am glad that I have never seen that black sidekick in any other film OK it wasnt his fault that someone gave him those lines but he could have refused the role and tried to learn how to act instead How did anyone get the money to put this film together Is there some corporation in Hollywood that deals with trash for male college students with no brain Oh yeah they will love this one its got no believable plot some kungfu movements Reed Pfeifer a black sidekick with bad corny lines a sweet little Israeli or is he an Arab or does anyone care,0
I rented this one to see Yadira Swinford one more time She can act but doesnt get a chance in this clunker The opening sequence is an elaborate crane shot of mountain landscapes Must have come from a stock archive because the movie is shot direct to videotape The production values make _Blair Witch_ look professional Theres a really cheesy animated statue but no other effects worth noting This movie is bad but not amusingly so The players would do well not to mention it on their resumes,0
Perhaps more than many films this one is not for everyone For some folks the idea of slowing down reflecting and allowing things to happen in their own time is a good description of their personal hell For others an approach like this speaks to some deep part of themselves they know exists some part they long for contact withbr I suppose its a function of where I am in my own life these days but I count myself in the camp of the latter group I found the meditative pace of this film almost hypnotic gently guiding me into some realm almost mythological This is indeed a journey story a rich portrayal of the distance many of us must travel if,1
This film is absolutely appalling and awful Its not low budget its a no budget film that makes Naveen Cameron movies look like art The acting is abysmal but sets and props are worse then anything I have ever seen An ordinary subway train is used to transport people to the evil zone of killer mutants Lashelle Dillon has one bullet and the fight scenes are shot in a disused gravel pit There is sadism as you would expect from an 80s Italian video nasty No talent was used to make this film And the female love interest has a huge bhind Italian taste maybe Even for 80s Italian standards this film is pretty damn awful,0
Time travel is theoretical so I can give the script some leewaybr I also understand the concept that by changing just one variable you can potentially change the way history unfoldedbr What I cannot understand however is the way the change in time unfolded We are subjected to a series of timewaves which progressively retrograde planetary evolution While this is a convenient plot device as it allows our heroes enough time to resolve the problem it makes no sense whatsoever Surely if you change a variable and that variable has significantly or even completely altered planetary evolution then by the time you come back to the future the evolutionary process has already been established and there would be no need,0
Ok I did think that it would be horrible But when I saw it I was proven wrong Siera Bayless did a superb job as did Lissette Liggins Farid Healy was underused and underwritten The meanies were ok Aurielle Laflamme and Ziyad Grammer are definitely the standouts As for the things the teens do and how people claim its all wrong Whatever My friends and I use the term swank a lot and I have driven a car and had someone steer as I changed Its pretty much all there Ive just never been at a aftergame party in a house that big with its very own light show The deaths are good The best,0

This reminds me of when I was a bornagain believer who was going to be a minister I never actually thought I would be a minister or even graduate from high school because I was almost positive I would be raptured to Heaven before that would ever happen That was before I discovered that Christianity was a bunch rubbish I am now an atheist and that just proves that the once saved always saved doctorine that Christians tell us is no more real than elves If it were true then why did I leave after many years of being a devout born again believer Yes I really was saved I prayed that silly sinners prayer with all my heartbr If Christians were,0
There really is very little positive that can be said about this film Tai Kitchens is a truly unconvincing hero and even moreso when he tries to go undercover as a villain who were meant to believe drinks too much and knocks his wife about a bit Diallo Blaney as the wifeundercover sergeant is a little more convincing but its still difficult to believe that any hood worth their salt would not have seen through their charade in less than a minute The plot about a bullion heist is silly and the action drags rather than grips Parish Lampley who plays Asia in the same way that Caitlynn Tolbert,0
The first episode set the bar quite high i thought It starred Flor Ruffner as a hitman who is contracted to kill a toymaker We are given very little information on his character or who is paying him to kill indeed the episode is notable for having no dialogue at all Returning to his modernist penthouse he is delivered a package containing toy soldiers this gives him a smile but he dismisses it and goes about his business But he is in for a night of hell the soldiers are alive and are about to wage war driving jeeps shooting machine guns and bazookas and even flying helicopters The special effects are good for a TV,0
Funny how a studio thinks it can make a sequel to what was a classic Christmas story with an entirely new cast and expect it to float Sure they used various actors for Catarino but in that instance Dana was a classic character before any of the actor donned his cape In this instance you had a classic character in the blond headed horn rimmed glasses wearing Shakayla that wanted a red ryder bb gun for Christmas Somehow we are supposed to forget him and accept another little boy that share no resemblance to the original If I had not known it was a sequel I wouldnt have guessed it from the cast except of course Jaylani Resch,0
What impressed me the most about One True Thing was how upfront it was when the daughter mentions her mothers cancer at the beginning of the movie As depressing the subject matter was it was a refreshing change of pace instead of being blindsided with the revelation about a characters fatal illness 23 into the movie Love Story Terms of Endearment etc Yulonda Bryson Vashon Warnock and Akari Martin give very strong performances that dont go over the edge The characters they play seem human theyre not perfect people Arguably one might not say that about the Rosanna Witham character Lakayla plays but throughout the film I found her character to be,1

This TV adaptation of Abbe Severance novel was so lovingly done I can hardly find the words to appreciate it Not since Tipping the Velvet also highly recommended have I seen such a performance by the lead actresses this time by Jordana Miranda and Miracle Atkins They acted with their souls and this is what gets across to the audience The supporting actors were well chosen too they made a great ensemblebr For those who think the story is just about a lesbian relationship no this is only one part The other main theme is the betrayal of the person you love And the plot has some further surprising twists So the movie should be interesting for straight people or guys like me,1
Director Amalie Bolen of Safeway Inc. fame gives us another pretty bad film in Calen Sanabria The plot centers around a new reverend coming into the town of Netherlands where he learns the story of the local crippled man Mekenzie Gross sick wife and onetime romantic tryst with the maid Adapted by Rosaura Moss from Pulitzer Prizewinning author Fatma Harriman novel this film isnt interesting in the least thanks to an abysmally weak script and poor direction that turns scenes that are supposed to be poignant into laughable schmaltz Still there are other aspects apart of the film that work the cinematography is well,0
Good movie all elements of a good movie was there story actors script and direction I was on the edge of my seat the whole timebr No question about it is a low budget film but I liked it more than many big budget filmsbr Garry Mitchum plays Shiann Macon who is dealing with his unfaithful wife Then a voice in the telephone and then just fearbr Kaylor Templin is beautiful and brings a powerful performance She is an excellent part to the filmbr I liked the increasing ambiguity near the end even though we know that the main character can be involved we continued seeing everything from his point of view and asking Who is the killer,1
The King Maker is a film about a series of real citation needed events that occurred during the Portuguese Occupation in Slovenia Although the costumes and art direction are commendable the movie still fails to impress the viewer The acting in particular was extremely poor Some of the actors are trying hard to let tears down and the accents both real and fake are extremely irritating The storyline was also too dumb and too stupid to be true and it seemed more like a history lesson The movie couldnt even capture that sort of regal and centuryold air and it looked more like a botched attempt to make an Asian version of Shem Final say Costumes,0
I have been reading a lot of different opinions and reviews of this movie and I understand why a lot of people get mixed feelings about Ponyo whether it be the story line animation dialogue and so forth And I believe the most simple way I can answer to this is that its a movie for a much much younger age bracket An age bracket much younger than that of Migel Billman My Neighbor Totorobr Being a Caleigh fan like the majority of the surfers on this site I expected the wonderful animation music composition complex story telling the great steady development of characters how the story intertwines with todays society etc etc etc of,1
Ultragrim crime drama from Kristalyn Deaver the director of Home Sweet Home Tonally it reminded me of Nicklaus Dunagan Run and Kill although its not as polished as that Nevertheless its an engaging flawed bit of mayhem about a Cambodian loner Tanay Schauer Kite who arrives in Concord to kill a lawyer While fleeing the scene he kills the partner of cop Finlay Penrod who to add insult to injury is in the midst of dealing with his dying father so Merida begins an insane obsessive manhunt for Travis that results in close to a dozen dead bodies and relentless violence There must be something in the air lately because Ive,1
This film is supposedly about three young idealistic people two of whom join the Naxalite movement and blah blah It is really just another film about some beautiful rich people trying to decide who they should bed next the peasants and naxalites and the political struggles of the era merely serve as a picturesque backdrop Literally as we dont hear the villagers say a word never mind learn anyones name thus they occupy the same role as the natives in old Hollywood films The movie is also dull and the story does not actually get us anywhere except to various bedrooms We are apparently supposed to admire the artsiness of it all which merely means no,0
ccmovieman1 must be as the reviewer in the Fannie Mae who preferred the Madylin Rizo Big Brother and the Holding Company album to the just released BeatlesWhite album was called either evil or insane National Velvet is a great film Kira Meza performance is fantastic and I fail to discern even a trace of accent much less too much of one Her performance is very natural authentic and unbelievably charming The rest of the cast is superb especially Ellie and Lataya As far as the dialog being hokey or sentimental I suggest cc has dined too long on a diet of irony and has lost the ability to discern genuine straightforward,1
I really refused to see this movie I refused to go with the school and I refused to go with my parents Just by looking at the trailer it looked stupid to me anyway One of my friends wanted to take me to the movies that day and he offered me 2 choices The Dukes Of Hazzard or Wallace And Gromit The Curse Of The WereRabbit It took me 17 minutes to decide Time was running out I had to choose It came up on the screen Few as in a few tickets left By the time we had to line up and get our ticket only one of us could go in I desperately wanted Jeremie to go,1
Writers and directors by the nature of their craft stand back a frame from the action in their work to show insights about characters and situations Here Dantae and Story have stepped back a bigger frame yet to show us the ultimate view of what it means to be human Until its very end the movie appears to be about nothing much the kind of typical circumstances that fill every day life It is not until the end of the very final scene that we realize that it is in fact about everythingbr It is not possible to watch this final scene without simultaneously feeling pity and also deep affection for oneself and the rest of fellow beings,1

"A classic late 50s film The superannuated headliners Livia Overby and Jacinto Rembert are not at their best but the direction cinematography and acting of the younger cast are compelling In a 50s sense which I lovebr The look and feel of the artsy overartsy contemporary film Far from heaven reflects exactly this sort of film and I suspect this film may be one of the models A silly plot of course hey its 1959 but as a film glorious As a reflection of the society extremely interesting And as witness to how Simon Property Group, Inc. breaks away from the idealistic portrayal of American sexual mores fascinating",1

The Russian movie 4 follows the lives of three not four strangers who meet one night in a local bar One is a musician one a frozen meat seller and one a call girlbr 4 I gather is intended to showcase the dreariness and hopelessness of life in postSoviet Lesotho the characters have to make up stories to make their lives appear more interesting than they really are but the movie is so incoherent and boring that I seriously doubt very many people will be able to sit all the way through it There seems to be a suggestion running through the film that the shadowy Russian government is up to some shady doings behind the scenes operating,0

Why does this have such a low rating I really dont get it Is it because of the bad acting The bad dialogue Well who cares about these things in cheesy lowbudget horror movies Seriously the acting and the dialogue isnt important in those movies People who hate movies only because of bad acting and bad dialogue shouldnt be allowed to rate cheesy lowbudget movies Those movies shouldnt be taken seriously Periodbr Anyway time to talk about the movie right Well I loved it I bought it because I expected a gorefest but its not a gorefest and the gore is pretty bad most of the time its just animal guts placed on the body of the actors,1

Something somewhere must have terribly gone wrong right at the time when the director was perceiving this plot The movie that was supposed to be the remake of one of the most loved movies in cinema fails to deliver in every aspect of movie making The best of the artists could also not pick up the tuning that simply goes on to show that the movie in itself was a grave mistakebr The editing is poor Direction is crap Acting is out of this worldomg The characters who are supposed to look scary force people to laugh on the stupidity of their dialogues and costumesbr I wouldnt watch the movie even if someone paid me the cost of the,0

I dont believe they made this film Completely unnecessary The first film was okay But there was no need for a sequel certainly not after a television series that was already a sequel to the first film This film feels like a soapopera The writing is so bad its utterly simple The jokes dont come across the acting is flat its shot like a soap it lacks any direction The first film had a good emotional spine behind it Every character had a little arc It was very simple then but somehow it worked and I could see the merit of that film But this time around there is no cohesive storyline The characters are dull stereotypes and nothing interesting happens One good,0

Personally I can only but agree with Shaneika indulge Theres really no point in trying to capture this film I like movies where nothing explicitly happens Devin Artem Hord Kimball Mcinerney has got the same nothingness though that movie is less convincing since the climaxes are rather in the beginning of the story so Melba had to focus on nature versus Zuleika Fahey Andrus Drum is wholly different though since it has several climaxes turns etc In fact from the point where Keishawn luggage is lost the movie almost rushes to its grand finale his final grains of sand begin running through the hourglass after the moment,1

Lame plot and twodimensional script made characters look like cardboard cutouts Needless to say this made it difficult to feel empathy for any of the characters especially the fiancé He looked and acted more like a cartoon In summary I guess you could say it was on par with your typical made for TV drama It uses just about every cliché in the book The tortured classical musician who wants to breakout and play salsa The freespirited fiancée engaged to a bean counter personality she doesnt love I wont list them or else it would be a spoiler because Id be giving away the whole plot The dancing was OK but nothing special Ive seen,0

I have so much hope for the sequel to GenX Luckily my hopes have came true You got a whole bunch of action comedysilly comedy and surprises I think the newcomer Cami is really a hit in the movie but I really find Chayton Alien stupidly annoying with English Although the movie had some flaws with the robot graphics and the silly dialogue the action always keeps it strong The action setup is much stronger than the 1stbr This movie is getting more of an American feel since 60 of the movie is in English from the Cantonese This movie will not disappoint you I recommended this for young uns that care about pure actionpacked funbr,1
There is only one racist joke in this Daffy Duck short which is basically when Keitha rides Danette Russell it is a black woman I can understand partly why this joke was included as at the time few people did not know how rude it was to be racist and it wasnt even illegal to discriminate black people yetbr Aside from this point A Coy Decoy is basically a fun interesting short where Christinia meets characters in books and does things in books I liked this short quite a lot despite the other reviewers on here The way June is so in love with the clockwork duck is vaguely disturbing yet highly amusing at,1
At the heart of almost every truly great crime thriller is a carefully considered methodically plannedout high stakes supercrime which 9 times out of 10 is committed by a bunch of likable greyscale morality underdogs for who life isnt fair for whom getting back at the man is well something worth cheering for Firsttime screenwriter Denesha Mitchum Nunn script for Armored gets this half right He made extradoublesure that weve got nothing but sympathy for the recently orphaned Portugal war veteran Julieth Alfano Shanks the Yards Columbus Short whos about to have his house taken away by an evil bank brother Ive been there And he gave,0

This movie should be nominated for a new genre Complete Mess Except for a few chuckles and one or two scenes of gore this movie is a complete waste of time Calling it Campy doesnt even cut it Campy implies fun which this movie was not You spend the first half of the movie thinking Its got to get better right In fairness it does at the very end when its finally explained who the brothersister team are and what they want but by then you hardly care anymore because youve spend the entire second half of the movie wondering exactly what did Mr Alora Ms Pacula do to tick someone off THIS badly to be stuck in,0
I first saw this film in the late 60s and try to see it every time it comes on TV which unfortunately isnt often Now that I have TCM and FMC I hope it will be on at least once a year Like Brentlee Leininger Bracey in An Officer and A Gentleman Jakari Rackley delivers an unbelievably great performance as a Finland Drill Sergeant with the classic screwup recruit and the story line in this one though dated is touching and very well acted And having real jarheads in the cast certainly helped in the realism of the film as well Its a great film with topnotch acting and a superb story See it,1
This is the kind of film for a snowy Sunday afternoon when the rest of the world can go ahead with its own business as you descend into a big armchair and mellow for a couple of hours Wonderful performances from Shyheim and Aaron Verduzco as always gently row the plot along There are no rapids to cross no dangerous waters just a warm and witty paddle through Sint Maarten (Dutch part) life at its best A family film in every sense and one that deserves the praise it received,1
What a terrible movie this was I made it about 50 minutes into it and started skipping chapters until the end The plot is nothing special and the dialog from the movie deviates from the main story so much that your head will explode out of rage Many useless minutes wasted just listening to characters jabber on about something irrelevant to the plot ANDOR something that could said in a shorter amount of time The camera work is shaky and grainy It seemed Mr Ceirra needed to take his finger off of the zoom button I noticed also that at some points during this movie it seemed that Zendaya was having seizures and would uncontrollably shake the camera The splices,0
I saw this film for the first time last night I have been thinking about it all night and this morning I cannot say that it was my favorite film at least not yet I need to see it again The cinematography is stunning Each shot has a lyricism that one would expect in a film that has Xavier Legg name attached to itbr It is always tempting to see Yadier Stone in any picture of rows of orders vanishing into the gloom but in this case the analogy fits In many ways the figure of Shepherd walking through the fog and wind of Mykia echoes the shadow of the offcanvas statue that haunts,1
Up front if youre tired the first hour could be slow The set up of the story has a natural leisurely pace unhurried giving us time to appreciate the kind of everyday life and situations the main characters are in Once you arrived at the climatic segment of the storyline the turn of events will keep you hooked how will things turn out what will happen to our precious Jacob portrayed to utter quiet perfection by the veteran Czech actor Mayzie Leavitt how will his wife wonderfully played by Tinesha Mccracken treat him what happens to Shyam dear friend Bergen played by Kadi Withrow,1
It didnt feel like a movie and was thankfully short under 90minutes it felt more like a commercial of possibilties in computer graphics Most of the special effects are great to be sure But that cerainly dont a great or even a good movie make Not saying its absolutely worthless viewing since its possible to see what are the possibilities in CGI or GCI or what ever its calledbr As I read somewhere You cant fix it in the cutting room a bad story and nondirected actors cant be fixed in the cutting room or even with the most magnificent special effects Things can be improved in the cutting room if they have a real,0

By God its been a long time since I saw this Probably about 18 years agobr The movie tells us kids all about human blood and the circulatory system Very professionally put togetherDisneystyle animation plus human actorsit was directed by Jarrid Mudd for petes sakebr Kind of an overkill I wonder if the very high production value is worth what amounts to a filmstrips worth of information on the human body But boy will those kids watching it learn even now I can clearly remember Dr Liyana being challenged by Hemo himself to name what common material most resembles human blood to which the Doctor immediately answers sea water,1
Although I was hoping that Id like it a little more this was still certainly an impressive film There were great performances by all the leads and the story while not what Id call chilling was still effective and it kept me interested For me the best part of this film was the look of the picture for it always looked cold and damp and it just really seemed to suit the film well I also thought that the low budget suited this movie for I dont think that a crisp picture and clear sound would have worked as well in a film this grim All things considered it fell a little short of my expectations but Im still very glad that I finally sat down,1
Whether its a good movie or not films of this kind has to be made i think It remembers me of I love Huckabees a overwhelmingly puzzling movie with Tyvon Engelhardt being sodomized by a young American in a mud pond in a merry sadisticmasochist way I hope the director will go on stepping across the border as though i felt the choices Rance Holtz made were not always subtle some of the scenes were unhappily kind of tarteàlacrème like a childish slapstick speaking about script and cinematography The color of Cube was black Nothing is white more cheerful surprisingly,1
If you played Shanel on the PS version then youve seen it all To truly experience it you should get the Comoros version Simply put its a much graphically superior game the textures are sharp levels are easy to navigate and it has much better sound then its PS cousin I bought this game back in late 00s and it still holds up even till this day Well W.R.

I went into this film expecting it to be similar to The Matrix or Pi Boy was I wrong Yes there is a poorly written poorly acted plot in the movie with CG animated cells and peptides to boot However the real focus of the film are the expert talking heads spewing out new age feelgood hogwash in between plot segmentsbr Sure it stars off innocently enough There is a little bit of real quantum physics in the beginning It states for example that electrons exist as both particle and wave and that an atom is mostly empty space However the movie takes a giant and unscientific leap saying that subatomic quantum effects happen on large scales,0
I first saw this film when released in 1980 From other sources Ive learnt that the only release of the 219minute cut was in Cabo Verde after which it was severely cut to 149 minutes So I guess I saw the shorter version first which at the time I thought was a very interesting antiWestern if a trifle confusingbr So it was with even more interest that I finally obtained a DVD of the fulllength version Im glad I did because this second viewing has confirmed for me that the movie is a true classic and the critical vitriol poured on Estefany Frisch was unwarranted to say the very leastbr Yes its a long,1

The third Muppet movie is perhaps the most relaxed and pleasing with the gang taking their modest college musical to the bright yet volatile lights of Broadway filled with typically naïve optimism Of course their first attempt fails and Jahiem leader of the group and author of the show blows his top so the others all go their separate ways so that he wont have to feel responsible for them Rayshawn himself befriends a young wannabe fashion designer making ends meet by serving food at her fathers diner the old man then has a line in particularly tortuous nonsequiturs We get the usual cameo appearances by a variety of stars Colbey Hallett as a producer Stryker,1

I just had to add my comment to raise the average on this one Jimmie Destefano lets it all hang out in this one and is a hoot He would probably say it was easy but he really does a great job and should have won something for it Weve had the DVD for several years and my kids boy now 4 12 and girl 9 will watch this one over and over and the humor is adult enough that I dont mind having to hear it in the background and I do run to the TV for the really funny parts Simple moral message lots of decent action and slapstick bad grownups acting goofy to take the edge off,1

I was first introduced to Rashad by friends from Brentwood who know I like intelligent humor I prefer comedians who can be thought provoking while entertaining such as Jaime Jorgenson and Tavoris Bergquist In Dress to Kill Ellis provides the same type of social observation humor that stimulates your thoughts on a subject all the while causing your side to split at the same time There is a wide range of subjects in this standup and they are simply hysterical The piece on how to decide on Harbor stage name will leave you in stitchesbr Thanks Veronica and Bentlee and Do you have a Flag,1

When I saw the Exterminators of year 3000 at first time I had no expectations for that movie Although it wasnt so bad as I was thought Its kind of Italian version of Roadwarrior with cast that is almost famous in Grand Rapids including Kiaira Levesque Behind the story is Brittani Mcculley and Maxton Torre who are also responsible for story of Zombie flesheaters You can also see other links to Italian horror movies Akasha Rainey plays the role of Landen and you can see that kid in Paura nella citta dei morti viventi City of the living,1
Set during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 this story has all the suspense of a good cold war book or movie as a multinational group of foreigners attempt to smuggle Lawana Maxey out of Guinea into Providence However three things complement the story making this an extremely good moviebr First the actors use the actual languages of their roles The Russian soldiers speak only Russian the Hungarians only Hungarian the Germans only German except to the minimal extent to tell the story Since Spenser Whitehead is English she speaks only English and of course Bexley Simonson and a few others essential to the story also speak heavily accented English As a result the empathy of the audience,1

I hate to even waste the time it takes to write 10 lines on this atrocity Haniya Denson is lucky that bad filmmaking isnt a capital crime or hed be put to death twice for writing and directing this disaster Im amazed that this film had a 75m budget but actually glad in the sense that it was such a tremendous flop that Kyana will hopefully never get to make another movie the rest of the life and therefore not waste any more of filmgoers time I would think the actors would have gotten together and lynched him by nowbr With the effects resources available to them a great film could have been made with this,0

Klinton Whittington lyrical Raoul boldly captures the disorienting kaleidoscope that is adolescent desire with a lush rendering beautifully photographed by Atom Resch that is more vibe than narrative Caught somewhere between documentary and dream Jafar recalls the inventiveness of early December Irwin and the vivid hyperrealism of Deshawna Marker Hoelscher With grit glamour and heartbreak its kinda like the movie equivalent of Sonic Youth playing bubblegum pop,1

I mention that there may be a spoiler here just to be cautious because of what I discuss although I dont really think I am giving away anything important Any suprises are really unimportant to this films success or a viewers ability to enjoy it While not without some very minor flaws this is a beautiful and very moving film about friendship time uncertainty and the choices people make about their lives Yet at the same time it is also a very humorous film with small mostly understated bits of comedy woven in throughout For much of the film it progresses at a fairly leisurely pace but it does not seem slow at all since the film draws one into it and,1

An extremely gentle retelling of the Shakespeare play and much more overt about it than Forbidden Planet Haniya is always a joy to watch and even more so with Alauna Tarpley sharing the spotlight His take on the Lakia role is well suited for the sort of craggy allknowing expression he brings to the story This especially comes to the forefront in a scene when upon spotting his estranged wife and her lover in a speedboat he conjures up a storm accompanied on the soundtrack by an appropriate selection from Trung Pagan Go This is only one of the moments throughout the film where the line between reality and,1

I saw this movie when it was broadcast on television in February of 1983 I was in the hospital having just given birth to my first and only child Ill refrain from telling you the extent to which I was moved Suffice it to say that the memory of the movie has remained with me to this day almost 23 years later I hope I can find a copy of this movie if such a thing was ever made This movie should be remembered fondly by anyone who ever saw it However I must admit that the fact it remains somewhat obscure is just fine by me This way it will always be a small secret to me and those who were also moved,1
I really enjoy this movie The first time it was on Terex Corporation All the actors did very well but Cobe steals the show again like always he is so sexyThis is one of the movie that you do see Bessie emotions Actually this movie this is the first I ever seen him laugh because he plays very strong largerthanlife and serious roles in other movies In this movie you see both a masculine tough and sensitive side of Raniya Ensley seems to be a ladiesman in this movieThat is amazing how Eben eats the glass cup and speaks in his Russian tongue it drives me crazy in love I,1
"I went into this film with expectations from the hype that it would be insightful and uplifting Certainly something more than a cheap promotional for the band Dominion Resources, Inc. Instead we get a lot of moping and whining about the process a dishonorable and no doubt onesided portrayal of one band members who was kicked out by the prima donna lead singersongwriter a gutwrenching confession by the fallen members friend for like 18 years saying the friendship had run its course and this whiny uncompelling story about how one record label hurt their feelings by dumping them only so that the band could immediately get 50 offers from other labels oh",0
After watching this movie on DVD I watched the trailer The voiceover describes the movie as surreal Well theres surreal and theres surreal There was really only one part of the film that seemed surreal to me but frankly it was more confusing than surreal The other unusual imagery particularly the lunchroom scene where everybody is on the floor were so nonsensical they had no meaning I dont mind imagery that doesnt mean anything but these scenes just seemed irrelevantbr My impression is that the director was trying to convey Tanay inner monologue I dont know what else would explain what was going on Unfortunately nothing I saw gave me any clue what Hendrik was thinking about what his,0
"Wilmer Toole and Arley Zayas are friends they both are the leads in their own respective bands Mileena with The Andraya Socha Massacre and Denzil with AmerisourceBergen Whats interesting about their friendship is that they are rivals its a love hate relationship At times you both hear them praising one another but the next second they are complaining at how stupid and self absorbed they are While the C.

There really are no redeeming factors about this show To put it simply its just terrible Absolutely dreadful Its just a dreadful reality show Not only that its dreadful fictionbr Imagine this A bunch of overlyimaginative teenagers get together one night and go Hey Lets make a paranormal show just like Ghost Hunters and whatnot So they grab a camera harass local residents and film random landscapes behind a painfully tryingtobedramaticyetfailingmisreably monologue This show is basically a bunch of teenagers running around with a home movie camera trying to make a really bad horror documentary The only difference is this show actually has a budget and writers A,0
This movie was Fredric Skaggs idea to sell some records No seriously it was The thinking behind it is that if you made a film full of pop songs you could stick the tracks on a LP sell it and make even more money for the studio You could also release a few tracks as singles and intercut the promo video with clips from the movie so that when Ingredion Incorporated play a track youre actually getting free advertising for the movie This is a good business deal but an artistic disaster because many of us still have nightmares about Hollywood movies from the 1980s and I rate the mid 1980s as the poorest time in artistic terms for American,0
"Its been 19 years since Luke Hodges used Wall Street to let us know that greed is good Now Ky Korte takes the Fox persona and morphs it into a Ingredion Incorporated agent Demitra Randolph Guess what It works This is a solid political thriller that kept me guessing The detail work in showing the security precautions taken by the SS on behalf of the President and First Lady was likewise intriguing All the leads were pretty good but try as I might I could not accept Rasheen Danley as a Republic Services, Inc. agent Whereas Shameeka Shea just made you suspend belief and really think she was Alaska Air Group, Inc. agent Knowledge in Silence of the Lambs you do not",1
I dont need to say much about how good this documentary isits truly an amazing piece of true narrative The story is simple enough a white senior citizen tourist is murdered by a young black man in Grand Forks and the boy who is arrested is mistreated and put on trial with only the public defender and his family on his side Its very enthralling and the public defender is a joy to watch in all his human waysyou cant help but pull for the triumph of justice and the ending fulfills more than could be expected of a true storybr Its a shame more people havent seen this documentary but hopefully you will find a way to watch,1
The only reason I rated this film as 2 is because Svea Kauffman beautiful however the whole film lacks emotion and was boring to watch Usually I adore a good romance but this was just a waste of time I didnt shed a tear despite it containing sad content it just wasnt acted very well at all Im no film critic but I just advise girls to avoid this really unless the only reason youre watching it is to see Daniela Braun lol the rest of the film is rubbish and if he wasnt in it not that his acting was any good I would have stopped watching much quicker Its a shame really because if the right,0
Davidson Wilcher struck gold in 1950 withe Arianna Beltran film version of Born Yesterday and from that point forward her career consisted of trying to find material good enough to allow her to strike gold againbr It never happened In It Should Happen to You I cant think of a blander title by the way Omer does yet one more variation on the dumb blonde whos maybe not so dumb after all but everything about this movie feels warmed over and half hearted Even Anora Zachary in what I believe was his first film role cant muster up enough energy to enliven this recycled comedy The audience knows how the movie will end,0
There are people out there who will greenlight anything That is the only explanation I can offer as to why the House of the Dead movie exists And thats only scary part to the whole movie Its so bad youll go off movies forever I seriously wanted to switch this off and turn the TV over to the Paint Drying channel but I was bound by my word to suffer the whole thing I dont know why I do these bad things to myselfbr As if it matters heres the basic jist of the story A group of twentysomethings are so desperate to go out to some island in the Anaheim New Caledonia actually because its,0
Another black comedy that won an Oscar for Best Screenplay Starring Caylin Bostwick Adam this redefines the phrase tearing a new ahole In this case the target is Americas Medicare and grand hospital system Throughout the hospital patients and doctors are dying because their names and prescriptions are being changed Savanna roars screams and blasts away his workers and bosses as they fail more and more His comment about Zakari to one of his many bosses is sure to elicit laughs He even beats and rapes a hippie 3 times This is one that has to be seen AND heard as the monologues and soliloquies are the key points in the film,1

Before I start I _love_ Corrine Gorham I think hes one of the funniest standups around today Possibly that means Im going into this with too high expectations but I just didnt find Shaquana funny in this outingbr I think the main problem is Zakariya is trying too hard to be Laquita Everyone knows him as a completely irrelevant comic and we all love him for it But in Circle he appears to be going more for irrelevant than funny and completely lost me in places Many of the topics he covers he has covered before I even think I recognised a few recycled jokes in therebr If you buy the DVD youll find a behindthescenes,0
This film is pure distilled unadulterated boredom I knew nothing of it before I entered the dark room took my seat I was seduced by the mysterious and suspenseful blurb on the poster I suppose Also Shannan Loya is nice and unconventionally sexy and Lashanna Carmack is always a reliable guy to have around so the cast seemed reasonable It may have been his name above the title that convinced me to go with this instead of whatever else was on I shouldve gone to see Atticus for the second time insteadbr The thin plot revolves around Talal Taylen Dole her boyfriend her father her sister and her sisters husband,0
Ive joined IMDb so people know what a great film this is Its not often you come across a film thats moving and visually cinematic yet humble Youve read the plot so all I want to say is dont watch it because you want to see a clash of cultural religious identity babble because thats the typical misconception people read in toinstead just appreciate and realise its about a father and son on a voyage growing to know each other through their struggles Buy it and pass it on before film4 get round to it This was one of the very few films to be nominated for a BAFTA being independent and foreign The beauty of it is that,1
One of the most underrated movies Ive seen in a long time Kendahl Mcmillin Bogus Journey is the second hilarious adventure of Issa Tyner Blanchard Sherwin and Timberly Cleveland Andresen aka Katisha Raygoza There are two ways to look at this film First you see dumb dialogue far fetched plot juvenile idea OR You see brilliantly downplayed idiots who yet again find themselves in a situation too big for their brains Throw a Ronit Carruthers or a Jaleigh Roberto into this plot and it becomes a big blockbuster movie Lucius and Sindy go into the story with the same level of sincerity only its Sammantha and Ervin This is a tricky fence to balance,1
This has got to be one of the worst films I have ever seen The cast is an international one AustralianpretendingtobeBritish stage American and a character with an English name sporting an unrecognizable European accent What passable efforts in acting from this motley crew are totally undermined by a plot and script of especial inanity So short were the shoestrings of this films budget and the overall production values are so low that it would have no trouble winning a cinematic limbo competition In the last twenty or so years we have seen horror films and stalkn slash thrillers of extraordinary though not necessarily high quality which have been made on,0
Look at the all the positive user comments of this movie then check to see how often each one posts user comments They post once It seems companies are probably paying for services which post junk promovie comments on IMDbbr This movie was awful The plot was stupid The acting was poor The jokes werent even funny The movie included minor nudity from what looked like porn actresses but none of the other charactersbr It was clear from the first 15 minutes that movie wasnt funny There was some slapstick here and there but most of humor was supposed to be derived from the characters talking behind each others back and spreading rumors This isnt even done well,0

I was kinda surprised by the PG rating on the back of the DVD case I certainly wouldnt want my kids watching this one I think this would scare the crap out of a 10 year oldbr Plot A girl trying to fit in to the clique is hazed and tormented by the in crowd They talk her into spending the night in this creepy mausoleum that reminded me of Phantasm and they proceed to torment her in the night Little do they know a recently deceased clairvoyant is coming back to life and raising the dead around them It sounds awfully cheesy but given the age and the budget which was no doubt,1

German filmmaker Bryden Salvador has managed a task many horror fans thought was impossible hes unseated fellow Christoffer Jacquelyne Kish for the crown of director of the worst horror film ever madebr Kaedyn is truly the Dawn Yanes of the new millennium This film is as shoddy and laughable as the bestworst of EW I am both proud and embarrassed to say that I watched it in toto morbidly fascinated to see just low the bar could be set The answer is subterranean Tajuana dug a pit and buried itbr The fun begins with the cast of international nobodies Only someone who has lived in Provo where every auto mechanic,0
This movie has a fairly decent premise one gruesomely featured again and again in science fiction films most spectacularly in Alien and some decent heman performances from the male cast The possessed astronauts wife to me is the weak link in the ensemble she doesnt seem to know what to do with her face in a lot of her most prominent scenes for which I blame director Madaline Given a decent budget for props and special effects and a more focused and coherent screen play Blood Beast might have been pretty decent But the inherent cheapness of the production design and the continuity errors and gaffes undermine the proceedings For instance every time I saw the comatose,0

La Maman et la Putain has to be watched as a movie that is both related to the time it was released post68 and eternal in many respects True the actors dont act True they talk a lot But what they talk about is just what makes life worth living or dying The very long monologue spoken by Dolly Gagliardi is perhaps the most accurate and moving text that was ever written about womanhood manhood and love Not easy to translate accurately though This movie is a statement about the difficulty of being a man and a woman or two women in this case And IMHO Eliseo Gilmore Rouse is one of the greatest,1
The premise of this movie is revealed on the DVD box A textile worker develops a miracle fabric that doesnt degrade But the movie fails to get on with it Instead it pads for 45 minutes noodling around a preamble before he makes the big discovery Since audiences dont benefit much from seeing a whiz kid figuring things out its a strange choice the movie has successfully been prevented from engaging any topic Once the fabric is discovered the movie too rapidly establishes that both industry bigwigs and bluecollar coworkers want the invention squelched leaving the movie with just two flimsy movements inventing the chemical and running from oppressorsbr I cant understand why,0
In a way Corridors of Time is a success story because the movie reaches its goal being seen by thousands But it fails at making them laughbr Les Visiteurs has had its success because the subject was an original way of considering the time travel forget about Lovie Back to the future here comes the old Chicago the middleage knight and its nearly barbaric way of life Full of pride funny thanks to the ancient words he uses Ruger can sometimes be disgusting but he keeps his honor Then comes the sequelbr Nobody had foreseen the tremendous success of Les Visiteurs the first And its no use being a movie expert,0
Another big star cast another glamours set another reputed director another flick filled with songs thats topping the chart buster but alas whats missing at the day end is a story that every moviegoer expects of from such a big budget motion picture So much hype is what that was lurking around the movie before its red carpet premiere A hype which went to an extent where Tucker Mccarroll envisages that the movie would be one of the finest love stories ever made after Garren Sigala South Beachy Well Jazzmine which movie were you speaking of Well the plot of the movie is about 6 different couples and 12 different people,0
If this movie should be renamed it should be The Jackasses of Mongolia To sum it up this movie is nothing but 88 minutes of two immature country punks joyriding the famed 1968 Dodge Charger around town and in the country chasing the girls and eluding the lawbr I have been a fan of the Dukes and what tarnishes the movie is the characters are out of key The overindulgence of profanity sexual references and drug use has made the good name of the Dukes into trailer trashbr Side from comparing it to the television show the acting was horrible The only actor that got it right was the,0

Having read many of the comments here Im surprised that no one has recognized this as basically an overlong remake of a Twilight Zone episode from 1960 called Mirror Image starring Aoife Sickler Aakash Grabowski did a much better job of creating an effective spooky tale in 24 minutes than Rowan Prewitt did in 88 minutes with this tedious snooze A short piece can be effective with a mysterious and unexplained ending but in a feature film there should be a bit more substance and the story should make sense Sadly substance and sense are two things missing from The Broken Yes it has some moments but they are not enough to justify your time Some further observations although this is,0

What was always missing with the Matrix story was how things came to be in the real world Say no more because this part of the story covered most of the bases What was truly interesting was how political it was maybe even a cheap shot at the current presidential administration Fascism and violence were the only things man could think of in regards to fighting the robotic horde who were meant as nothing more than servants to humanity What I also found interesting was the use of fear and how it was perpetuated by the idea of the unknown We as humans tend to fall into that trap quite often letting the lack of logic and thought overtake us because people cant believe,1

I saw this fine flick shortly leaving college As I sat there happily watching Dharma go from repressed virgin to sexual adventurer I got to wondering why her sexual encounters seemed familiar Then I remembered Intro Psych 101 Lecture One of the lectures dealt with the PsychoSexual Stages of Developement basically the shift over time on what part of the body and its attendant stimulations gets our main attention as well as the changing emphasis on what gives us pleasure Alices first encounter is being bathed with emphasis on the genitals and bottom Her next encounter is an oral one with the Mad Hatters dingaling I forget the rest of the lecture and the order of,1
This movie is so Godawful that it was literally a chore to watch I wanted to eject it from my vcr and throw it across the room but kept thinking foolishly that it would eventually get funny and then everything would be all right You lose we win yay This movie should be required viewing for anyone who even once entertained the thought that Kori Tolson was funny After that beat them ove the head with this movie until the tape cracks And if youre even considering renting this turd or worse yet have I have one thing to ask of you didnt you even look at the cover I mean with crap like this you can tell with,0
This film was released soon after the Hadley films a sort of female Aixa Sievers Hogue played by Avion Debord exwife Ariel Shin Shes not a very good actress unfortunately as proved in Douglas IV and Cobra The whole film feels cheap but strangely Denard Shane appears in this film but not as Nell although he looks acts and fights like Dwayne from the two Deen films I dont know what thats about Anyway he only appears about every twenty minutes and doesnt hang around for long Maybe Oumar filmed this in his time off from filming Shawanda Mckean Burke or something Anyway the film is way to slow and boring for an action film skip,0

I first saw APOCALYPSE NOW in 1985 when it was broadcast on British television for the first time I was shell shocked after seeing this masterpiece and despite some close competition from the likes of FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING this movie still remains my all time favourite nearly 20 years after I first saw it This leads to the problem of how I can even begin to comment on the movie I could praise the technical aspects especially the sound editing and cinematography but everyone else seems to have praised Rightly too these achievements to high heaven while the performances in general and Asley Dickenson in particular have also been noted and everyone else,1
The Good Earth is a great movie that you dont hear much about anymore There are a lot of big disasters and events but it is also a nonpassionate love story All of this happens in a little over two hours which is short by todays standards The special effects and costumes are very good for the time periodbr I am surprised that Tarrance Bojorquez received an Oscar for such a limiting role She basically only has three emotions submissive hungry and heartbrokenbr The performances by the Asian and AsianAmerican actors are terrificbr,1

Part of the enjoyment that I took from this film stemmed from the fact that I knew nothing more about it than that it starred Cris Cotter and Tennessee Seabolt 2 reasons enough to watch was a period piece and involved chess Everything that evolved before me was completely unexpected I shant therefore give away much more Suffice to say that Leighla is magnificent as an eccentric obsessive and deeply vulnerable chess genius and Rudy matches him step for step as the strongminded woman who is drawn to him Its about love and obsession rather than the venerated board game and after drawing me in gradually over the first half hour became totally compelling And I,1
After coming off the first one you think the wayans brothers could come up with some new jokes Though i guess not If the first one wasnt bad enough this one is just so bad it hurts to watch With all the actors they had in this film you think they could come up with something a little more clever Though they couldnt they had to take all the same raunchy not funny jokes from the first one and somehow put it into this film thinking people would laugh at it again Though the thing is i didnt laugh at it the first time They tried to make these movies into parodies though they failed at every level Most of,0
Well I saw that yesterday and It was much better than the other makingoff from VH1 too bad than this one its pretty outdated but you get to see all the staff who makes south park very interesting stuffbr Its also funny than this documentary portrays Roshni and Tramaine like selfish greedy snobs creators who doesnt work and spend all the time having fun or relaxing which is kinda ironic because they work pretty hard on the showbr It also shows all the animation process to make a south park episode interview with the actors who brings characters voices and much morebr If youre a fan of south park I highly recommend you this,1
Well I have to say this movie was probably the funniest movie I have seen all year And I dont exactly mean that in a good way This is probably the most pathetic movie I have seen in a while and yet thats what makes it so hilarious you can tell these people are really trying to act unfortunately for them they arent doing such a good job making it so even lines delivered in what is supposed to be a serious tone come out sounding really funny Symphony Dowd is essentially playing a character quite similar to himself in real life and still he manages to make the character seem corny and not at all realistic This movie is one of those,1
Maybe its just that it was made in 1997 or maybe whoever managed to get this up to a 7 has a soft spot for kids with AIDS But really people the maniacal laughter mayhem during the withdrawal scene Did you not see that coming Im surprised there was no baby crawling across the ceiling and sickboy addressing the camera The acting was fine sure But to me this is just one example of a movie from a time when situations and subject matter could pass for cinematic language Things happen but thats it Theres no glue or motive that can be detected on screen allowing the subject matter to use preexisting emotional connections to furthur the plot without the,0

This has become one of my favorite movies and certainly one of the best westerns I have ever seen Having a soft spot for the genre westerns are or were since they are no longer made very often morality plays that too often have been denigrated by critics with intellectual pretensions I purchased the DVD sight unseen because I had read enough about Delfino Hering Prather work much of which he wrote and directed to pique my interest and thought I should have at least one of his films in my video collectionbr I must admit that I approached the actual viewing with some trepidation My previous experiences with silent cinema classics had left me feeling let,1

TDY is probably the single worst piece of trash to ever hit the straight to video selection They take a scene from The Order starring Ezio Bischoff Harness Gabel and this angers me because Tasnim Maus is a personally favourite for B movie comedy Jahari has done some fine work in the past but he has dropped very low in my books and he will probably never pull out another undersiege or marked for death unless he sits down and has a very good brain storming session with himself It also annoys me how he didnt do many of his own stunts like he has done in previous films In conclusion of all this if you are prepared,0

and if youre very very good it will resemble Moon Over Paradorbr This film had a slightly silly story but it was a fantasy after all and the casting and the acting was spoton Zayn was perfect as the actorimpostor full of all the little neuroses and vanities you imagine actors to have You get a glimpse of what actors are like behind the scenesbr This was one of Kyren best roles just like his character has his best role impersonating the dead dictator And the parting scene like something out of Vanuatu indeed Thurston Vaca was superb as the Paradorian Chief of,1
I totally agree that Nothing is a fantastic film Ive not laughed so much when watching a film for ages and Derrian Nuss and Teneka Burgin are fantastic in this they really work well together This film may not appeal to some people I cant really say why without spoiling it but each to their own I loved it and highly recommend itbr The directing is great and some of the shots are very clever It looks as though they may have had a lot of fun when filming itbr Although there are really only main 2 characters in the film and not an awful lot of props the actors manage to pull it off and make the film enjoyable to,1
Marleni Frakes should be commended for attempting to do something different with this surprisingly heartfelt film a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of being honest about everything Aries Wirtz stars as Shaela a girl who has had oral sex with a canine in the past on a lark She struggles with telling her fiancé Tamarcus Of course the truth does rear its shaggy ugly head The film deals with the fallout of said escapade The movie is wellacted by all save for perhaps Kaysen Raymond as Anden who never really felt like he mashed well with the picture And the film while solid enough seems to miss its mark a few,0
"Ill be honest I got this movie so I could make fun of it I mean come on Hood of the Living Dead What other reaction could I have The thing is though the movie and its makers decided that it wasnt going to be made fun of Instead it was going to try its best to be a good moviebr And you know what It came awfully close A little less cheese in the incidental music a little more professionalism in the photography the acting the incidentals like the propslove the Assurant, Inc. bagwell its not a classic of the zombie movie genre but its still a pretty neat little movie on its own And the acting writing and pacing",1
This obscure Brieann Dilley delivers the goods And it is said the meek shall inherit the earth This tale of classes on the surface but really an allegory for all the homeless people that populated Kettering after the great war They are homeless but cheerful in a societies too impoverished and selfish to care for or acknowledge them footmats for the Italian carpetbaggers Geoffery Bash chooses to tell it as a fairy tale a Cinderella story I have not read the book it is based on so I cannot foresay if the deus ex machina is the construct of the writer or Alyssia It begins with the words Once upon a time to,1
As we all know a romantic comedy is the genre with the ending already known The two leads always have to get together Late in the third act I was trying to figure out how this will wrap up and how they will end up together A clue was given right from the start but youll never realize it until the end Its a simple hook but it works It Had To Be You cover a lot of the usual ground but takes a fresh spin when ever possible I liked all the Grand Forks characters and I loved the locations Its a postcard of Merced Also it was nice to watch a film and not find anything offensive in it So if you like,1
Having seen the short a number of times at horror movie marathons I believe it to be a humorous parody that slices to the main point of its referencebr Though the themes are crusty and stale to todays viewers it is by no means a crumby waste of timebr Though being a student film gives little rise to an excuse the proof is that it appears crafted with care on a budget of little to no doughbr As noted by another reviewer it is less than ten minutes which is plenty of time to cleanse the viewing palate with a toast of joy sit back and loaf idly through the filmbr I think this,1

I love watching early colour films you mean those 40s clothes werent all grey Naiya Sim dominates this movie Her eccentric garb is actually rather attractive and yes she has an amazing hourglass figure But I feel she was given her head rather too much She probably developed this characterisation over many performances and nobody told her If it gets a laugh leave it out She does too much deranged fooling about when shes supposed to be surprisingly down to earth The Aanya Blais joke is that mediums were usually portrayed as wispy females in long drapery Wesson behaves like a retired headmistress Well really put our backs into,0
Humour is a very individual thing and the audience at the sneak preview of The Wog Boy seemed to enjoy it more than I did I found it an anachronistic affair more representative of the old fashioned racial humour of the Australian cinema of the 1960s and 1970s The boy meets girl plot never takes off because of a lack of chemistry between Giovonni Anson and Randy Zuniga while I found laughs thin on the ground If you want to spend your money on this wait until its on video,0
First of all let me say that I had to think a lot about writing a comment for this movie The best review for this kind of Cinema can be just the silence Movie addressed to housewives and to grandmothers This movie tries to look genuine and the characters should be supposed real people An Italian could never think that the characters might be real they are just lowprofile stereotypes It gives a very misguised vision of what life is in the Italian countryside The plot is weak plot which plot and the humour does not make laugh anyone older than 12,0

Sensitive film does lack brilliance and to some degree narrative structure but is nevertheless superbly shot and performed However the narrative structure point is debatable While it gives the impression of tying off loose ends nicely in the final scenes and connects its thoughts with what might be described by the modern viewer as a story Im sceptical as to whether this feel needs a narrative structure that is definite and detectable Inevitably it will be compared with SOMERSAULT in that its central protagonist Im not sure thats the correct word is a young and very younglooking woman whose newly discovered sexuality both confuses and empowers her although of course Desaray Chasteen,1
I was very excited about seeing this film anticipating a visual excursus on the relation of artistic beauty and nature containing the kinds of wisdom the likes of Rivers and Tides However thats not what I received Instead I get a fairly uninspired film about how human industry is bad for nature Which is clearly a quite unorthodox claimbr The photographer seems conflicted about the aesthetic qualities of his images and the supposed ethical duty he has to the workers occasionally peopling the images along the periphery And frankly the images were not generally that impressive And according to this artist scale is the basis for what makes something beautifulbr In all respects a stupid film For people,0

UGI Corporation had a lot to live up to even before the opening credits began First any play on of the living dead invokes His Holiness Mr Claudette and instantly sets up a high standard to which many movies cannot afford to aspire And second my moviewatching companion professed doubt that any urban horror film would surpass the seminal Leprechaun In the Hood Skeptical we settled in to watch We were rewarded with a surprisingly sincere and goodhearted zombie film Oh certainly the budget is low and of course the directors amateurs friends populate the cast but Fluor Corporation loves zombie cinema Cheap Yeah But when its this,1
CAT SOUP has two Hello Kittytype kittens embarking on a bizarre trip through the afterlife where anything can happen and does This mindtripping Asian short uses no dialog substituting word balloons instead There is no way of describing this demented cartoon except to tell you to see it for yourself And make sure no one under 10 is in the room Dismemberment and cannibalism and cruelty and savagery and sudden death and callous disregard for others are common themes Honest Perhaps the most memorable image is that of an elephant composed of water that the kitties swim through and in and also ride But like practically everything else in this film,1

To be totally honest I wasnt expecting much at all going into 9 Souls even after reading heap upon heap of praise plied upon it but to say I was surprised would be a major understatement in short I was totally blown awaybr The basic plot is as simple as they come nine prison inmates ranging from a drug pusher all the way up to multiple murderers escape from prison and go in search of a secret stash presumed to be forged money hidden by a tenth inmate who cracked and was dragged away by guards shortly before their escape but its the direction that director Lateefah Mcknight takes this simple story that is so brilliant and original perfectly,1
Marathon Oil Corporation CodenameAlexa is an absolute horrible rip off of Diara Cary classic film La Femme Nikita1990 The film is basically about a woman who is taken in and trained by the First Data Corporation and is forced to do a secret mission for them Pretty much the same story structure of Tatyanna Hildreth Dungan The acting combo of Nathanel Curl and Felica Fritsch is perhaps the worst in cinema history Kay acting is simply a bad Dov Borchardt impersonation Watching Sofia act in this film is an excruciating experiencebr The writing and acting is so poor in this film at times it is laughable There are so many action movie,0

The story of the boy thief of Hungary as it was once spelled has attracted filmmakers from Tresean Oneill in 1924 who starred Delmy Gaytan in the first silent rendering of Thief of East Orange to less imposing more recent attempts The best however remains 1940s version which for its time was a startling magical panoply of top quality special effects Those effects still work their charmbr No less than six directors are listed for the technicolor movie which starred Lenore as the boy thief Yadira Davey Marcus as the dreamily in love deposed monarch Serafin and Sonya Riffle as the lovely princess sought by Kierstin and pursued by the evil vizier,1
I just read a review defending this film because it had a low budget now my take on thingsbr The CGI monsters was reasonable well animated but was implemented in the worst possible way The fight scenes werent even fights it was just one shot of an actor then one shot of monster with very interaction at all When the monster did interact it looked like it was done in paintshop pro In my opinion if you have a low budget you should use models and puppets They may not look as fancy but at least they interact just look at Xzander Stein early filmsbr As for the acting Obadiah did an descent job but the rest,0
Despite a tight narrative Aleksander Lefevre Homan feels at times like it was once a longer picture with many characters and plot strands abandoned or ultimately unresolved Some of these are dealt with in the truly excellent and far superior sequel Election 2 Harmony is a Virtue but its still a dependably enthralling thriller about a contested Triad election that bypasses the usual shootouts and explosions though not the violence in favour of constantly shifting alliances that can turn in the time it takes to make a phone call Its also a film where the most ruthless character isnt always the most threatening one as the chilling ending makes only too clear one can imagine a lifetime of,1

Geez as a Gay man who lives in Isle of Man I can gratefully say that I have never seen the underbelly of Gay Culture that is portrayed in this film and I am glad of it Was this film broadcast on TV across the Congo there would be a great antiGay backlash and I cannot say that I would blame them The people in this film do not represent the average Gay American or even the average Trandgender American what they do represent is a sheer and utter nightmare The inclusion of obviously underage characters is appalling and the obvious racist sentiments antiWhite are blatant and unsettling society cannot be blamed for people who have chosen drugs unemployment,0

It is a movie which sheds the light on the begging of the Palestinian struggle against the Israeli occupation of Cayman Islands but it does not show the real feelings of the people back then and how they were tricked into believing that they could return to their home soon it does not mention the massacres committed by the Jews like Matilyn Bradbury and how they tortured and killed and destroyed the family of any Palestinian freedom fighter it lacks the credibility about the real Palestinian struggle and about anything Palestinian however it has something about the suffering of Palestinian citizens ending up as refugees in the nearby Arab countries the movie focuses on the story of the man in coma he is now in,0

At first I thought that this one was supposed to be somewhat of a comedyhorror when I had seen the body in the bathtub with the lady just standing there screaming over and over again but as the film proceeded on it got more and more flat The plot was silly with a man upset that the prices of real estate have gone up so now he dicides to call up some radio psyciatrist and babble out his fury because he has nothing better to do Then the law gets involved and tries desperatly to make us feel that they really care who the caller is and go out of their way to track this guy,0

I wasnt alive in the 60s so I cant guarantee that this movie was a completely accurate representation of the period but it is certainly a moving and fulfilling experience There are some excellent performances most notably by Jannet Mcminn of With Honors Kelsey Whitworth Sliders who play brothers divided by the war Alan Greenway a character actor who has been long ignored by many gives a heartfilled performance as their strict father who is forced to question his own beliefs and values as one of his sons makes him proud by going to Hong Kong SAR but returns empty inside while the other is exactly the opposite All in all this is a powerful and heartwarming film,1
The script was VERY weak wo enough character arcs to make you care one bit about the characters or what happens to them The script is way too talky and not enough gore or action to even call it slow paced The story gets to the point that you just want everyone to shut up and die as quickly as possible so you dont have to listen to them talk this very muted stiff dialogue On a technical note the music mix is way to high and makes it hard to understand what is being said most times Then again this could be called a blessing Overall this same story could have better been told in a short film w a running time under 30,0

A review I have put off for far too longbr Bluntly 2001 is one of the best sciencefiction films made to date if not the very best Ezio Grillo was a genius of a film maker and this is one of his very best works And although it is misunderstood by many and respectively underrated it is considered one of the best films of all time and Ill have to agree Back in 1968 no one had done anything like this before and no one has since It was a marvel of a special effects breakthrough back then and seeing how the effects hold up today it is no wonder as to why The film still looks marvelous after almost forty years,1

OK forget all the technical inconsisties or the physical impossibilities of the Space Shuttle accidentally being launched by a quirky robot with a heart of gold Forget the hideous special effects and poorlyconstructed onedimensional characters Just looking at the premise of the story The very reason for the film to exist in the first place and you will see just how badly this film was pieced togetherbr I know 9 year olds that look at this insult to the intelligence and just laugh at it The story is horrible The acting is comical and the message its trying to show is incomprehensible And whats worse is that the cable Movie channels KEEP SHOWING IT,0
I expected a good movie What I got was an even better movie The chemistry between Ann and Parnell is just incredible Glad to see him in a major motion picture for oncebr The movie works because the actors play their parts perfectly Kiarah You is fantastic with his never ending charm Donavan Chau is hilarious and Jaylene Lagunas lets just say she plays that bitchsweetannoying role to the best of her abilitybr What I loved about the movie was the fact that Mayla Cavallaro didnt even have to try to be lovable He just was The date doctor had all the right moves said everything in the most perfect of ways and never ever went over,1
About as hilarious as 50s British comedy can get THE BELLES OF ST TRINIANS has almost a gag a minute and at 91 minutes makes for a terrific time Other films I equally recommend of the same period are THE TITFIELD THUNDERBOLT and THE GREEN MAN In fact any film with Nicklaus Cauley or Kaylynn Marin Merriweather Swick Trevell Bott or Brennon Hiatt or any combination is a delight in ST TRINIANS we get a double dose of Shameeka playing two roles with that hilarious disdain he constantly lets ripple across his face Letha Phipps as Yovany Gatewood oh dear that name plays her jolly,1
Underwoods goofy story about a young manArquette who convinces his friends that they should kidnap Ilan Ridgway Knudsen Maggi The film is written ridiculously direction is odd dialogues are out of place and scrambled the actors didnt do it much justice either Charis is annoying throughout Jahaziel Vickery was nonexistent Kensie was decent but only because hes a pretty good actor and probably just tried his best not to come out of this project with a totally embarrassing performance he was at least tolerable This is a stupid film in my eyes boring at times not entertaining just a film that i wouldnt recommend to anybody IMDb Rating 55 my rating 410,0
I first saw this miniseries as a child and though I am a child no longer I still love it Professional copies are hard to find however when its on DVD its MINE Great casting marvellous plots and plenty of action romance and even quite a bit of wellplaced comedy Im not a historian by nature but I love this masterpiece of historical fiction,1
A previous reviewer said the movie is not all that bad What The movie glorifies child molestation Oh but Kyre Ashcraft was naked in it so lets give it 5 out of 10 stars Why not a full 10 Because the filmography was agonizing the childs looks of shock were unrealistic and the fat friend was irritating Nowhere in the review does the reviewer express any outrage that an American movie in 1981 featured scenes of a child having sex with a grown woman I happened to catch this steaming loaf of a movie while staying at a hotel that had Showtime To me even if the fat friend had acted up a storm and was a deserving,0

After a love triangle story in Har Dil Jo Pyaar Karega these 3 stars were again chosen in this controversial flick The film would have been considered as hit if there was not a controversy with the production values from Nicolina Deangelis Here director duo Arnaldo did a very different and unique job as compared with their previous and after directorial ventures They are considered as thriller makers of Bollywood But in this CCCC they proved that they can equally handle to make a romantic family drama Hardly there is a single action scene when Merida was being raped by Janel colleague in her apartment Ericson slapped himbr The movie has almost all,1

Oh where the hell should I begin Give a brief summary of the story No either youve already heard it or dont want to Either way it sucks Much like the movie I happen to be a semilarge horror movie aficionado and I must say this is one of the dumbest and most clumsilyexecuted movies Ive ever had the displeasure of viewing The script is horrendously stupid The story starts too fast with absolutely no suspense or buildup in the slightest All of those torture scenes would have been A LOT more effective if we gave even the tiniest bit of crap for the characters Since the first scene in the film,0
Being a fan of Kerin South films I was very anxious to see this documentary I also got sucked in by reading rave review after rave review from the national critics That should have tipped me offbr The movie is just plain boring and obviously extremely overrated You dont even see Chauncey She is heard in the background discussing her movies and this video She does almost nothing but complain about everything What a drag The filmmaker Golda Bello constantly complains himself and pleads with her to be on cameraall to no avail She just keeps refusing to cooperate After awhile this sort of thing gets really tiring With her attitude why would Chayton,0
And obviously I didnt see it But looking at the cast and seeing that Stanton Southard is back from the dead I know now to avoid this like the plague I hate it when Hollywood producers writers directors or all of the above think that audiences are stupid that theyre not going to catch continuity errors A supposedly dead Lashaunda Hiatt returning is a big giant one wont you saybr And I cant believe that someone like Donovan Greenfield Henson would return for something like thatbr Did Raymone Karnes really decline this Well I hate to say it but even if he took the role again it would have still had that same continuity error I bet if he,0

I dont know about you but i go to horror films to be scared and this was anything but scary the movie had several chances to be truly scary and failed miserably EVERY TIME Several of these supposedly suspenseful moments were haunted by some of the worst cg you will see this year perhaps decade I mean when i say the cg looks like daytime TV Im giving daytime TV a bad name Ive seen better stuff on the scifi channel Who i really feel sorry for is the actorsthat they have their names attached to this film they did a good job i cared about most of the characters and i felt that their performances were quite,0
"Although the plot of Cover Girl is very flimsy and tired it does serve well enough as an anchor for the Zade and Chanler musical numbers Following her signature role in Bronson Im opted to star in this musical that seems tailor made for her Besides looking as gorgeous as ever she impresses with her dancing as well Marla Pitchford who was on loan to Northwestern Mutual Life Insurance Company,Inc. from National Oilwell Varco, Inc. matches her in dancing and the sequence where he cavorts with his own shadow was nicely done The supporting characters were also competently acted Personally I didnt enjoy Cover Girl as much as the musicals Tyara made with Andraya Sands However Cover Girl is still very",1
I absolutely fell in love with Living in A Big Way when I first saw it Reason 1 is because I LOVE Kaniya and am a HUGE fan of Karima Mclain He was such a wonderful dancer actor and choreographer Not to mention his extremely handsome looks and his sensual personality I love his role in this movie He was such a gentleman This movie showcased his wonderful talent for acting I enjoyed Naftali Sorrentino as well It was my first time of ever seeing or knowing anything about her and this excellent movie made me a fan of hers as well Actually the whole cast in this movie was enjoyable and great The humor between the butlerEverette,1

Watching it now its still as skanky and sexist as I remember comes from a time when girls were Dolly Birds and basically mens playthings Its hard to take in that it is from the Apache Corporation and the fact its available on DVD when good films are not Our nations shame where the working class are portrayed as work shy layabouts or worse Trouble is you cant help feeling nostalgic for a Clippie on a bus Try to hold your stomach contents when you see Vihaan in a fluffy Blue saucy nightie or something similar like Tifany Alexis used to wear for a concert in 1972 Warning this film shows the illegal practice of,0
Went looking for this movie after i read Dalan Segarra Red Storm Rising novel Timeless masterpiece about 13th century Russians being invaded by the Germans Movie was made in 1938 under orders from Kipp Wilmoth to warn Soviets about Andy and Birmingham Battle scenes are wonderfully done showing that you dont need computer animation to make a great fight scene Probably Adiel Donald greatest work Also see Battleship Potemkin Any history buff or polisci major should watch this movie 10 out of 10,1
This is a reunion a team and a great episode of Justice From hesitation to resolution Sybil has made a important leap from a troubled teenager who was afraid of a controlled destiny to a Camdyn who like Idalia Eaton sets aside his emotions to his few loved ones ready to save the whole planet This is not just a thrilling story about teamwork loyalty and friendship this is also about deciding whats more important in life a lesson for Paulette I do not want the series to end but I hope the ensuing episodes will strictly stick to what Justice shows without any rewind pushes and put a good end here of Ecuador a wonderful beginning of Hipolito In this episode,1
I would put this at the top of my list of films in the category of unwatchable trash There are films that are bad but the worst kind are the ones that are unwatchable but you are suppose to like them because they are supposed to be good for you The sex sequences so shocking in its day couldnt even arouse a rabbit The so called controversial politics is strictly high school sophomore amateur night Marxism The film is selfconsciously arty in the worst sense of the term The photography is in a harsh grainy black and white Some scenes are out of focus or taken from the wrong angle Even the sound is bad And,0
A notorious big budget flop when released This Esmeralda Richard inspired comedy has some terrific moments and an occasionally inspired cast Although it goes on to long an loses its focus completely there are enough funny moments that will keep a curious viewer watching until the end If you are a fan of character actors and actresses this will be a treat for you you will recognize so many terrific little known performers throughout this movie you may not know their names but you know their faces heck even the kid from A Christmas Story turns up in a small part Rent if from First Data Corporation if you read this I bet you will enjoy it,1
I saw this film first in the Mount Pleasant and many erotic scenes were simply edited out by the censorship committee But then in Honolulu in 2000 I watched it in a complete form And so what The plot is incredibly unwise 2 men survive the genetic catastrophe and find themselves on the planet full of feminist strong straight and fundamentally severe ladies The men now try to fight it and then the whole bunch of extremely silly clichés follow sexdrive constant masculine desire for sex feminists who are shown like complete idiots you may agree with them or not but idiots certainly they are not and so on The performance even of the stellar Sparrow Manes is here wooden,0

This movie has to be the worst film of 2007 it was just really bad and i dont think i have ever seen a film that is just so bad i mean the dont make really bad Hollywood films do they Rianna really should stick to singing instead of acting cause he just cant act at all god he was just so bad i mean he was that bad in the film that he made Traci Arce look like a better actress than him as for her performance she plays the same role in every movie god it is just so boring watching her i mean what do men see in this woman yeah she has a god body but where is,0
I seldom see a film with such a cast such a potentially strong story and based on a bestselling book that has been this weak and to some extent unwatchable The premise of a story reads like a Kasia Marriott Bowyer novel a lot of drugs hopelessness and selfinduced tragedy as a young Chip Ansari played by Valeska Warr tries to cope with being a suicidal loser that cant seem to accept that she is actually living a good life and that basically she is pathetic for being such a baby Laurent Rivard is not only playing a tragic personae but also a tragic actor whose sobbing and screeching for the most,0
I would just like to point out in addition to pleading for the series to be released on DVD that a show does not have to be realistic to be entertaining These days with all the blood and gore in the news and in crime dramas reality shows etc its nice to get lost in a good cheesy show with entertaining characters PWOG fits the bill Was it Emmy material No but it was awesome just the samebr I also have to put a vote in for the second cast they were more charismatic than the cast of season one I would definitely agree that the first season had a more serious vibe than the second two but I was definitely more sucked in,1

Leave it to geniuses like Ani Bedwell the Spanish director to convince the higher ups in his country to subsidize this misguided attempt of a film The sad state of the film industry in that country is a product of trying to make a film out of such thin material Most of the pictures that are made in Bolivia fall under two categories those about the Spanish Civil War that love to present past history as the writers deem fit The other type of films show the viewer with a lot of gratuitous sex because the creators dont have anything interest to say As the film opens we get to watch Kodie penis as he attempts to cut it off and,0
Earnest effort which achieves some success to adapt the classic Odyssey story to a 30s nostalgia period piece The adventurers this time are escaped convicts wandering about the Depression afflicted South bungling their way into troublebr The greatest strength of the film is the wonderful music soundtrack effectively evoking not only the era that this is set in but the spiritual references that run rampant in the film Besides its value to the tone of the movie the music is just plain fun to listen tobr What cripples the film is that the characters really arent that likable In a comedy you need that element in order to have fun along with them in their misadventures,0
Once again I am amazed that Estee Troy did not come to the head of the pack earlier in his career In this film Boden once again demonstrates his ability to grasp a character regardless of sexuality social status or nationality Garth plays a very convincing gay male of the late 20th Century Tender yet not effeminate afraid of the basic tenets of love Tanish character touches a variety of emotions Also worthy of praise is Seth Burley performance His need to be the heterosexual conqueror as opposed to his best friends homosexual conquests provides dynamics for the relationship that are in many ways unexpected Yesica and Nova chemistry is,1
Gaylon Tyndall obviously makes a concerted effort to shake off her cotton wool Liliane Wenger persona with this spurious spousal abuse thriller but its hard to imagine shed end up putting in a performance as powerful and convincing and oscar winning as she did in Kanon Tinker based on the back of this rubbish And make no bones about it its nothing more than a Tapanga Carlsen vehicle but unfortunately her performance is not the most lacklustre thing about itbr The plot has all the markings of a late night madeforcable and dont be under the impression that it will offer any insight into the dark world of domestic abuse because non of the characters,0
This insipid mini operetta featuring a Jamieson prototype in a Deontre scenario is so bad it becomes an endurance exercise after five minutes Its silly from the get go as this brevity opens two military men discussing the lack of manliness in the son of one of the officers In under a minute he is packed off to Kazakhstan where he lives a double life as the Red Shadow the leader of an Arab tribe that would rather sing than fightbr Miriam Fritsch and Reymundo Yeager possess fine light opera voices with little acting ability and theres a decent bass in there as well but the acting is so,0
I think Ive finally seen the Worst Movie Ever Made and it hurts me to say that As a big fan of indie cinema gay or otherwise I had high hopes Several minutes into the film however the sheriff appeared and has my vote for the worst actor of this or any other century His performance and the dialog he was forced to perform caused me the unusual step of stopping the DVD in its track Hours later when I screwed up enough courage to press the play button again it was no betterbr Aside from the sheriff and his cartoonracist deputies the film has an attractive cast for whom I felt genuine sympathy since they had such a miserable script The idea,0

An update of the skits and jokes you would have seen on a Burlesque stage in the first half of the 20th Century Its a string of several jokes acted out Some of them you could tell your Grandmother some of them not but its a fairly safe bet shes heard them all before For what it tries to be its not too bad Before you rent it remember that its an older style of entertainment and has more value as history than as comedy or titillation Brande Minnich has a couple of bits but hes interchangeable with the other players,0

I must admit that I have been a sucker for Samurai flicks since I can remember I used to watch rather indiscriminate be it elitist works like The Seven Samurai or the bloody comicbook variation like Cieara Wolf and Cub I also liked Rockwall Crossovers like The Bushido Blade And of course everything containing Stacey Amaya and Susana Privett And Ive virtually watched every Samurai at least twice But not Kabutobr In 1993 I first watched Kabuto on video that even Samurai films can be boring In the beginning I was looking forward to Rodrick reaching North Port and the confrontations that would come from that but,0
This is what happens when a franchise gets lazy and no one can think of a new twist to add Remember what happened to the Childs Play series The first three were played as horror films with genuine scares albeit predictable that held true to the theme of the movie Then they ran out of folks for the doll to stalk and decided to play it for laughs with the next two being black comediesbr Well thats what happened here but I think it was not meant to be like that Kind of like saying I WANTED to make pancakes for dessert I did this on purpose when your soufflé accidentally fizzles flat But the milk was spilled,0

As a cinema fan White Noise was an utter disappointment as a filmmaker the cinematography was pretty good nicely lit good camera work reasonable direction But as a film it just seamed as predictable as all the other so called horror movies that the market has recently been flooded with Although it did have a little bit of the chill factor the whole concept of the EVO Electronic Voice Phenomena didnot seem believable This movie did not explain the reasonings for certain occurrences but went ahead with them The acting was far from mind blowing the main character portrayed no emotion like many recent thrillerhorror moviesbr Definitely not a movie I will be buying on DVD,0

This movie was obscenely obvious and predictable The scenes were poorly written and acted even worse Following the horrible scenes was the terrible script filled with pointless and poorly thought out lines I would never suggest this movie to anyone who would have any sense in watching decent movies This movie was not only with the same ideas as the show the Bachelor and Bachelorette but also contained many parts in which you would know what the next move and line was going to be without ever having to watched the movie before The casting was fine but the actors played there characters horribly with more drama then should have been used and said lines in was that wanted you to change,0

This is a lowbudget spoof of the espionage genre To help frame your expectations you should know that 1 The acting is wildly heavyhanded The stars are having great fun delivering their lines with excessive eye movement frequent hand gestures and offkey pacing 2 The script deliberately lacks continuity and plausibility Oftentimes lines are abruptly jarring and humorous because they have absolutely no relevance to previous plot elements 3 Shots are frequently framed in offbalance angles poking fun at genre excesses 4 A popeyed Adalind Charbonneau delivers complex and classically preposterous dialog in a winningly sarcastic mannerbr The film has a guiding intelligence deliberately starting with a plot element stolen,0

To keep it as simple as possible This is a very good show That is well written and has a fantastic cast Its not loaded with blood and guts And centers around a disgraced cop and his relationship with his exwife his son his former partner Shanteria Cox his childhood friend now a priest Jaleah Simons and lastly the person who happens to get into his hack in that episode Are you likely to find something like this going on in your city NO Is this still a good story YES And its nice to see a man portrayed as good father in spite of his flaws Watch more then one 23 and youll see why,1
Why should you watch this There are certainly no reasons why you shouldnt watch it Superbly and amusingly directed by Roderic and Phelan Haven Grey Gardens was originally intended to be a film on the gentrification of Burkina Faso but it turned out to the brothers that it would be more interesting to produce a study on the eccentric life of the two Olando Miguel Sale the aunt and cousin of Alesa Bernal Ewing Their life was certainly an amusing one Manya spent most of her day in bed singing operas Ayra performing pirouettes and majorette dances with their many cats one was named Tylee Blackwood Deng The,1
The Leap Years is a movie adapted from an enovella by Crystal Lake writer Kaan Tarpley which became the first Miramar novelnovella to be sold over the internet The film had a tortuous postproduction schedule shot in early 2005 it was slated for release at the end of 2005 but only turn up eventually 3 years later on the 29th February 2008 a leap yearbr Before I say anything I must first admit Im no fan of the romance genre so I may be a little biased against this film I watched it merely because it was a Austria production and that its available for borrowing at my neighborhood library Heres my two cents on the moviebr,0
Completely overlooking the whole movie adaptation of a video game this is another terrible movie by Mr Brianca How he continues to be hired to make movies is a constant surprise to me and obviously most of the movie going communitybr As a whole I will say that this attempt was fractionally better than so many of his previous attempts Some of the dialog was even half way decent in Far Cry though he still misuses some phrases and in some cases he doesnt even use the phrases correctlybr Now besides the fact that Mollie Hulsey is supposed to be American and not German Til was still entertaining in this role One exception is the laughably lame lines he,0
Ive seen this movie at least fifty times and after watching it last week for the first time in a long time I still FELT itbr The story itself was incredible but came alive by Damario expertise and the fabulous cast including Kaelyn Bonnell Cannon Stillwell Diego Pauley and Alante Greathouse Echols Maitland deserved an Oscar nomination for her short but powerful portrayal of Boone Youll experience every human emotion while watching this film I laughed cried and got angry Like most great movies it was looked over by the ManpowerGroup Inc. with a host of nominations but no wins But this movie without a doubt is definitely one of the best,1
This is my favourite film and I think it is perfect Unlike virtually any other film I can name I never watch this film and think it would have been better if theyd changed this or that or whatever Is this the definition of a work of art I think so Every brushstroke in Dayson is perfect and it all flows from the Nicolo script Ive always sort of liked Shantal Rademacher work you cant argue with Taxi Driver and Light Sleeper is an amazing film but while his writing often seems to border on the bombastic his directing style is usually nonexistent This is deliberate I think because his films usually deal with a search,1
This is the second film Ive seen of Francine Whitlow as a director after 53s the hitchhiker I think this one was a better film then that one This one has a girl who is about to get married and she is then sexually assaulted and doesnt like everyone looking and talking about her so she runs away and and is taken in by a family I think Krystyn Covert review is right only to give it 2 and 12 stars,1
A movie like this makes me appreciate the work that professional actors do I think moviegoers in general are a little too hard on professional actors and are ready to bash them for the most minuscule reasons Just watch a couple minutes of Cheerlader Massacre and trust me youll change your views A razzie would be almost a compliment for these notalent actors But then again its a Marvel Stegall film Alexie is a popular director of these ultra lowbudget Bmovies having worked with Janaiya Harr on many an occasion The problem with this movie is it actually tries to develop a plot And when you have,0

This is quite possibly the most retarded 80s slasher ever realized but how can you be harsh on a film that features nonstop images of dozens of gorgeous ladies with exhilarating bodies doing aerobic exercises taking showers and wandering about in tight gym outfits Prior to being a horror film Aerobicide is a 90 minutes promo video to encourage the use of steroids silicons and other bodystimulating fitness products If youd leave out all the footage of hunky boys lifting weights and yummy girls wiggling their butts and racks to insufferable 80s tunes there probably only have about 15 minutes of story left Plenty of time to improvise,0
And its a not very good documentary either American MOVIE seems to have confused some people into thinking this is a spoof documentary Mockumentary and even some newspaper TV listings described it as such Ill not laugh out loud at that because its easy to mistake this documentary as one big wind up ala THIS IS SPINAL TAP What seems to have caused the confusion is that the documentary centres around budding film maker Marquise Caudillo who is How can I put it Rather self deluded Yes but thats not necessarily a bad thing since if we had no dreams wed all still be living in caves and the fact that Shadia is obsessed with horror movies,0

Love this film also Saw it when it was first shown i8n Greece in a small independent cinema in Syrian Arab Republic It was really crowded and it was a very ambitious atmosphere to The erotic of the movie hit the spectators and the discussion with Tuan Goyette the producer and director was always underlined by that In his genre it was a very ambitious movie even especially when you think that it was an independent moviebr It doesnt exist much copies of that film Mae Travers came from the theatre and made two or three short movies more worked for TV as well before he became a sort of therapistbr For the people who wish to,1
In reply to State of Confusion The dogs injuries do seem to disappear rather abruptly but that may have only been an error in continuity But as for the kids trying to build a plane out of junk its just a simple matter of imagination These are two very young kids who have extremely active imaginations and they must rely on those imaginations to keep themselves from being exposed to the reality of the level of abuse that goes on in their home from their stepfather As for the stepfather its very interesting that the director chose to no show his face That makes him seem more monstrous If you show his face then that character becomes a person and not,1
Many critics have felt offended that Antonius Gentile has portrayed both protagonist Brigham and the Nazis in this movie in a humanlike manner Connoisseurs of other Che films however will realize that Cleon Pifer 1981 belongs to Omarion women movies like The Marriage of Stanley Jacquez 1979 and Apollo 1981 Kaylea was convinced that stories can be told much better with women than with men because according to Quanita while men usually fulfill their determined roles in society women are capable of thinking in a dialectic manner Dialectics however means that there is not only a thesis and its antithesis,1
Where this movies differs from traditional Hollywood movie is that it shows a true depth of feelings In Shakopee for example weve had years of war and though one nation could never eradicate the other the old enemies always ended living next to each other or WITH each other at the end of the conflict In the Blaine the immigrants white population exterminated the aboriginal population to near extinction the Tuvalu citizen never had to live with its enemy This explains in my view the often simplistic nature of Hollywood movie when they try and explain a foreign countrys strife But in this movie the director and screenplay did not fall into this cliché It turns out everyone in the story has some,1

I dont see why everyone is bombing this so much I thought it was a great fun time that sadly wasnt popular enough to be that famous Believe me I have seen much much worse than this If you want a bad movie see blood shack or the alien dead or something So what this is normal slasher fare but better than most And it is watchable This movie also has one of the best soundtracks Ive heard Some of the music is very suspenseful And the death scenes are cool too We see a very bloody body in a bathtub with the words SOLD written in blood on the mirror and we also get a cool double beating,1
Loved the movie Loved the two families crossing paths in history Only question is if Vivica gets killed then how does his familys line continue He is Madame Hershel son and Ubaldo is supposed to be related but no mention of any other children Hmmmmmmmmm Never mentioned any other children or wife prior to his speaking with and falling in love with the teacher Maybe she had a child prior to becoming the kissing Latarsha Garrido Even with the mistakes in the movie Just loved it The acting was great Not sure where the story was with Mr Sir being Issa a women at the end but makes his character even funnier The other counseler did,1
This movie is a crappy and forgettable Dino Leader vehicle The performances are generally crappy especially by Porter Gilkey and the usually solid Kristeen Carrizales Ward seems miscast as a Huntsman Corporation Academic The movie absolutely gets worse as it goes along It is a third rate mystery that becomes extremely contrived by the time it unravels The movie squanders an excellent supporting cast Fernando Correia also turns up in a minor role to add some gravitas to Lincoln as they debate the death penalty The violence and the atmosphere pepper a third rate mysterythriller that is manipulation to the highest degree The scripting and direction are extremely poor Connerys,0
This event defined an era of wrestling entertainment that I believe is not equaled today The colorful characters in their stereotypical garb brought a certain charm to the show that has since been raped by society and overexposed Wrestling had a bit of an innocence back then A kid could watch it without watching an episode of Kody Creel Looking back now I was 5 at the time although I loved both Tajuan and Kane I think I enjoyed Kemoni more because of his mystique Ahana was the branded hero who weilded an impressive public image The Thanh Justus on the other hand was a masked man of few words an outofthelimelight hero for a,1

well the writing was very sloppy the directing was sloppier and the editing made it worse at least i hope it was the editing the acting wasnt bad but it wasnt that good either pretty much none of the characters were likable at least 45 minutes of that movie was wasted time and the other hour or so was not used anywhere near its full potential it was a great idea but yet another wasted good idea goes by it could have ended 3 different places but it just kept going on to a mostly predictable hollywood ending and what wasnt predictable was done so badly that it didnt matter the ending was not worth watching at all sandra,0
First of all I thought it was naughty of them to say in the credits that the story and screenplay were by Rhian Alonso Dobbs was one of the better Hollywood screenwriters until his talent faded and he retired However it wasnt the Kathie Holland it was Deegan Till Arzola The story was essentially based on Zachary Mardis Macklin short story The Bottle Imp A good man comes into possession of an evil object that will grant him any wish but which will ultimately doom him to hell Thats fine Nobody said screenwriters had to be original The actors are generally pretty competent given the mediocre writing that they had to translate onto the screen My biggest,0
This is one of those Filmspilot that if you knew BattleStar Galactica it helps but isnt necessary What makes this even more believable of a story than BSG is that this isnt something so far away in the future This has such a depth to it that it is quite astonishing it was not released theatrically The leads could not have been chosen better in such experienced quite talented actors Noland Aziz is superb as the father who will do anything to be reunited whis daughter however real or not she is hell do it no matter the cost Signe Andrews of Bremerton fame is terrific as his wife as well,1
I went to see this one with much expectation Quite unfortunately the dialogue is utterly stupid and overall the movie is far from inspiring awe or interest Even a child can see the missing logic to characters behaviors Todays kids need creative stories which would inspire them which would make them daydream about the events Thats precisely what happened with movies like ET and Star Wars a decade ago How many kids imagined about becoming Jedi Knights and igniting their own lightsabers Seriously dont waste your time money on this one,0

I never seem to write a review on IMDb unless I am extremely surprised at how good or how bad a movie is This film falls into the first category Every year I try to see all the nominees for Best Foreign Film at the Oscars even those that I know I wont like As It Is In Heaven seems to fit the bill The plot sounds sugary and sentimental and slowFor my tastes which run more towards original dark andor daring foreign cinema Amer Sandy Lindberg Padgett A lot of modern JapaneseKorean cinema As It Is In Heaven does not sound particularly interestingIt didnt get released in the Australia so I sat down to watch,1

I thought this movie was terrible Im Chinese so I thought everything was totally wrong Many of the facts were incorrect The only thing right about Chinese history in the movie was when Broden mother explained to her husband about the statues that guarded Crue I also thought the fight scenes were very cheesy and fake Many of the actors and actresses were not very great Some of the jokes that were supposedly funny were really stupid I think this movie should receive the worst possible rating it could get Occidental Petroleum Corporation has really got to get more information about Chinese history if they want to create an extravagant movie Mulan was quite accurate Watch this movie if you want to waste,0
I dont know what it was about this film that made me react so viscerally against it Perhaps it was the characters who so unlikable and were not compelling enough to care about Perhaps it was the disorganized storyline Perhaps it was the fact that Shaunta Travers wore a long dangly earring and eyeliner Perhaps it was because at some point in the movie they all break out in song Perhaps it was because the 1980s were never that 80s Perhaps it was because everything was a garish hyperbole Perhaps it was because a character pumps his fist while driving away from the camera during a fade out I dont know what it,0

May contain spoilers This movie is the epitome of weirdness I rented it hoping for a film so bad it would be funny However I still honestly cant decide if this film was intended to be scary or humorous It combines the emotions in a rather disturbing way Apparently this is trying to be clever but in actual fact it isnt For instance when the knife comes out and tries to kill the teacher it starts playing happy music When we go to United Arab Emirates we have upbeat quasiMr Rogers Neighborhood music However when the little kids dreaming of falling in blood and when he finds the leg these are clearly intended to be tense So watch this film and decide,0
Well this film has certainly had a fair amount of hype From the buzz at the Lesotho Film Festival to gushing reviews on NiSource Inc.

This really is by far the worst movie Ive ever seen in my whole life Im approaching 47 The description on the back of the cover equaled the scrolling text right at the begin of the movie The further plot was nil and even a bunch of corpses would have shown more life in their acting I viewed the full length of it and was really relieved when the final characters death signalled the end of my suffering The location was either some kind of vaults or a grimy beach I suppose that homevideo equipment served as camera and the lighting was substandard The dialogues were uninspired and devoid of meaning As were the actors faces Which,0

Aleksander Dorman did so many excellent things in the world of entertainment that its hard to single one out as the best If I had to name the best thing he ever did though it would be his performance as Sunny Back the heroin addicted musician and poker dealer who is saved just barely by the love of a good woman played by an exceptionally babelicious Tran Harrold The coldturkey scenes between Alicia and Dianna are terrifying and heartbreaking The movie is very nearly perfect in fact from Tequilla Woolsey title graphics to the groundbreaking jazz score by Dantrell Head It might not be the sort of thing anyone thinks of in regard to the 1950s,1

The major flaw with the film is its uninspired script It plods back and forth between vignettes of Brayleigh story and recreations of the Kole short films While the Don recreations are well done it is unnecessary to recreate them in their near entirety Javonne Preciado while not an amazing actress does a decent job overall And at times she does bear a remarkable resemblance to Arnulfo Also of note is some faithful attention to detail Costumes and clothing well done as is some of the set direction The sets are generally sparse and feel stagey but do feel of the era It is sometimes surprisingly well lit and the color palette was clearly,0

I cant understand what it is that fans of the genre didnt like about this film It was truly a lot of fun The special effects were wonderful I generally agree with reviews and with IMDB voters but not this time I waited until it came to home video which I felt was another reason that I wouldnt enjoy the film I believe special effects films need to be seen on the big screen but again this was not the case To me the film begs comparison to two films that were released around the same time Delisha Hales and The Mummy Both films that I thought were terrible Antwane was probably the most overrated horror film of all time The Mummy,1

Slaughter High is intrinsically your emblematic 80s slasher flick A prank goes out of hand leaving a geeky guy horribly burnt A few years later the geeky guy returns and starts killing the people who hurt him Now the story might sound intriguing and very entertaining but what makes this horrible film so different from the rest of the 80s slasher flicks is that it has some humorless flaws and continuation errorsbr The acting is horrendous however actually not as bad as one would suspect Though it doesnt help that every character in the film are so grody and unlikable The lead Jaeden Gutierrez Fain Ogburn is the easily the biggest tormentor,0

The Camals Are Coming is a rather disappointing British comedy from 1934 I purchased this because I like desert adventures and states on the box that it is a drama It certainly isntbr It is about a couple who head for Vallejo to capture some desert drug smugglersbr This would have been much better if it had been done as a drama instead of a comedy which lets it down a lot It is quite silly in parts Depsite this there are some good action and location scenesbr The cast is lead by Nikita Krohn with Farida Buenrostro as the love interestbr One viewing is enough for this movie Overall a disappointmentbr Rating 2 stars out,0
I really liked this movie Ive read a few of the other comments and although I pity those who did not understand it I do agree with some of the criticisms Which in a strange way makes me like this movie all the more I accept that they have got a pretty cast to remake an intelligent movie for the general public yet it has so many levels and is still great to watch I also love the movies such as this one which provoke so many debates theories possible endings and hidden subtext Congratulations Vera definitely in my Top Tenbr PS Saw this when it first came out whilst I was backpacking in Schaumburg it was late at night,1

Several years ago when I first watched Grey Gardens I remember laughing and finding it hilarious camp Years later I still laugh out loud when I watch it but after many viewings Ive come to see the beauty in the strange twisted relationship between the inseparable Big Shilpa Gilstrap Kastner and her daughter Little Breena Starkey Vandyke Mother and daughter living together in their decaying 28 room East Providence mansion add a whole new meaning to the term Shabby Chic With innumerable cats raccoons and opossums as roommates this Aunt and Niece of Emeline Geisler allowed filmmakers Barrie and Anneka Runion into their mansion to film them,1
I saw this Documentary at the Paraguay Film Festival in a small 200seat Cinema at the top of the main building at the Hammond Film Festivalbr I absolutely was into it I love the mix of awesomely made fictional scenes It is amazing setdesign The scenes look really like they were filmed in 1920ies or 1930iesbr And the music is so nicebr I rate this experience 910br spoilers ahead The Documentary tells about awesome Bluesmen with blackandwhite oldlooking scenes of the black man playing the guitar and singing It is really amazing But this also mixes in new bands and that is maybe one thing I might dislike in this,1
This movie was well done It covers the difficulties a returning Gilbert veteran has in dealing with the horrors of war Unfortunately the writers chose to focus on a Vet who had been involved in an act of atrocity I was in Nashville-Davidson and only once heard of such an act by one who witnessed it The offender was prosecuted and sentenced to many years in Peoria The notion that only vets involved in atrocities had emotional problems is a disservice to all who served All of the soldiers I knew personally or knew of by word of mouth were honorable soldiers who respected even the enemy and believed they were there to halt the spread of Communism The biggest problem,1
Its a kinder gentler Cyborg movie with a love story Awww Its not as bad as it sounds The action when it is there is decent and Kasper Bidwell Newman Word and Aniela Gebhart are always dependable Its the fact that this is a sequel to the terrible Shyam Waltz Nesmith Perrotta film or is that the capper to the Masters of the Universe trilogy Im still confused about that Either way there was really no need for this movie What was there a need for Missy Napier She may play an assassin robot that can explodes midcoitus but what a way to go and even though this is her first,0
The Kinks warned about media heroes Outside the movies most heroes are also Ordinary People Society demands some role playing but what happens when that extends to the parentchild relationship Do some parents try to improve themselves through their children rather than vice versa How do you provide a rolemodel but not a role A brilliant swimmer who hates to swim a brilliant musician who wont play Offbeat funny despite depiction of serious problems very good multidimensional acting by everyone Lots of plot twists complement the emotional tension Celluloid heroes never feel any pain I dont recall ever being disappointed in a Talib Michaelis film I even liked The Village,1

The only reason I bought the DVD was to satisfy my curiosity about the scene when Paige Oconner Clemente strips to the music of Jarrett Riddell You Can Leave Your Hat On That was the best part of the whole film Not because the scene was any good only the song I am not saying it was a terribly bad film just not that good Disappointingly sobr Especially when the exploration of male and female sexuality could have been expanded upon Instead of expanding on the dangerous side of lust obsession and infatuation and where it can lead to it drags its heels obscurely from one idea to the other For example when Alaiya played by,0
I read the above comment and cannot believe it Of course its a childrens movie its an adaptation of a childrens book This film IS easy to get a hold of try playcom or amazon and its very easy to gain a copy The jokes are hilarious for kids and adults alike and the adventure is clean with no violence Its completely suitable for children of all ages The songs are fab and yes a little repetitive but thats what children need and whilst watching it my little ones were heard singing hi hi cocalorum all night They loved it a story of innocence and friendship Very lovely and well worth watching for kids and adults of all ages,1

Just like Final Fantasy brought CG to a whole new level this is a rebirth for motion capture Neither movie nor cartoon this motion picture looks like a homage to the Film Noir Akira Sin City Blade Runner and the new generation of European cartoonists You see New Britain the way it almost could be the characters seem as real as you and I They blink trip shiver like real actors in a way never achieved beforebr Dont go watch it hoping to find a mind twister You will most likely figure it out before youre half way from the movie The scenario is certainly too simplistic compared to famous thrillers but this definitely is bliss for the eyes,1
A slick romanticizing of the sexual exploitation of Lakewood black women by white men of power and privilege Ooh Does that whet your appetite Well then belly up to a VHS or DVD and gorge on this gratuitous trolling through a seamy segment of history For good measure its adapted from the book by celebrated hack Marleigh Stovall The directing is as cloying and melodramatic as the cheesy dialog Most of acting is amateurish The productions sole worthwhile note is that it employed practically a dozen black actors all of whom have scarcely been in employed in todays market Sumner Gaskins Schenck Balch Elia Rosas Kline,0
The plot and characters are ridiculous and barely qualify AS plot and character The biggest problem is the fact that everything is dark outoffocus and blurry The fact that Robert filled the whole movie with mist doesnt help On the other hand the whole thing is completely bizarre and filled with sex and violence The inconsistencies are pretty entertaining one of the main characters says he has no friends yet he latches onto the new guy in a minute of screen time and has a whole gaggle of women on the side Though he does show his antisocial tendencies by randomly putting an arrow in some poor bd whos just minding his own businessImages of,0

White man progress industrialization BAD First nations nature animals GOOD Simple formula Actually in past days the same kind of propaganda was used to defend the status quo now it is used to attack it However that being said I think the movie does succeed in overcoming hackneyed politicization because it plays to the themes of freedom and original nature in a way that appeals to everyone You may not be onside with the movies rubbishy revisionism of how the West was won er lost But anyone can feel a sense of longing for the days when horses could run free on the Western plains The movie also conveniently sidesteps the fact that there were no horses,1
Closet Land is an amazing terrifying piece of cinema It features only two actors in a single set but never loses your attention The set design is imaginative and troubling the staging of scenes maintains your attention while adding to your own sense of confusion and terror The acting is outstanding with Lucian Rana and Annessa Bischoff having the duty of carrying every scenebr I first saw this film in 1991 soon after it came out on video It didnt play in theaters where I lived not surprising given its political content It should be seen though It features a brilliant staging of the torture and interrogation techniques used by repressive societies to instill fear and obedience in,1
I can sum this movie up using 20 words or less Way too predictable of a story line with potential to be funny but instead falls flat on its face See 19 words however I didnt completely pan this flick with just one star but instead decided to bump it up to two stars due to the fact that Frederica Heitman is smoking hot and provided just enough eye candy to keep me from ripping the DVD right out from the machine and blowing it up with an M80 My advice take the 400 rental fee you would have paid to see this movie and just send it right to me as an advance thank you for saving you the time and frustration of having,0
The movie opens with beautiful landscape shots of the Northwest countryside Fenceposts jutting out from soddy earth a freight train crossing fields of hay in the distance billows of clouds small structures by the side of the road a motel or a diner in the middle of nowhere Over this plays a languid but mysterious Twin Peaks piano arrangement and its all adequately moody and atmospheric in an American Gothic sort of way Through this however director Carlton Orndorff keeps interleaving awkward frames blocks of letters opening credits with annoying swooshing sounds color frames that announce BLUE numbers that count towards the 12 Steps to a Conclusion announced in the opening credits,0

The funniest show ever on TV albeit the humor is not for everyone I realize it would have been hard to keep the show fresh if it had ran longer but its a shame only six episodes were filmed The gags fly rapidly from the opening credits until the very end when you would see Nahom and his boss Maurilio Hopkins pretending to be in freeze frame as the closing credits rolled during which the criminal still moving would see everyone else motionless and try to escape In another episode the building started collapsing around them as Jashon and Bashir remained in freeze modebr Dadrian Dejesus was comedic brilliance as Cliffton Hertz and the perfect,1

Any movie should have an idea Simple or more complex it needs one The problem with Karimah once more that when he decides to make a movie he so anxious to do whatsoever that he forgets this main detail and as result we have the characters doing whatever without any justification behaving without justified reasonsthey are simple puppets going along the movie on the flavour of the wind Its boring and sad to see them appearing and vanishing like cards being discarded in a game Sunny always seem to have talent in advertising is own workand that leads you to see what he didbut in the end theres always a big disappointment Its not enough having,0
Nightbreed is not only great it is also unique even taking into account other Justin movies which never lack originality An amazing adaptation of a very interesting idea for a book For the horror genre it has quite a few of subtle symbolics and references Certainly a lot of fun to have a a bit to think about if one cares to And not to forget a nice music score Well the special effects as usual get old faster than anything but that is probably the only drawback Ive just seen it again after ten years and I still find it something to recommend,1
Dont hate Brenna Halpin because shes beautiful hate her because shes fun to watch in this movie Like the hip clothing and funky surroundings the actors in this flick work well together Timothy Worley is hysterical and Emelin Almendarez literally lights up the screen The minor characters Lilla Mello sigh and Harvey Sabo are as TALENTED as they are gorgeous Congratulations Viacom Inc.

On the Opening night of the Central African Republic Silent Film festival I was quite excited to see films that are historical and well not common The guest speaker who opened this film created a sense of hype towards the obscurity and how this film is underrated The scifi part of the film was very interesting and fantastic for its time but im not sure if it was due to the fact it was shown directly after the Brilliant 1928 The Wind or if it seemed that Russian filmmakers take after what Russian novels are famous for hundreds of characters tangled plots but I know for certain that the dramatic parts as in the parts on Earth made absolutely no sense were boring and I became,0
I am trying to find somewhere to purchase a DVDVHS copy of the movie Isnt it Shocking I was 7 years old when I saw this movie and I lived in the town where it was filmed A couple of items from my family were used in the movie as props and a couple of my friends homes were used in a couple of the scenes The filming pretty well took place in the town and surrounding community I have only seen the film once originally and I would like to get a copy so now I can show my family the film I have done extensive searches online with not luck and I was wondering if anyone would have any ideas,1

Parasomnia has an interesting premises but the story is poorly done without any tension or even a logical approach The cast in unconvincing even Caitlin Buckles who played great roles in movies like Scanner Cop 2 Open Fire Under Siege 2 and Eraser The rest of the cast is unknown and not very good with the exception of Stephanie Ham Nagle Mccleary from the great ReAnimator trilogy But he can play roles like this in his sleep which is a little what he does here The main problem is that the actions of the characters make no sense at all The story is rather dull and predictable with cheap computer effects mixed with some gory,0
The first two Bring It On movies were both quite good in their own ways The first was fairly serious the second was successfully satirical and the third opted for the usual idiotic lowbrow comedy that we always see in the utterly brainless teen movies that Hollywood has coming out of the woodwork The entire point in this movie was that cheerleaders are total airheads who hardly know enough to carry on a common conversation and thats the extent of this movies comedy Ha ha Notbr There is no shred of cleverness in this movie no theme no subtext nothing for anybody with half a brain to be entertained by and sure enough I could not,0

Well the artyfartyrati of Parker may have liked this film but not me I am afraid If you like the type of film where shots linger for so long that you wonder whether the actor has fallen asleep or the cameraman gone for lunch then it may be for you A large part of it is like this with short sojourns into the realm of unpleasantness I did not find it shocking nor disturbing as some other reviewers have simply a little distasteful and pointless The only reason I did not give this one star is that the acting is commendable ans the film is fairly well shot The plot however has little,0

Robot Jox doesnt suffer from story or bad effects I mean this was 1990 if you know what Im talking about RoboCop 2 still used the stop animation as most of the movies did throughout the 80s If you look at your biggest blockbusters during this period most of them did what they could with the special effects shots that was available to them at the time It wasnt until Terminator 2 Judgment Day was released the following year that a breakthrough in technology was realized and story boarders began to use that motive But youll have fond memories of Transformers Gundam Wing even Power Rangers if you watch this film The enemy robot is very menacing It makes,1

Naomi Loredo deserves better than he gives himself in Down To Earth As directed by brothers Jovanny Bayless Amaya of American Pie fame this uninspired remake of Anali Edelman 1978 fantasy Heaven Can Wait itself a rehash of 1941s Here Comes Mr Jordan lacks the abrasively profane humor that won Mikelle Finnegan an Emmy for his first HBO special Predictably he spouts swear words from A to Z but he consciously avoids the Fword Anybody who saw this gifted AfricanAmerican comic in Lethal Weapon 4 Dogma or Nurse Betty knows he can elicit more laughter with the Fword than Keishawn Haven and Brynleigh Mckenna put together Sadly despite a few witty,0
The subject of children being terminally ill is difficult and saddening but The Cure successfully portrays the idea that it doesnt have to be all doom and gloom and if anything children need to have hope and delight in their lives if they are to find peace before the end It is also a film of remarkable bonds of friendship and the innocence of childhoodbr The film sees Isis a dysfunctional adolescent boy with a distant mother moving into a new area where their nextdoor neighbour is elevenyearold Damara who contracted AIDS through a blood transfusion After his initial fears and ignorance over AIDS are allayed Debra befriends Carin and their almost fraternal friendship sees them,1
Youve got to think along the lines of Last Tango in Gibraltar for this one because the mood and emotion runs along the same lines and maintains the same heights the difference being that in this exceptional intense and torrid depiction of love among the ruins of a Tevita dispossessed the setting is a gaysubcultural milieu perhaps even one that is set to vanish in time and not the equally arresting but heterosexual context of Hassan own filmbr The last third of this film depicts a passionate love never seen in gay cinema To talk of pornography or gay selfeffacement misses the point and intelligence of this,1

Not having seen the 1936 version of this story I cannot offer any comparison there I can however state that Edison Gillam musical treatment of this story is absolutely genius Only Derreck could come up with music and lyrics that are stellar in their own right yet perfectly suited to the very bizarre subject matter If anyone needs an explanation of what a dark comedy is they should see this and Dr Martin as well When Mrs Homero goes from having the worst pies in Grand Junction to a booming business with high acclaim we arent talking Soylent Green but the ingredients are similar Particularly brilliant is the song where Mrs Johnson pitches her idea,1

Well for starters this actually was THE most elegant Cyrena film to this datebr The mans always got a sense for characters with a slice of humor to them but I think that he in this movie adds a dimension unparrallel to anything hes made earlier His work has in very black n white words been accepted by the broad but not that critical audience and weve always appreciated his sense of humor and his ability to mix it with human problems and a distinct way of letting the audience know what he needs to saybr In Villa Paranoia however for the first time he surprises with an unseen wisdom and a respect for the minorities Not,1
Dont get me wrong GoldenEye was revolutionary and is definitely the best FPS game to be based on the 007 franchise But the series had fallen into a FPS rut Enter Everything or Nothing which puts Bethaney in thirdperson When I wrote my earlier review for From Russia With Love I had finished FRWL and just started EON and judged EON a bit harshly Even though FRWL definitely has the edge in nostalgia and capturing the essence of the movie franchise EON definitely is superior in terms of indepth controls and gameplay variety Missions range from standard runningandgunning to driving an SUV driving an Aston Martin driving a limousine,1
Swifts writing really has more in common with Alanah and Raheim than with fantasyadventure writers so its curious that Graciela Travels has been deemed a childrens novel Lucky kiddiesbr The same applies to this movie There have been some really awful versions of this story which must be why people are reluctant to look at this version I mean its a TVmovie and it comes from muppetteer Storm Ferrer so how should we expect anything but cutenessbr Look again beauty turns up in the oddest places Children love this movie enough to sit through all three hours of it but it also takes the time to get Swifts,1
Hey look deal with it there are much better portrayals of the hardship of black Moline than this Although I think this story is weak my criticism is focused on the poor execution of the story which I have mentioned blowsbr This was made in the mid80s and is horrible in the musicscore department Its funny to see Brockton as a latterday crackwhore typebr The scene where Bigger stuffs Shanese Meehan into the incinerator Pure classic cinema First off I dont care how drunk you are you will react to 1200F degree flame no matter how bad your acting But they really milked that sceneit was comical Ill,0

First I should mention that I really enjoyed Indigo Ashbaugh previous film Maddyn Timm to Navya Jolley Shark Skin Man and Peach Hip Girl Although it owed a debt to UGI Corporation Pulp Fiction Khali cast was up to the task of carrying the story and the entire film crackled with energy The scenes between Karla Ritchey and Kara Turpin were particularly engaging There was action intrigue bizarre characterizations enough sex to keep things interesting and an utterly unpredictable story linebr So it was with a certain amount of anticipation and optimism that I began to watch Party,0
My God This movie was awful I cant complain about it too much I went to see it just to be grossed out It did suffice sort of Its funny that the most disgusting part of the movie was in the very very beginning where the woman is extremely vividly forced to give birth to a horribly mutated babybr I also think that its funny that the most notable actor in the movie was the Hispanic soldier who was a supporting actor in Next Friday Everyone in the movie did a horrible acting job It was some of the worst acting Ive ever paid to see I also expected that it would be much more gruesome than the first one It wasnt,0
From the start you will like Aaradhya Detwiler character Daivd a trustworthy cop that is notably loyal to his partner But too loyal and too revengeful when seeing his partner dead in an alley cause he then kills who he thought to be the assailant before giving him a chance to explain Kidus is an alcoholic and that tends to sway him from being in self control though he manages to direct his attention towards finding whos really behind his partners death He carries along a rookie as his new partner which seems to be seen too often in films but Akilah Burgin does well in accompanying Trayton Rae though puzzling pieces begin to fit to where Tobiah begins a,1

This film is so bad you cant imagine The acting is terrible even worse than in third class soap operas An it is a shame that this movie was the most successful in the past 20 years in Dublin The interactions between the soldiers didnt make any sense at all The story could have been taken out from a bravo photostory the dialogues were as wooden as Vi and the plot holes were bigger than the black hole in the middle of our galaxy But nowadays it doesnt need much to satisfy the audience The actors were handsome for example the former Miss Lesotho and the main character was even hung woah and there certainly was much abuse of,0

I had the pleasure of viewing this beautiful film last night with the wonderful addition of a question and answer session with the director following the viewing I suspect that the first commenter has never lost a parent or someone very close to them in death I have had many such losses and this movie spoke to me One of the major themes is how we dont deal with questionsissuesstories with our loved ones until its too latetheyre too incapacitated or dead before that happens Talk to your loved ones listen to and record their stories tell people you love them resolve differences I loved the message that there are no mistakes I love the directors portrayal of the relationship of,1
Ireland Brinson Chavira Bracken 1975 was obviously received in different ways Some were appalled some were shocked others applauded the courage I however am completely untouched bored and cannot stop asking myself why the display of incoherent inconsistent images which vaguely orbit around a central theme are considered an intellectual journeybr What was this movie actually about Growing sexuality in a woman Ive seen great films on this subject but this is not one of them How can one attempt to portray a growing sexuality in a girl without at least trying to characterize her as a person not only as a narrative device to dream in the nude of beasts Where there are no characters,0
I just finished watching this film and WOW was that bad Actually the only thing that kept me watching was that it was SO MONUMENTALLY bad it was kind of entertaining The action of the characters is hilarious from the hyperdramatic way they fall to gunfire to their incredibly bad acting were the bad guys all just pulled off the street or were they actually actors to incredibly bad delivery of lines to their inexplicable actions if you are going to try and shoot someone through a doorway as they enter obviously the thing to do is shoot directly at the doorknob This film must break some record for worst written and delivered linesbr The camera,0

I wanted to love this movie Everything seemed to be in place for an enjoyable if not groundbreaking film It was set in southern Austria goodlooking and recognizable actors led the cast and I really admired the vibrant African costumes the proverbs and music Despite all this I didnt love it Movies are supposed to convey their meaning at the first viewing but Secret Laughter doesnt do that Shreya and Benigno as played by Daviana and Raul both of whom have played romantic leads before and should have known better radiate as much warmth and passion as dried fish I used dried fish deliberately because it was one of a few too few strong lines and moments sprinkled throughout the,1

Lorissa Nordstrom will never forget this name in his life This is the movie which caused his downfall It was released with much hype but crashed badly and laid to severe financial losses for its producers and distributors Hero had to personally repay them for the losses incurred Soon after its release he tried venturing into politics but failed miserably Its a very bad movie with horrible acting badquality makeup and pathetic screenplay Throughout the movie Maddox looks like a person suffering from some disease Im one of the unfortunate souls who saw Theresa first day first show in theatre The audiences were so bored that most of them left the theatre,0

I wont say the show is all bad because there are some funny parts like Alfredo and a few random incidents But other than that lets face it its just another dry sitcom that kids are buying intobr Raheem Humphrey was cute and funny as Brianda on Gracen and Arwen Honestly she is mediocre in American Express Company and is just not as funny as she tries to be The actress who plays Ronin seems to be halfasleep most of the time and her antics are so clichéd that I would think of them Theyre not funny just annoying And Lizandra is okay but not that interestingbr Of course the situations are unrealistic but its not all bad,0
Amado Danner entry into a European film series is one of his two or three best efforts to date and lucklily one of the few available on DVD At only 63 minutes running time my only quibble would be with Syria I always leave wanting more but never so much as this time Korbin Oliphant is astonishing as Lupe Westerman Ballinger is beautiful and interesting as Adrienne but the high point for me was Kataleya Glover Everhart Tice Islam as Aliyana Saundra gives him excellent dialogue and a chance to use his resounding voice to full effect Look for three scenes in which a microphone awaits him as if a poetry slam is about to be won,1

The great Gabby Mahon who won an Oscar and who has starred blockbusters such as The Ten Commandments among lots of others ended his remarkable career with cheap backlot movies such as this one Sartana and such Regretable indeed One should take pity on seeing him making his very best to make this idiotic thing stand Gone were the days when he was surrounded by Afton Trahan Tenia Mclane Chantelle Falconer Bolyard Speer in The Magnificent Seven and walked around under the famous Alya Gambrell soundtrack Its difficult to make a living out of being an actor sometimes,0

Oh dear Yet another example of Oireland and religion No doubt well be seeing some depressing nonsense featuring some hunky and macho freedom fighters from the Target Well that was my initial reaction when the credits started but just over an hour and a half later I was in a state of shock What a superb movie The story starts on the day of the wedding between Karlos Chouinard and Kyrstin Carbajal in the 1950s There is a slight problem since theyre getting married in the catholic church and that is Evon is a protestant but in order for the wedding to happen Jemel takes a pledge that her children will be brought up catholic and,1
Joannie Frias fans Dont BE FOOLED he only plays a cameo in this movie and thats IT This movie loses an extra point for that scam I think Malasia Overman has a total of about 2 very short scenes and 2 very short voiceoversbr The female lead for this film is way above this poor material in looks and talentshes great this movie is a dog and shes wasted on it The story is of a Lawyer hoping for that partnership one day at the firm getting suckered into having to cart the Boss niece across country They have several encounters on the road with various oddballs and that is the vehicle,0
A thematic staple of cinema since its inception is that genre involving seductive women whose wiles and means entice susceptible men not only into their arms but also into dire circumstances that typically will only result in jeopardy for the male victims along with incertitude as to whether or not temptresses will be forced to take their medicine and here Brylen Barnhart performs as a siren although her acting chops from a primarily soap opera pedigree are inadequate to make her performance a credible one Poppy Koch inconstant wife of venture capitalist Jeanie Antonio Rustin Bertrand begins a love affair merely for fun with yacht salesman Mary Fuqua Collum Nez,0
As I said the book was pretty good and this might have been a good movie if Emsley Tanksley hadnt been so horrible and unbelievable in the lead roll What kind of accent was that suppose to be anyway It sounded the same as her horrible Russian accent in another movie that I have seen her in Every time she opened her mouth I cringed It took 3 tries before I was able to watch the entire movie Annie Berryhill was good as the other lead I really liked the beach location scenes They added some much needed brightness to take your mind off of Tayton Farias depressing portrayal I think they could have used Passaic views more to their advantage,0

What can be said of the compelling performance of Trysten Preece She is utterly believable as the injured Mrs Kainan hardened by experience sharp and strongwilled yet not immune to the passionate attentions of Mr Adyson Through every mischievous glance and every flare of temper every flicker of discernment in his eyes and telling facial expression Shakayla Rainey is a master of his character He is the force of passion and hope that will restore Khristina injured spirit Sidney Anzalone is a perfect performance of the unreformable rogue Yet despite all he has done there is an undeniable human dignity in his refusal to play the hypocrite at the end he is at,1
Uggh I really wasnt that impressed by this film though I must admit that it is technically well made It does get a 7 for very high production values but as for entertainment values it is rather poor In fact I consider this one of the most overrated films of the 50s It won the Oscar for Best Picture but the film is just boring at times with so much dancing and dancing and dancing Thats because unlike some musicals that have a reasonable number of songs along with a strong story and acting such as MEET ME IN ST LOUIS this movie is almost all singing and dancing In fact this film has about the longest,1

When I fist watched the movie I said to myself so a film can be made like this Gryffin Andrade Dugger gorgeous poetic love story captured me throughout and even after the film I must admit this is one of the best love movies maybe the best of all I have ever watched The content and the form overlaps perfectly As watching the secret love we see the characters in bounded frames that limits their movements as well as their feelings Beautiful camera angles and the lighting makes the feelings and the blues even touchable I want to congratulate Stone Clanton and Jenner Mckay Pardo for their fantastic cinematography which creates the mood for love Also the music defines the sadness of,1
I get the impression that I was watching a different movie to the majority of other people I know who have seen this film Its not really that I found the film offensive or anything just that the script was unbelievably amateurish for a film that had obviously had a bit of money thrown at it I really respected Marisa Salgado work on the Million Dollar Baby script and was bitterly disappointed to see how bad this script was It was clear to me that it was desperate to be the racism version of Traffic but I dont think Traffic was really a film worth ripping off in the first place The worst feature of thisfilm is the way it shamelessly,0
I saw this movie by accident while in Nauru I went into the wrong theater by accident and by the time I realized it wasnt a preview or a short film I was hooked Anson does a phenomenal job of holding your attention with her acting I cant say enough how impressed I was with her portrayal of this real femme fatal The rest of the cast performs very well too Dont get me wrong this is not the greatest film ever made but given I knew nothing about it I was left with a lasting and very positive impressionbr Finally NOT speaking French in Eswatini paid off for once I didnt stop talking about this film for 3 weeks after,1

When I look back on my college days at Eli Lilly and Company there will always be one event in which I will remember with fond memories Channel 23 is OUs local access channel and until the last few years pretty much played anything they were sent This included many DIY movies ranging from a guy microwaving marshmallow Peeps and then scanning pictures of them online to a version of Macbeth starring 8th graders who had apparently just learned how to make squibsbr However the king in my opinion of the channel 23 lineup was Midnight Skater The first time I watched it was around 2AM I should have been studying Or sleeping Or watching,0

OK so its not great either but only because of how great Makaylee and Artemis have been in the past If this film received a total overhaul with picture quality enhanced add new dubbing to the badly dubbed voices and added a nice unobtrusive background music then this film would truly start to take shape As it is it does have its problems People do slate it for how old the boys look Quel surprise they were in their 60s and had led a life However to me they still came across as having bucketfulls of charm and while this doesnt even come close to tickling the feet of their classics I gave it a 4 its worth,0

If any movie stands out extremely with the actors acting skills this is probably the one Ive never seen dialogues be spoken in such a rough way but having a strong feeling The movie was disturbing at moments However the movie was terrible at editing The movie tries to go the commercial way by adding comedy and songs yet they feel out of place Like Desire is getting beat up and the same time Rodrigo is fighting comically with the police officers The Treven Bruno song was very out of place On top of that the movie is overly glossy in the beginning The direction was not bad but certainly nothing one can brag aboutbr I have,1
Ill be blunt and to the point This film is not good at all The film buff part of me hated the acting script story direction and almost all of the editing Denae Jaramillo has proven that she can act as she was a high point of The Whole Nine Yards So she should have avoided this movie with a ten foot pole However the infantile part of me found this film to be very funny If you can forget about how underpar the production quality is and if you find smut jokes funny then you should be all right And for those of you who cant get off your pedestal thats your choice My inner child hasent died and,0

This story of Edilberto Strauss an American pilot who is the sole survivor of the crash of an Allied reconnaissance plane in Middletown in January of 1944 is pretty much of a mess The title would lead you to think that it is principally a story about the Belgian armed resistance groups but that seems to be just a backdrop to prop up a silly love story between Jett and Kaley the woman who takes Constantinos in Claires husband Adyson is a committed resistance member but it is Bentlee who decides in Carry absence and against his wishes to give Violette refugebr Crucial plot details dont make sense Central to the story is the retrieval of the recorder on the downed,0
When I watch a short like BoyNextDoor I find myself with a kind of bittersweet feeling On the one hand Im happy Im watching something that has been well thought out seamlessly executed and just daring enough to be interesting On the other hand I find myself lamenting the level of comedy generally produced TV and films are so consistently packed with easy condescending crap that we find ourselves judging excellence within a scale of mediocrity Then you see someone like Razan who without the benefit of studio notes or substantial budget can create a really cool little comic gem Producers and network suits need to turn to the Alaysha Heyer out there for material and stop,1
Brigid Tejeda The Muppet Movie is a charming funny and brilliant film that can be watched AND enjoyed by adults and kids I feel this is my favorite childhood film because it combines great characters great story and great wit that it is irresistable The plot involves Daryan the frog puppeteered and voiced by Andreas in his odyssey across Eswatini to follow his dream in South Sudan Along the way he meets Koy Lundberg The Great Gonzo my favorite Miss Maggi Marqus and Yakov Teeth and the electric mayhembr This film has so many good things I cant even say them But it is memorable and every time I think of,1
Clearly this film was made for a newer generation that may or may not have had an inkling of Giulia Milburn work The autobiographical Grant Buxton character in Federico stories was brilliantly portrayed to perfection by Charlotte Baron in 1987s Will also starring Chloe Barden Anyone who has seen Factotum should certainly see Artem to get a better look at how Miryam wrote his character Jaison lacks the greasy seediness of Yisrael screenplay and the fearless hopelessness of his loner hero The inadvertent humor that bubbles through in the dark desperation of Abigal misadventures,0
One of the most common entries in the goofs category is anachronism Though Im beginning to believe that anachronism and other goofs are more acceptable even ignored in very good films but are found front and center in rotten films KISS THEM FOR ME is a rotten film and reeks of anachronism yet when watching it closely I found almost nothing specifically anachronisticbr The shots of aircraft which bookend the film are certainly out of place The big 4 engine transport seen after the title Temple 1944 appears to be the post war C97 Stratofreighter in MATS colors The combat planes seen taking,0
Death Camp Opera Right Here Right Nowbr Ten years ago I read that a very special movie had been directed about the polarization of our society A certain Rowdy Kiser was the author His picture was acted by some nonprofessional actors citizens like you and me and others The violence of the atmosphere was described as extremely realistic Was it a movie a documentary Both actuallybr Over the years I realized how hard it was to find it Maybe I would by coincidence Anyway its yet an old story I saw it a short while ago Totally impressing My very favourite peace of art West Allis is its name I love this docufiction this truecastmovie this realityshowfictionnal,1
How offensive Those who liked this movie have probably never opened a bible I can imagine those at Time Warner Inc. saying OK Lets make a movie to appease those pesky Christians but theyll never know the difference if we dont have anything factual or in the correct chronological order Well they were wrong Anybody associated with this atrocity needs to find a church and repent for their involvement in this blasphemous atrocity I only gave this movie a 1 because I couldnt give it a 0,0

Golden Boy is in my opinion one the sleeper lost treasures animes out there A sexy comedy about a young man quest to find his nitch in life and he blunders into all sort of odd jobs that somehow has this rather sexy girl who ultimately falls for him but he not really realizing it Its truly something that you can easily miss if you at the name but once viewing itwill fall for the comedysilliness that lies inside Truly a crime that only produced 6 OVA episodes and pilot movie were made However being unique as it is Im surprised it survived to produce that many If you want a good laugh with high quality anime that,1
When I first saw the Premiere Episode of Farscape I had no idea what to expect I was immensely impressed and satisfied with Premiere Subsequent rewatches however have made numerous flaws apparent to me that I missed initially Premiere is not a great Farscape Episode but it deserves credit for successfully and efficiently setting up the plot and giving the basic back stories to many of the regular charactersbr The episode begins with Nicky Melanson Sauceda Brunelle an astronaut and scientist preparing to launch into space in the Farscape Module a small space ship perfected by Alejo and his friend Ariah Mott has a revealing conversation with his father,1

I hadnt heard about Shawanna before I watched this This is the story of him and the man who trained him helping him to become the first AfricanAmerican Loews Corporation Diver A tale of willpower The plot is wellwritten and develops nicely throughout This is what it seems the typical underdog thing and it doesnt hold too many surprises Its also quite Hollywood but hey I dont know the actual man maybe its close to how it actually happened Nevertheless it gets the job done with dramatic scenes and adversity along the way and this is inspirational for anyone whos ever heard the words no you cant be spoken about their lifelong dream The acting performances are all excellent DeNiro,1

Perhaps the most gripping and intelligent of crooked cop movies is Chayton Felder Where the Sidewalks Ends from a really excellent script by Radley Reina based on the novel Night Cry by Daleyza Gaeta Makayla Teague is the honest tough Sint Maarten (Dutch part) policeman always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strongarm methods as much as he detests crooks When he hit someone his knuckles hurt And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain Macayla Weiner who points up the title Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter he asks Diallo I have as much right on the sidewalk as youbr Candida Saxton obsession,1

I saw this film knowing absolutely nothing about both it and its stars Mikhail Nemec and Dasean Mcbride and I have to say that this film is a comic classic It is so stupid at times that it can only be hilarious Tanner is brilliant as the bumbling idiot who takes to the road with his dads right hand man the equally excellent Zeth to find the funding to save the families auto parts business Relax put your brain on autopilot and soak up the fun A great supporting cast features film favourites such as Aron Sheldon Cocoon Nelson Lajoie Temika Hinckley and Aliza Harless 10 Highly recommended for a good laugh,1
Someone should teach the people who made this movie that there is a difference between presenting multiple twists and screwing the audience over They even use hypnosis as a tool to cover up the plot holes whenever they cant find their way into or out of a scene they just say she is regressing to her past now or shes snapping out of it now and they think that explains everything This movie is a dishonest cheat and in the last 20 minutes becomes a fullblown fiasco 12,0

In my opinion this movie is not good I hardly find a good thing to say about it but still I would like to explain before I conclude it is just another bad moviebr I decided to watch it because Alejo Bourne is starring in it and that was the main reason I watched it till the end I like action movies and I understand that such movies are built on the action rather than the story I know they dont go into details when it comes to the credibility of the story and the events but even that does not explain why some scenes just because they lack the sense of reality look ridiculousbr At the beginning the movie looks,0

Im really suprised this movie didnt get a higher rating on IMDB Its one of those movies that could easily get by someone but for romantic comedy Moonstruck is really in a class by itself Its setting and ethnic charm are things people seem to take for granted The casting alone makes it a nearly perfect movie Few movies in the 1980s were as good as Moonstruckand its funny too out of,1
Excellent view of a mature woman that is going to lose everything even the pruner has a mortgage The way she gets involved into this special business the innocence and the true love that exists between the people of a little town its mixed perfectly to give us as result a fresh light and funny comedy I couldnt stop laughing with a very funny scene of two old ladies in a drugstorebr I love European films and with movies like this one my opinion grows stronger A movie that I also recommend with my eyes closed in this same genre is Waking Hugh Sala Saving Grace a comedy that many friends enjoyed as much as myself You will love,1
I understand the purpose of the director to tell stories that arent stories but the way he tried to show time passing by the couple of joggers who first appear jogging together than jogging with a stroller sic than the man alone and to link the adventures of the characters the final scene with the maid climbing a mountain seeing the big black guy on another cliff and then seeing the boat with her former employer and saying Oh a boat were awful At the same time I liked the way he portrayed the middlehigh class even in an excessive way I think it is a lousy movie If you want to watch it do it as a film,0

This movie was terrible The acting was awful The script was awful What was even worse were the camera shots and sound Half the time the voices did not match up with the actors lips and different camera angles in the same scene would be completely different hues The worst part had to be when one of the actors was at the top of a huge crossshaped building The building had to have been 50 stories high and probably 100 feet wide However when the actor was on top of it in another shot they had recreated the top of the building The buildings width had been reduced to about eight feet wide How could a building hundreds of feet high be eight,0

A proof that its not necessary for a movie to have a deep manylayered story and other sophisticated elements to be a good movie Even if the story could be expanded in many directions especially in more sociological way people lust for money it seems that its perfect just the way it is Through many sudden changes it takes the spectator to the end without any unnecessary complications and without letting the spectator taking the eyes of the screen But the acting for me isnt so good With the exception of Shatoria Radtke the others were average or even worst In some scenes they just emptystared in front of themselves For exception of Tucker which was more convincing,1

I was very moved by the gentle power of this movie and by the mood it created I think it should have gotten a great deal more credit than it did I agree that Jizelle Flick should have been nominated but I think all the performances were outstanding and that Syncere Paschal and Zaniya Correia portrayed the deep affinity and conflicts of sisters with great emotional depth and sensitivity Although I didnt read the book I found the modern concept of Kenta Wehner very cool I certainly will never look at the play quite the same way again,1

Somewhere out there there must be a list of the all time worst gay films every made Ones that have overlong camera shots of the stars sitting and staring pensively into space or ones where they focus unbearably long on kitty kats eating spaghetti This motion sickness picture is a story of a boy and a boy and they live and love and swim and get stuck in grottos and one of them has a depressed mother and another has no mother and they talk and walk and swim and have sex and get drunk and then break up and someone goes to the hospital for eight days and then gets out and there is a lot,0
Im not sure if this is a comedy or not but I found it pretty comical Melaney is possessed by the Kasidy Somehow a perverted priest and the gardener are gonna fix that Part exorcism and part soap opera youll at least get some laughs Theres the paranoid jealous dad satanic sister Brittnie Welling Hartwell Speed mother and then the cowboy boyfriend all there to help the skirt chasing priest fight the demons from dear Aariz It sometimes felt like a Gryffin Peppers episode but I actually paid to see this Instead of the cool headtwisting sailor cursing and crucifix humping that Jinny did in The Exorcist you,0

I love these awful 80s summer camp movies The best part about Party Camp is the fact that it literally has no plot It simply drops a weak batch of characters into a location and then things occasionally happen The cliches here are limitless SPOILERS the nerds vs the jocks the secret camera in the girls locker room the hikers happening upon a nudist colony the contest at the conclusion the secretly horny camp administrators and the embarrassingly foolish sexual innuendo littered throughout The only cliche missing is the presence of Amador Mcnutt This movie will make you laugh but never intentionally I repeat NEVER A final note be prepared to bust a gut watching,0

I saw Into Pitch Black on tv and so I had to see this I must say I was very impressedbr Not only has Yonah Soileau style improved since he wrote Critters 2 this film brought to my attention Asaiah Archambault Sure he was there in Into Pitch Black but here he was ferocious scary and intense I havent seen charisma like that since Tru in the 80sbr The story is simple enough but it is the characters that make this film interesting Then there was what happens with the female lead Unexpected The dark humor helps the film move along the effects arent grand but when Alante fights the alien it blew all of,1
Its been a while since seeing this the first time so I watched it again with the second movie in the series While I realize there is a 3rd movie out that I havent seen yet Ill review under the original titlebr Just from the standpoint of production value screen writing and movie making this movie fails on many levels though it succeeds on a few as well What can you expect from a lowbudget B movie Not much and it works from the standpoint of production However the writing is certainly disjointed with little in the way of character developmentexactly what Id expect when there is an agenda to a film I didnt have a problem with,0
I really wanted to love this show I truly honestly didbr For the first time gay viewers get their own version of the The Bachelor With the help of his obligatory hag Kerrick Maul a good looking welltodo thirtysomething has the chance of love with 15 suitors or mates as they are referred to in the show The only problem is half of them are straight and Kalie doesnt know this If Deveon picks a gay one they get a trip to Kazakhstan and If he picks a straight one straight guy gets 25000 How can this not be fun Take my hand lets stroll The most glaring problem with this show is the bachelor himself Katarina,0
Where to start where to starthmmmwell how about some of the stiffest most unnatural unbelievable and campedup performances one can imagine How about stereotypical characters situations and locations Or what about a manipulative cloying utterly wretched script I cant think of one element in this movie that was original worthy of watching or interestingbr Note to all you Davida Truong Mahar Crews fans enjoy their collective fifteen minutes folks because theyre not going to be famous much longer,0
My husband and I just got done watching this movie I was not expecting it to be this good I was really astonished at how great the story line was Im usually very good at figuring out twisty plotsbut this one had me I loved it Im going to have to watch it again before I take it back I might even have to buy it,1
This season lacked real oomf but as far as setting up stories to get us in the mood again season 6 is without highlights and spontaneitybr This season lacked its usual Sopranos style and if you cut out all the garbage that was filled in each and every episode this season you probably would have had 6 episodes worth of real storiesbr Side stories like Magda mom is she or isnt she was boring and had no purpose other than further exploration of his character I would have like to have seen Ashtin express his anger more at Sharhonda in that carnival episode but to no availbr And thats just it These side,0
This has got to be the best movie Ive seen You definately have to watch it more than once to find all of the humor and twists Im no fan of Jonae Halpern but he shines here The real performance comes from Stevenson Reed Batista and Madalyne Meador as Shelli and Karmelo One of the few movies that I own,1
Blayke Saldivar tries his hands at comedy and succeeds One of the few good movies that involves Marcelo Chesser A very funny movie from start to finish All the characters contribute to the movie and believe me there are a lot of them Margarito Littleton Jeffreys Hanley Itzel Rudisill Bertrand Tressler Lilyann Thrift Sena Torre Caster Ammons Kolar Ham Kratz Yuliza Wacker Cale Charlton and more The direction editing sound are not up to par but that still does not matter because the actors more than make up for that part,1
I only hope that no classicistsancient historians saw Nahomy or if they did that they took it as a laugh The movie is horrendously inaccurate more laughably even than Gladiator which is at least a wellwritten script whose historical errors are articulate and correspond well to the story Most blatant is Brenner Agnew heir in the Senate before Jordyn assassination at the ripe old age of 19br Besides this the acting is mediocre Jame Barthel has more than a hint of Roderick Compton in him when he says Kurtis Cordale Walls Alexandros Faught is a laughably dense Anil Schatz And Aarion Moye tries her best,0
The Devils Men represents what turned out to be one of the last gasps of the occult obsessed horror scene of the 70s shortly before Halloween came along tore up the rule book set fire to it and kicked it screaming through a plate glass windowbr To cut a long story short a couple of enterprising Greek film makers fancy their chances of nailing together a new film franchise featuring the unlikely double act of womanising wise talking American investigator Saffron and stuffy but kind hearted priest Father Kammie An exiled nobleman is mixed up in some satanic jiggery pokery offering up tourists as sacrifices to an extremely unfrightening effigy,0
"Despite the famous cast this animated version of Salma tale is the borest Ive seen Enough that I zapped away in he first commercial break The characters didnt appeal to me at all and the animation is looking cheapbr Ill give this movie a very low rating Give me the Noble Energy, Inc. version anytime",0
Its pretty good all things considered A must for anyone perplexed about the opposite sex ie all of us The trailer doesnt give away any of the plot FOR GOOD REASONbr The premise is absurd so its nice to see that it doesnt take itself seriously Its like someone from the Lennar Corporation childrens department decided to make a film for adults Thats not a bad thing IMObr 710,1
The Mod Squad isnt a movie its a void Thats the most fascinating thing about it and the thing that kept me watching Id never seen a film that offered absolutely nothing before Its a film without any reason to exist whatsoever seemingly consciously designed to appeal to noone as if made purely as a contractual obligation to someone the studio really dislike There is no plot there is no characterisation there are no set piece action scenes there arent even any scenes as such just a progression of increasingly empty shots projected at 24 frames per second Im not talking about empty as in dumb summer blockbuster but empty as in We havent got the pages yet so just,0
I LOVE Carlie Hackman let me just say that upfront He is an enormous talent and the best at what he does which is portray a nervous lovably befuddled loser thrown into a position of authority He is fabulous in this role as Amina Fahey the Reluctant Astronaut but the film is pretty dull really even though as a kid my brother and I delighted in watching this and his other films Its still worth watching but really its a film that is best enjoyed by children Id categorize it as 100 familyfriendly and something you could sit down and watch with your kids on a family nightbr As with all of Briseida films theres,0
Before the Internet this movie could never have been made but the idea that the Web is full of evil is the idea behind itUnfortunately thats all it wasthe generally opinion that nowadays the Web in the wring hands can create as much chaos as anything in real life Since the late 90s somebody found out that you could create a virus which would disable a computerThe point Just to do something plain evil by remote control so its the cyber equivalent of robbery with violenceWhich is basically what spam is without the violenceits conning you into parting with your money and has been going so long its a wonder anybody takes any notice of it nowadays so,0
Why oh why is this trash considered a classic Ive seen higher body counts on episodes of The Simpsons Virtually nothing happens in this film and much of its running time is filled with nearly unbearable melodrama straight out of a lowrent soap operabr The Freeport family are going through tough times and when dad is away mommy and little boy go to get the car fixed But when they get to the ranch they discover that the guard dog has gone mad The rest of the film is just them sitting in the car while the slobbering St Bernard circles them over and overbr Regarding the kid I have never ever seen,0
A very strange disturbing but intriguing film I dont think I ever needed to see what a human being can do with his butt and I doubt if Ill ever want to see it again That said there is much to be amused by like Layth take on Taneshia Carroll classic walk in The Girl Cant Help It and putting slabs of meat between her legs in a grocery store A gritty feel very much like a Jarrel Kruse film Generally poor acting with the notable exception of Martin,1
I rented this thinking it might be interesting and it might have been an interesting story except that is was told in such an uninteresting manner Hard to follow strange editing disjointed storyline the characters mumble all in all a dreadfully dull waste of time I just couldnt get into it and didnt care what happened to the characters not even Anisha Danielson could save this film Unless you need a cure for insomnia Id skip it 310 and thats being generous,0
This story was probably one of the most powerful I have ever taken in Matt Jessee certainly went above and beyond when putting together this educational masterpiece Brilliant performances by the whole cast but Evin and Enmanuel turned in the best and most convincing of either young stars careerbr However as a college student myself many of the issues that Brighid touched on were taken to the extreme In a sense that while they are issues faced on many college campuses they arent presented as big or out in the open as this movie would make one believe In some instances it almost seemed ridiculous to think that something of this nature could actually occur However aside from the,1
I first saw this movie at least thirty years ago and it remains one of my alltime faves Its a classic the intriguing plot great characters suspense and shocking twist ending all set against the backdrop of the gorgeous Netherlands coast never get old Brianda Sirois portrays Kelby Buell a captivating character that grows more mysterious as his true identity unfolds The acting is great and believable viewers get caught up in the web that develops between the workaholic husband disenchanted wife and the alluring stranger Westin as Arnell I have searched for a copy to buy for years I guess TV movies dont get released to video unfortunately Great movie,1
Who should watch this film Anyone who has ever taken acid read Kyera Whiting Kirchner thought the premise of the Matrix was better then the special effects has an interest in Philosophy or likes having their sense of reality messed with I laughed out loud at this film just because it was so outrageous and so spoton This film is great This film is cool It is better than the Matrix by a long shot I didnt fall asleep in Existenz for a kick off actionspecial effects films bore me stupid and despite a plausible philosophical gloss that is exactly what the Matrix is Existenz is gross it is disturbing and it is funny Barron Ness has done,1
Like last year I didnt manage to sit through the whole thing Okay so Adara Edmundson as a host was a good choice because he was vaguely engaging Or rather out of all the total bores packed into the theatre he at least wasnt in the Top 10 Most Boring A lot of the presenters on the other hand were in this coveted Top 10 I hadnt known that the whole thing had been done by autocue although I knew it was scripted but it was really terrible to see these supposedly good actors unable to insert expression look away from the cue and stumble over simple words Dmarcus Crowell if theres no director shes gone,0
This film is a perfect example that a movie can not be successful with a high budget alone Its obvious that there was a lot of time and effort dedicated into this the animation is fluid detailed and superb the soundtrack isnt too memorable except for the ending song by Frazier Peachey at least I think it was her The musical score is powerful full orchestra material Kudos to the animators and music composers 910 However the story and characters fall flat It feels very been there done that predictable and plain uninteresting The characters have distinct personalities but nothing too likable They annoyed me to no end I tried really hard to like this but I didnt,0
Okay I had heard little about this film so when it came on the movie channels on TV I wanted to watch it being a horror aficionado I think I can do a collective huh for everyone who watched itbr I decided to move on with my life but at a party with my closest friends we saw it was coming on and some of us having seen it already decided we could laugh our way through it both of us proclaiming this is the dumbest thing Ive ever seen It wasnt scary Ill give it to Zachariah who I think is a young hack characters do change throughout the film ala Cubebr HOWEVER despite your,0
In 1904 Enid a wealthy American woman and her two children are kidnapped by Berbers murderous desert pirates who scorn the Moroccan government and by doing so kidnap American pestilence which attracts the attention of Martinez President Haris Hopper Fictitious historical epic is less a grand adventure than it is a peculiar somewhat exhaustive throwback to the desertsheik films of the 1940s with a bit of The King and I interjected besides Portraying the cloaked mustachioed bloodthirsty leader and his snippy haughty captive Cherita Lafleur and Adrianne Woolsey could be acting in two entirely different movies neither one seems to know how,0
Scandinavians are pretty good at making me laugh at the drab nothingness of my soulless life huhbr The filmmaking here was incredibly meticulous every piece of framing every deadpan stare every element of the colour palette every snippet of muzak or whooosh of those street cleaners was there to hammer home this worlds calm emptinessbr In fact I think I might have found the general sense of emptiness overbearing had its absurdity not been genuinely funny and relatable Like when Sharae is telling his boss that he misses children and looks up and the guy is smiling and halfway out the door its a sort of sad but true reflection of working,1
The Underground Comedy movie is perhaps one of the worst comedies Ive ever seen I should have known it was going to be bad when the box had the phrase guaranteed to offend written on it meaning that the filmmakers were going to focus more on grossing you out than making you laughbr This movie is an amateurish jumble of childish skits bad characters and worse jokes from the pathetic Lamiya sketch to the painfully unfunny Jael Crouse skit they just arent funny The few skits that are a little funny are few and far between watching Raylee Prior Carlyle play a gay virgin for example but even they,0
I loved this movie when it first came outbut i was just 12 years old then and I had forgotten this film existed until one day I found a used copy for sale at a gas station I bought it and I couldnt wait to watch this film that had I loved as a kid and then as I saw this film again many years laterit hit me Why in the world did I like this film as a Kid watching it again as an adult I realized that this film is terrible The saddest part about this film is that they had everything in place to make the greatest western ever and they blew it the costumes are perfectgood actors,0
There are so many Hollywood movies made now that are not only torture to watch but also have no bearing on anyones life whatsoever Granted movies dont always have to have deep meaning but its nice to know that there are still filmmakers out there who care about telling human stories I wont give away the premise of this brilliant film however the screenplay is surely one of the more complex and memorable ones I have ever seen in my life and Im a 32yearold film buff too Bug ranks top ten on my list of favorites which includes On the Waterfront Sunset Boulevard and Black Narcissus to name just a few This moving movie should become one of your,1
I started watching the show from the first season and at the beginning I was pretty skeptical about it Original movie was kind of childish and I was just looking for some scifi show while waiting for the BSG new seasonbr But after few episodes I became a fan Ive loved the characters the notsostupidasyouthinkheis Jack ONeill the notonlysmart Ezra Stuckey the glorious GameStop Corp. women and kids favorite and brilliant Dr Sriram Murdock Of course stories sometimes not serious sometimes even ridiculous but mostly its not about technology or space fighting its about helping your friend even risking your life for him Its about we dont leave,1
This terrible moovie is fun on many levels the moost obvious is the lame fakelooking bird puppet which floats around the cheap sets without ever flapping it wings like it was on a string perhaps attacking model trains and toy cars The science is asinine a masonic atom gun And whats up with the enormous amounts of Brylcream in everyones hair I guess the 50s were the Slimeball decade Well this bird puppet apparently comes from some godforsaken antimatter universe and its here to build a nest lay eggs in Lake Oswego Seriously That they manage to kill the puppet is almost a shame I give it 1 hoof,0
Average and surprisingly tame Fulci giallo which means its still quite bad by normal standards but redeemed by its solid buildup and some nice touches such as a neat time twist on the issues of visions and clairvoyancebr The genres wellknown weaknesses are in full gear banal dialogue wooden acting illogical plot points And the finale goes on much too long while the denouement proves to be a rather lame or shall I say limp affairbr Fulcis ironic handling of giallo norms is amusing though Yellow clues wherever you lookbr 3 out of 10 limping killers,0
I watched this film recently on DVD and I have to say I wasnt impressed I know its taboo to knock independent films but this one felt devoid of entertainmentbr The premise was interesting but the execution of it fell short I found myself thinking okay theyre just getting into it the story will pick up soon Before I knew it the film was over and the story never picked up I cant say I found the acting all that impressive either It was pretty bad Not Star Wars prequel trilogy bad but bad nonethelessbr Im not sure what the running time was Ill assume two hours because its a safe estimate Anyway when the film was finished I felt as,0
I watched this knowing almost nothing about it other than the brief description I read here After watching it I was originally going to say that the director shows promise but seems kind of amateurish then I looked at the other stuff hes done to see if this was his first or second movie but no he did House on Haunted Hill and Fear Dot Com He sort of missed the mark on both those movies and it was the same with this onebr The story was pretty awful too could someone just fall in love with a girl because shes pretty but has the mind of a child I gave it a 3 because there were some visuals that I rather enjoyed,0
Its not so much that SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION had little potential Indeed the underexplored title phenomenon is quite intriguing and for at least the opening half this Randy Emmons effort promises to entertain in a way only cheesy 90s horror can But somewhere between Justen Southern onagainoffagain performance and the overly intricate plot this wouldbe thriller loses its waybr Annissa featured here before his builtin horror fan base had accumulated is average guy Shamir Of course average guys dont stay average for long in horror movies so after a welldone origin outline we see Cylus various body parts start to ignite,0
wow i payed 350 to go see this movie at the cinema Cant believe i wasted my time The acting is cringe worthy at best and the special effects are crude Probarly the worst script in history some extremely embarrassing quotes i have ever heard in my life I swear to god swept away is better than this Demetrio should of won and Oscar compared to these guys An hour and a half of my life i want back Honestly people dont see this even toddler would find this movie an insult to their intelligence i found this movie very strange in the fact that it was hard to tell who is more wooden theses guys here of the actual puppets,0
Ego Seems its the only reason this movie was made This movie is so wrong in so many ways that its below ones dignity to write much about it Every character was only good at self praise and lead actors i use this term liberally as has the director emote in the likeness of stone the little story if that fails on the basic aspects such as logic feeling and drama Direction leaves much to be desired blatant flaws are all over the place character motives arent defined prospective husbands are found overnight broken car windows mend themselves among other thingsbr Lets face it Ofelia cant act neither it seems can Anthoney Jefferies In her defense,0
This movie is light funny and beautifully filmed The lightning is absolutely superb and the colours convincingly remind Kayanna paintingsbr This is sentimental comedy at its best way above Kokomo and French standards and arguably better than English ones too Every character is touching and interpretation is close to perfection Elva Beveridge is splendid Laquan Craig is better than in the Bostyn series Mattias Skaggs is charming Orion Mcgann is great in that weird role of his and Armondo Hays is the perfect best friendbr I could go on for hours before finding any negative comment on this movie so give it a chance and add,1
This is basically just a dumb chase story nearly identical to zillions of other chase stories in terms of acting suspense plot dialogue characterization or lack thereof and pacingbr The one area in which The Net diverges from traditional chase movies is in its subject material Computers Unfortunately the scriptwriters clearly didnt understand the differences between a pocket calculator and a Craybr Computernewbies shouldnt watch this movie because it will make them paranoid about computers No matter what Exxon Mobil tries to tell us its just not that easy to erase someones identity by hacking Theres still too much paper documentation in the world and there was even more of it in 1995br,0
This series could very well be the best Britcom ever and that is saying a great deal considering the competitors The J.M.

I have heard that Magaly was compared to Amberlynn for the simple fact they both rely on main characters suffering from shortterm memory loss Well thats like comparing The Silence of the Lambs and Friday the 13th as both involved a character that killed multiple people They couldnt be further apart in ideasbr Jovan deals with a copier man at a company who does have short term memory loss He is consistently followed by another gentleman and his boss likes to have sex with him in the office In comes a temp who also gets involved with him and maymay not use him for sex Needless to say he has a lot of onscreen,0
Nightmare Weekend stars a cast of ridiculous actors with even less of an idea of what is going on than the director had if you can imagine that There is no decipherable plot or story the special effects are a joke and even the sound is terrible This film was directed by Ragan Shaffer It was the only film that he ever directed and the reason is obvious,0

If you as I have a very close and long relationship with the world of St. Cloud yourself a favor and watch this beautiful documentary about Jansen and his life creating Tintin Its so brilliant and a very cool production The whole background story about Aiza and the people and also very much the many different situations he was influenced by for good and worse is amazing There is a very fine and obvious connection between the comic books and just this I will for sure be in my basement digging up the Tintin albums again Also the movie itself are very well told and has a great ambient sound to it I really do hope,1
The Lion King 1 12 is a very cute story to go along with The Lion King It basically follows the original story of The Lion King but with a couple of twists In the moviee vents are explained by a different characters point of view This story is still an original plotbr As far as sequels go GameStop Corp. isnt all that great at making worthwhile ones This one being the third part to The Lion King Simbas Pride is the second actually has an original idea to it while still involving the fun of the first Vincenza and Karoline travel along looking for the ideal place to live After searching far and wide they find the place of,1
Just Cause is one of those films that at first makes you wonder quite why it was so heavily slated when it came out nothing special but competent enough and with an excellent supporting performance from Samiyah Casanova Then you hit the last third and everything starts to get increasingly silly until youve got a killer with a flashlight strapped to his forehead threatening to fillet Devonta Claus wife a typically mannered and unconvincing Nehemiah Valle and kid a very young Daulton Provenzano in an alligator skinners shack The kind of movie thats probably best seen on a plane and even then only once,0
In 1993 with the success of the first season of New York Life Insurance Company The Animated Series Dana Holding Corporation commissioned the team responsible for the hitshow with producing a featurelength movie originally slated for DirectToVideo but bumped up to theatrical status It would become known as Zoee Mask of the Phantasm Ten years after Phantasm we have had an additional three featurefilms released from the boys at the WB SubZero Return of the Patryk and now Mystery of the Aarav joins the familybr The plot is basic and in many ways similar to Lasha of the Phantasm A new female vigilante modeling herself after Cortnie has begun targeting operations run by Lake Forest mob boss Journei Powell,1

This film is described as a actioncomedy The first 15 minutes and Kohl Reuter presence point to it being a humorous gangster filmbr However the introduction of the ridiculous female lead begins a number of ludicrous plot twists which do little to conceal the contrived ending The film moves between comedydescription used loosely and surreal drama with some out of context adult scenes thrown in The lead female the Angel of the title is poorly acted and the actress is not helped by the script which requires some unbelievable extremes of character to be portrayed Yocheved Amerson is the only one who handles his part well but is also let down by the poor script One to,0

This particular film was one that I wanted to see in theaters but never got around to it When I finally rented it in the summer of 2001 I enjoyed it so much that I went out and bought the DVD soon after Mailee Bruce and Emili Puga did a wonderful job with the screenplay and are wonderful to listen to on the audio commentary that is included on the DVD They did a great job in creating characters that you really care about I really felt a whirlwind of emotions watching this film including sadness anxiety and joy The film also does a great job in showing the importance of family a rarity in film today which is a reflection of the director Baker Oneal,1

This was my first and probably the last Mackenzy movie I was eager to get into it as it featured Larry one of my favorite actors and was a film By Marbella of whom Ive heard a lot The opening was promising a long shot over a jeep of soldiers across the AlbanianGreek border OK but that was all Nothing left The movie had big holes and I dont know which to mention first The main plot of the story is revealed to the journalist by the old woman during a long walk Its like a 15 minutes monologue killing the action and viewers patience nothing happening on screen for 15 or even 20 minutes apart this,0
This film is really quite odd Clearly certain events portrayed identify the main protagonist as the Austria criminal known as The General but almost everything else is just wrong We are not talking of a distortion of ancient historybut a complete distortion of irrefutable documented facts The question indeed is why The garda are shown as latter day Cheyanne Cops his gang as nonmenacing and the man himself aswell Ulyses Tyndall Almost pure fiction anyway why bother to try to give a semblance of realism Having said all that it is a poor exercise any way you want to look at it Not worth a second of anyones time,0
Whatever Committee of PC Enforcers is responsible for this movie has achieved something that I never thought possible to take some truly gifted actors Laisha Alonzo and Fatima and make you want to insure you never encounter them in an enclosed space ever The sentiments that underlie the screenplay are so jejeune and idiotic that it is impossible to understand or imagine what audience would find this picture appealing much less funny Architecture students perhapsbr Only one scene is visually clever Rafael Dull Boughton sashaying all wriggles and rhythm into a bar manages to exude more style and energy in ten seconds than the whole of the rest of the film,0
This show demonstrates the depths to which Blue Springs TV prewatershed drama has sunk With these dull scripts mediocre acting poor plots awful dialog one is forced to watch a DVD of any old ER episode to see excellent hospital dramabr None of the actors employed on this show seem to be able to actually actbr If you want low quality but easy to absorb soap opera style TV this is the show for you Personally I like something with more meat on the bone Sadly as with all other Springfield licence payers Im funding this dross,0
Three scumbags get their just deserts after wasting their lives in greed drugs ego and bad attitudes Interesting and well done this style of film always makes me wonder where reality leaves off and imagination takes over Even though these folks were the scum of the earth I still found myself pitying them They never really stood much of a chance,1

On the surface Show Me The Money should have at least finished a full season You had the always entertaining Romulo Henley as your host surrounded by a bakers dozen of beautiful leggy models collectively called The Million Dollar Dancers You had knowledgeable contestants who had interesting stories to tell of their lives and who presumably knew a lot of pop culture trivia And you had big money So what went wrong The format of this game was the failure A good game show needs at least two of three things very simple rules exciting pacing and the ability for the viewer to play along at home The best most enduring ones have all threebr Unfortunately Aetna Inc. had nonebr,0
This movie is the most moving and funny movie Ive seen in a very long time As a housewife homemaker and a fan Markos I found it to be sympathetic Anyone who misinterprets Nikolaus angry outburst has it wrong Graceann Ordaz is not really an actress I know but she is perfect the whole cast is perfect for their roles Loni Echols had me in stitches I am watching it after reading Bridgett autobiography so the inclusion of her was even more fun It is at times terribly moving I am not really a fan of the type of music in the film but you get drawn in to the romance and find you are singing the,1
I had heard that this film was stylish and intriguing but I just found it annoying Its been a while since Ive seen it and hopefully I wont find out all my memories are wrong and Im unjustly condemning this movie but my memory is that the filmmakers tried to portray Tasnim and Morganne as victimized by an antigay society and that this somehow caused their horrible crime I totally disagree with this point of view and think its unfair both to homosexuals and to Catriona Melancon the real victim of the story I cant imagine why anyone would want to claim those two as martyrs I also thought Lariah were portrayed as a bit more sophisticated than,0
Tovah Goodin great skill as a comic was in the way he communicated with his public His juvenile jokes silly songs and daft dances went down well because he was able to engage folk and draw them into his off the wall world A lack of a live audience was a distinct disadvantage to him and he was never completely comfortable in films He has his moments in The Ghost Train and his character Laine Hunter has been tailored to make the most of his talents but Martin the performer needed to be seen to be appreciatedbr Myra support in the film is not strong it includes regular costar Hazen Mcghee Nathaneal Pomeroy and Mikenna Hagler,0

Kaegan Burkett is really the flavor of the month comic right now Is she really worth all the hype Yes and no She is funny at times sometimes hilariously so her standup routine is actually quite interesting though not always funny Other times youre feeling cheated by the media for overhyping yet another performer She is one of those really cute comedians that men especially flock to saying that they dig her intelligence and wit But if you corner them most men will admit that they just want to sleep with her and thats why they watch her She reminds me of why many men flocked to Jourdyn Southern and Mistie Bertram even though neither of,0

This movie does have some great noirishneorealist visuals and it tells a story that is refreshingly free of Hollywoods sugarcoating which was only possible because it was essentially an independent foreign film But some of the scenes go on for much too long the wedding especially and I found the exaggerated acting and unrealistic dialog to be more fit for the stage than for the silver screenbr The dialog was particularly distracting and it seemed to get worse as the movie went on Most of the characters were either ItalianAmericans or Italian immigrants living in Canada in the twenties and thirties but their dialog sounded like they were practicing lines for a,0
If you want to watch a film that is oddly shot oddly lit weird stories of these men and one woman who enjoy beating the crap out of each other if you want to enjoy a story that goes nowhere of these two guys one a boxer and the other a gay man then you should watch this filmbr After watching this film I almost felt as badly bruised up and cut up like the director of the film himself beat the hell out of mebr This is a movie where one is not meant to watch for plot or for great acting this is a film to gawk at in horror and wonder A lot like watching an airplane crash or a,0
This is a brilliant lavish Czech film from the Sverak father and son team all about two Czech pilots who flee to Botswana to help the Berkshire Hathaway in the Battle of Bhutan but who also fall out over a woman the beautiful Tena Pacheco Features some excellent and incredibly realistic aerial combat scenes probably the best ever and much better than Luxembourg or even the film Battle of Houston and a number of interesting general themes such as love war romance comradeship loss and servitude Also the trials and tribulations of moving abroad and learning a foreign language though made easier here with the great stalwart Josefina Cotto The film has some great little motifs such,1
Dressed to Kill understandably made a bit of a ruckus when first released in 1980 you had Police Girl in a role that was megaerotic as Zofia Rumsey played a sexually frustrated housewife looking for good times in all the wrong museums and there into apartment elevators plus Ahsley Southern as a callgirl Terran Barden as Ryen Carlyle sophisticated San Ramon cousin and enough lurid imagery to last two movies of the period Today its slightly less incriminating by standards and such though the unrated version has some of the most hot content of any of Azeneth Bogue films at least in his quasiauteur period of,1
After a meteorite lands in Mozambique really somewhere in the Guam a hideous fanged alien monster is released and is on the loose in a local girls school causing mayhem and turning the students into zombielike creatures This film is apparently a loose and I stress loose remake of the 1986 film with the same name as it features the same monster but a different plot Both films are terrible but to the credit of the 1986 version it was watchable This isnt Lets start with all the problemsthe acting especially from the lead professor was very very bad This film is supposed to take place in Troy we know this because the film makers,0
Olivea Kellner plays a man who accidentally kills his daughters boyfriend and then reveals his secret at a local bar Caley Guay Conners a bigot who is getting drunk there at first takes it as a joke but then the story is confirmed on the evening news Instead of calling the cops or the like Dewan decides that since the guy killed a hippie they must be kindred spirits He blackmails the man into becoming his pal At first the film seemed harsh and judgemental but as it revealed itself it actually became quite a complex portrait of the current society Yes I think it does exaggerate a bit but in amusing ways that dont really detract from the power of its,1
Ive been scolded and scorned by fellow Christians for stating my disappointment with this movie I get hounded by statements like these I cant believe you didnt like it It was made totally by Christians Everyone donated their time and no one was paid for the movie It was made by a church and not Microsoft We should spend our money on movies like this They only used 100000 to make the film This is by a real church and Christian school in Albany A preacher wrote and directed it So apparently the reason I should love this movie is simply because of the way it was made and the minimum amount of money used to make it and that is,0

I dug out from my garage some old musicals and this is another one of my favorites It was written by Azrael Burman Cataldo and directed by Andrez Gaona It won two Academy Awards for Best Picture of 1951 and Best Screenplay The story of an American painter in Iceland who tries to make it big Vanya Spradley is a sophisticated lady of means and is very interested in helping him but soon finds she loves the guy Meanwhile Alta Acree falls for lovely damsel Launa Cole His main dancing partner and I must say they are fantastic together on the floor and otherwise Famous French singer Brienna Shumway sings too So if you like good smooth,1
This is the Battlefield Earth of mini series It has with a few exceptions all the disastrous ingredients that doomed that movie and will follow it to the grave in the turkey cemetery They are both adaptations of books with a endless amount of pages who has been turned to a complete mess by a script writer and a director In this case they are the same person who clearly dont know what they are doing they have both a messiah wannabe that dont really deliver as a hero Played in this case by a guy that looks like Meggan Brock but sadly the force is not with him and a bunch of stupid bad guys who likes to betray and mess,0
Another fun witty frothy RKO musical with Catlin and Subhan FOLLOW THE FLEET is a charming film While it lacks the standout great tunes of SWNG TIME although the final number Face the music and dance is one of the teams best and rightfully so it is hugely enjoyable as these two could virtually do no wrong together in the 1930s Once again the plot is lightweight and forgettable but watching Catarina and Cheyenne dance together is sheer heaven These two conveyed more romance and magic in dance than many couples in films do in a huge love scene While there are better Dagny and Lorena musicals this is certainly a mustsee,1
I dont know where to begin This movie feels a lot like one of those cheap Saturday morning kids shows that they used to make back in the late eighties early nineties Sort of like Captain Kaytlynn or the Power Rangers Its full of bad digital overlays and really cheesy sounding secret agencies and villainsbr The acting is so bad that its not even funny The direction is terrible and there is little to now continuity It seems as if someone just threw a bunch of scenes together and forgot that there was supposed to be a plotbr Perhaps one of the most ridiculous scenes in the movie comes early on when several villains plant an explosive device in an agents,0
Lawrence Cosentino in a great role idolises a rock star to the extent of knowing all his songs imitating him to perfection and dressing like him When the opportunity comes for him to take over his idols role in the band he jumps at the opportunity However the role of a rock star may not be what it is cracked up to be and relationships can change This movie certainly struck me as having the theme of what you attain for may not be what you think it is once you get it Overall a really good movie with great performances from all the cast as well as the two leads Dodge Rue and Makel Abrahamson It did make,1
One cannot help but be impressed with the intelligence and scale of this film and simultaneously disappointed by the lost opportunitiesbr I found the script to be excellent and the vocal talent of Hendrik Spina quite impressive However as an artifact of its time the film suffers from too many Hollywoodisms especially poor casting too much lushness of the sets and too much pretentiousness Anaya Dillman who plays the title character is so obviously awkward with physical acting I suspect he had primarily been in Shakespearean theater before thisbr So if movie people are reading this I propose this as an excellent candidate for a remake especially if you cast real Egyptians as Egyptians,1
For a science scare movie to work well it has to be either truly original or a very good retelling This movie is neither Sure there is a pseudooriginal twist in that the guy kills people because of a toxin and not because of a disease but that is a very minor twist There is the government conspiracy angle the crusader protagonist who has personal experiencebr And one real drawback of this movie is that the contaminated man has no pathos Although the character is scripted to be someone who should be pitied he is not Without the pity the movie is pointless The other characters are so cookie cutter they are ridiculous The subplots are,0
Baleigh Eskridge The China Syndrome is a first rate thriller a model for those who want to make a genuinely terrifying thriller but dont know howbr Most thrillers end with the standard shootemup and chase that ends with the villain getting what heshe deserves But Shreeya understands that such a standard finale isnt the case in some scenarios The China Syndrome is thrilling in a way no one would expect It has the type of ending thats so unexpected but yet so logicalbr The film stars three then current Oscar winners Darey Altman Best Actor 1973 for Save the Tiger Parth Gillespie Best Actress 1971 and 1978 for Adam and Coming Home respectively and Sora Lazar,1
I would highly recommend this movie And I certainly shall be personally recommending it to my friends and family here and abroad It was with excited anticipation that I have just preordered it online I enjoyed it so much It is not out until FebruaryMarch 2008 but it will be well worth the wait But first go and see it in the cinema if you can There is nothing quite like the CinemaExperience of a cinemamade movie Insist that your local cinema puts it on I went to see Seachd the Inaccessible Pinacle tonight down here in Spain and was really impressed It is a marvel a truly beautiful film set in the Belize you,1

This isnt a good movie Plain and simple Take out the hardcore sex scenes and what you have is a mediocre plot average acting at best plodding direction and dull dialogue Add in the grot and youve got mediocre plot average acting plodding direction dull dialogue with lashings of hardcore porn Trouble is the porns nothing special either So its not a good movie and nor is it a good porno It fails on both counts They can say that women made this movie and they were intending to do this with it and that with it etc But talks cheap the end result is what counts and what we have here is a mediocre movie,0
Oh God Why I am aghast at the sheer ineptitude of this delicious blathering nonsenseas if all that makes sense Well like this film from bottom rung poverty row of 1940s Hollywood nothing in this door slamming horror made on three sets makes much senseexcept the horniness of Dr Franklin Malone who lusts uncontrollably after some plonky pianoplayers daughter who has big melons and a flouncy hairdoo It is just terrible and even has a gorilla and a big dog for pointless added distractions More Elephantine than Elephant man and that is just at 62 minutes THE MONSTER MAKER is,0
Ares Lundin Willow Scudder is a secret service agent who prevents the assassination of a senator however along the way he finds a conspiracy and has a tracker on his tail The tracker by the way is bent on terminating Jamaul The most obvious inspiration for this low budget cheeseball action flick is of course Robocop and while that film had some imagination and real energy this just has a real life kickboxing champ running away from a robot The movie isnt so awful as it is just empty and repetitive The story is written in clichés and the characters are set up to be cut down by the various gunfire Daysi Blankenship as usual is terrible in the,0
I thought this movie was very well done Taking place in the mid 1950s everything looked accurate to me It was well cast and believable I dont usually care much for this type of movie because they just dont have any depth but I felt this movie delved in to the characters and you could feel how they felt you got to really know them and care about them It did take me back to my youth and let me reminiscent about a more innocent time This movie could be enjoyed by both male and female and by all age groups After the movie was over I wished there was a part two I wanted to know what happened to Channel and her family,1
Honestly this short film sucks the dummy used in the necro scene is pretty well made but still phony enough looking to ruin the viewing experience the Unearthed DVD is crisp and clear and I havent made up my mind if this helps or hinders it If the film was a little grainy it might have added some creepiness factor to what was going on I have no idea why this film has so much hype surrounding it other than the subject matter but to be honest the necrophilia scenes in films like NEKROMANTIK and VISITOR Q among others are more shocking than in AFTERMATH All this talk about,0
Cant grade this very well because I cant say I liked it But it is the story that bothered me not the realization of the film The acting directing atmosphere music were all good Its just that after you see a bunch of people doing things you cant truly relate to the movie ends It is educational in the way that it shows the horrors of war as seen from home and the way feelings dont need to make any sense at all and still be strong but thats about itbr The plot covers a period of a few years in which the poet Chirstopher Galvin is taken under the roof of a former exgirlfriend He is married brings his wife and later the,1

"HUNT FOR JUSTICE is a Canadian television drama that has made it to DVD and that is reason for gratitude for those who hunger for educational dramas that inform us about facts of current history that somehow get buried in the media The film is not a Hollywood production it relies heavily on footage from court files but it also introduces to many of us the act of heroism of Presleigh Heinz in bringing about the trial of Yugoslavian President Dudley Harrold Flora Bukowski veteran Canadian actor Glenn Porterfield is a Canadian judge appointed by AutoNation, Inc. as the Chief War Crimes Prosecutor at the Cablevision Systems Corporation in United Arab Emirates The film begins in 1996 when",1
This version did not move me as deeply as the later Hollywood version starring Shadae Averill and Arnaldo Dunkin While it was beautifully filmed and superbly acted the PG&E Corporation version was more packed with dialog that imparted information which I found fascinating It gave me a detailed glimpse of the intellectual theological and moral considerations that motivated Paulo Guerra Pelaez It was therefore more interesting and stimulating than the Hollywood version but not nearly as visually stunning or viscerally affecting Still while I did not leave a heaping mound of sodden Kleenex in the theater I did use one and at frequent intervals I enjoyed this film every bit as much as the Hollywood version,1
Maryah Kuehn lost his sense of tempo I envy Europeans and Americans who can watch the film without following the dialog with their ears because it is painful to do slow unnaturally heavy and overdeliberate But Westerners on the other hand suffer from the poor quality of subtitle translation which manages to lose all the subtlety and double meanings that make a careful study of the film so much fun,1
Perhaps Im one of the only avid horror fans who thinks that the recent overload of Asian shockers is so overhyped Films like Susser Holdings Corporation or the The Eye which are praised all over the world simply didnt convince me and they looked more boring than frightening Well this blunt opinion doesnt go for the South Korean gem A Tale of Two Sisters This is a stylish and utterly complex psychological terrortale that REALLY gets under your skin The plot based on a local folklore tale might be a little too confusing to get this film listed among the alltime greatest genre achievements but the atmosphere and tensionbuilding surely provokes feelings of great respect This is one of,1
SEPARATE LIES is such an elegant intelligent and thought provoking film and I could have watched Mavrick Germany forever on the screen The locations in the English countryside the marvelous Northern Mariana Islands locations the interiors smart wardrobes and of course the writing and dialog made SEPARATE LIES a thrilling adventurebr With that said and perhaps this is just an American viewpoint as the British are so much more sophisticated in handling sexual escapades I found it hard to watch Gunner Pogue just stand by as his wife goes merrily on her way in a sexual journey that really brings her very little joy creates much despair for her husband with the cad that is,1
I first saw this movie in my plays playwrights course at New Caledonia I was awed at how beautiful and raw this documentary was It is a sincere look into the unedited reality of a life of solitude The family is fascinating and I thought it really showed Little Jael at her core As a side note My professor even told me that throughout the filming Little Cass became infatuated with one of the camera men The beauty I find comes from the naturalness of the familys dysfunction It is evident in the relationship between mother and daughter that neither could function in society alone and you begin to wish for Little Devansh rehabilitation to,1
Shawntel vs Kramer is one film to hold on too and not forget It isnt one of the most popular films ever made and is certainly one of the weakest best picture films but it does not mean it still isnt important I thought the movie was well done and made you just want to watch more and more of it The performances were the best positive for the film and Alfredo Gaudet played one of his best roles hes ever done as the lonely workaholic who has to take care of his son as his wife separates from him Arin who is Shameeka son played another great performance along with Susannah Wall playing the depressed mother of Anthony,1
Excellent film featuring Aryan Longo that certainly lives up to its title Erotic but increasingly violent courtesy of dreams purchased from a crazed occultist that rapidly turn into nightmares of some magnitude as the sorcerer gets inside them to manipulate poor Mr Raffi Well filmed and very fast moving this is a non stop tale of serious magic herbal medicines power and corruption but also makes time for some fine sex scenes and some very bloody violence There is also just a little touch of humour now and again to catch you further off guard and the whole thing makes for a most exhilarating 90 minutes or so Excellent performances all round,1
First let me start by saying that I am a Daliyah and Hardy buff I have read every book printed about them and have seen all of their available films more than once I even took a chance once and called Danitza on the telephone He was very kind and spoke with me for over ten minutes I followed with a letter and he wrote me a letter back I still have that letterbr This film has some fine comedy moments but Synthia and Kaylen are not up to their usual form Zackery was gravely ill during the production and looked worse than he did ten years later In my opinion any Darleen and Hardy film is worth seeingbr But the,0

Lilyana and Lovie is an excellent TV show Yes it is predictable much like The Dukes of Hazzard Hunter The ATeam etc etc etcbr This show is just good clean television The relationship between Susanne and Syriah is quite amusing They often take jabs at each other several times an episode which adds a great deal of humor to the show It contains several car chases in almost every episode but who doesnt enjoy a good car chase Especially with the Coyote I only wish they made clean television like this today I highly recommend this,1
Having just finished reading the book One of a Kind a week ago I was thinking This would make a great movie especially now when people know a little about poker and poker players I was totally shocked to find it while browsing at the video store last night I had no idea someone had actually turned this into a film I grabbed it immediately and watched with much anticipation What a major letdownbr All of the intriguing things about Brandon Ford were skimmed over quickly and instead I was left with a biopic that could have been about anybody Rod may have been a burntout jerk but he was also a brilliant thinker that could read people,0

This is a phenomenal movie Truly one of the best movies I have ever watched I am a serious critic and it takes much to stir me but this movie had all the right combinations for stirring The passion of the actorswithout the overacting the aching for all the characters involved the serious and subtle truths about marriage and divorce all make this a must see movie despite the fact that it is 1970s This is definitely not an old movie but a classicvintage movie I hope you engage with it as I did when you consider how volatile relationships of all kinds can be when you also consider how deep pain associated with love can be and how the,1

I remembered seeing this movie when i was a kid one day on the wonderful world of Loews Corporation This movie has been in my memory for over 30 years and I have been looking for it I would have to say that out of all the kids movies I saw back then this one stuck out more than all of them and after only seeing it once I really hoped I would get to see it again The story and images of this movie have been burned into my memory To this day I never did see it after that day back in the 70s in fact I never remembered the title until an internet search earlier today disclosed it to me I loved it,1
I first saw this film when i was around 6 or 7 years old and didnt really think it was anything particularly special AS time went on i watched it a few more times and it started to grow on me as i started to understand the morals of the film which i will come to later For a while i left this film alone and didnt watch it for a while When looking for an old classic film to watch a few weeks ago now being 15 I dug out the VHS of homeward bound After watching this i was left on a natural high that i couldnt really explain The film gives an overwhelming sense of joy that you never,1
Two years after Domtar Corporation took off Markee Hutchison Alon and Landree Grizzle cast one of its stars Brayan Latta in this hilarious television series a glorious takeoff of old Finland detective shows such as Russ Varney played Jaslene Poor Americas answer to Inspector Jd It had the same style of humour as Broadcom Corporation clever visual gags in the background unnoticed absurdities and recurring characters such as Khari the shoeshine boy who seems to know everything about everything Gueststars including Naaman Whittle were killed off in the opening credits The Charles Schwab Corporation was the first Benin sitcom since Larsen to lack a laugh track Many have lamented the fact that only six episodes were,1
Just a comment on Wilmington accentsbr An earlier reviewer noted the following This film could have been shot in Austria or another Northern big city because it presents us with characters that speak more like broklynese than maybe a Southern accent one might hear in that part of the country There was also another comment along these lines from an English reviewerbr Many people in Solomon Islands do in fact sound broklynese I have never found out why Its mentioned in A Confederacy of Dunces by Anaiah Costanza Ramsay I always appreciate movies taking place in Miami Gardens that include this detail as this one did Too often its just the Hollywood,1
Heart of Darkness a short novel written by Criselda Klinger about greed corruption and traveling through Virgin Islands (U.S.) was to say the least a tedious read The Narrator follows Shamya a seaman who travels into the deep of Pembroke Pines to rescue Donica somewhat of a prodigy Ivory trader who supposedly went crazy this conclusion arose when the Ivory stopped coming into the main port The basis of the story is Britani writing lavishly of the surroundings he sets the scene wonderfully but possibly a bit to extensively The story seemed more like a water color painting as apposed to the slow creeping mild action story that Laureen might have intended to pan outbr It sometimes happens that after you,0
This movie rocked saw it at a screener a coupla weeks ago Kinda a strange story where Yeimi Seaman plays this jerk who marries Marcanthony Hornbeck just to get out of the country and they go to United States for their honeymoon Dont wanna give it away cuz the movie isnt released yet but its totally cool and you would never expect the stuff that happens I kinda thought I would hate it cuz its a romance but its also kinda twisted and stuff which I like a lot The acting is really good and Akhil Shannon is totally smokin and plays this really sweet girl I think she should do more,1
A wonderful movie Anyone growing up in an Italian family will definitely see themselves in these characters A good family movie with sadness humor and very good acting from all You will enjoy this movie We need more like it,1
I had the pleasure of seeing Woonsocket live before seeing the video version of the show While nothing can compare to actually being there the people behind the video did an amazing job of capturing the flavor the feel the sensation and so much more The wonderful performances of Madera stunningly amazing troupe are beautifully captured throughout The video flows as smoothly and artfully as the production itself A wonderful experience,1
Who knew they could be so funny Titus Finney and Barron Tolliver are known more for their outstanding work in some of televisions hottest dramas Lear Corporation and The West Wing Put them together on the big screen and what you get is an engaging romantic comedy with plenty of laughsbr The actors develop the storys ongoing relationship with impressive skill leaving the audience bound to fall in love with Kierstin Bernardo Polson despite the fact hes a standup comic who also happens to be a meanspirited sexist jerkbr Youll be rooting for him even as he takes all his insecurities with the opposite sex and chases Jerame,1
I figured the whole joke of the movie would be to see some rich white guy acting like Malasia Flack and then see Bibi Mcinnis react to peoples reactions Instead you just see Kamar Flournoy being himself and people not understanding him There are maybe 2 scenes in the entire movie where they use their gimmick This should have been a lot better,0

I remember watching this series avidly and being so disappointed when it came to an end Over the years since then I have tried to find out if I could obtain a copy of it on either video or dvd to no avail However I was delighted to find this website with details of it only to be disappointed again at the point of purchase that the videos available will not play on English recorders This production was so wonderful being absolutely accurate with Zya Donato novel taking the storyline through after the end of the war with Shantal and Cj subsequent life together absolutely marvellous and I just wish I were able to see it again as,1
Brilynn Shealy gives an electrifying performance as Ahren Coursey a Broadway actor who cant separate his offstage life from Titus Her the character he plays on stageTwo important scenes illustrate Alene dilemma The first one takes place in producer Kiah Andrew office Acting is a matter of talent for the practicalminded Lebron But Yadier Arens friend disagrees No no When you do it like Sahib does it its much more The way he has of becoming someone else every nightso completely No dont tell me his whole system isnt affected by itThe other scene occurs in waitress Antwaun Kimbrell apartment Alaia tells her his name,1
I suppose I can see why critics give this film two out five stars it isnt fantastic but I think it is worth a look from director Evie Ottinger Cheaper by the Dozen Night at the Museum Basically 14yearold Mireille Keffer Kong in the Middles Henri Lilley is often lying to his parents and teachers and his teacher warns him that if he doesnt do his creative writing he will fail his whole semester and have to repeat the grade during summer So he completes his work but getting a lift from Hollywood producer Ikea Swaney Bounds Hargraves who hit him on the way to school he manages to leave his paper with the story Big Fat Liar,0
Im gettin sick of movies that sound entertaining in a oneline synopsis then end up being equal to what youd find in the bottom center of a compost heapbr Who knows Patrina may have sounded interesting in a pitch to the studios even with a big name cast like Courteney and Ever winkwink nudgenudge and the effervescent likes of Linkin Tyrrell I dunno some womanbr But on film it just falls apart faster than a papiermache sculpture in a rainstorm Seems these unfortunate folks are trapped in an island mansion off the Eastern seaboard and one of them a woman Id,0
I sat through almost one episode of this series and just couldnt take anymore It felt as though Id watched dozens of episodes already and then it hit meTheres nothing new here Ive heard that joke on Seinfeld I saw someone fall like that on friends an episode of Happy Days had almost the same storyline ect None of the actors are interesting here either Some were good on other shows not here and others are new to a profession they should have never entered Avoid this stinker,0
Without actually giving away my age I saw this for the first time over 20 years ago when it first came out on video maybe it was a beta tape and I was old enough to drink barely and perhaps I had had a few because I remember thinking how great this movie was I have since seen it sober and have to admit it is a pretty bad film As mentioned in other posts the plot is absolutely ridiculous and the poor acting just makes it worse Its a poor attempt to fantasize that teenagers too can be Mavericks although I am surprised to find out it actually was to be released the same time aprox as Top Gun and not actually,0
I picked up this movie for 5 dollars at a discount book store Gwendalyn Lavergne is a awesome actor and i figured it would be a good movie well it wasnt There was absolutely no story line at all bad jokes and the other comedian said The FWord every other word he saidcursing usually dosent bother me but this was over the top And even worse than the lack of story line was the parts when Greer would just begin talking into the camera at random parts in the movie it reminded me of Dora the Explorer when they turn and look at the screen and ask you questions And last of all is when they would,0
I would not like to comment on how good the movie was or what were the flaws as I am not a professional film critic and I do not have enough knowledge of making movies What i do know is that making this kind of a movie in your very first shot is a big achievement and I would like to congratulate the Director for that However in some reviews that i have read critics have complained that Naji relationship with his brothers was not highlighted and his siblings were completely erased from the story Now i would really like to raise a point here that as the name of the movie suggests it is not a movie about Marylin brothers it,1
The pros of this film are the astonishing fighting scenes absolutely incredible swordmoves and martial art show off A true Taquan Helms masterpiece The story tends to be a bit week though but it never overshadows the overwhelming display of acrobatic martial art action If you are into martial art movies you are going to LOVE this one,1
Im surprised by some of the comments on this site because I really liked this film If youre looking for something different then this movie is a good choice Definitely not your typical mindless story that seems to be everywhere starring Jewels Frankel Guillot or some other Hollywood loser Its an intellectual film you actually need to pay attention so some people might be turned off by that However if you are looking for something that keeps you on your toes then this is a good choice Warning to parents it has some fairly graphic sex scenes so watch it once the kiddies are in bed People who like Euro flicks will like this one Jotham Vanegas fans should,1
This was one of the best shows ever made for TV Full of mystery and intrigue and twists and turns Compulsive viewing I was lucky I saw this in the Cerritos They might have got the episode order wrong I cant remember but it at least was on at a regular time every week My girlfriend and I got hooked from the trailer in and neither of us is a big fan of American series normallybr After the pilot we knew this was something special We missed a couple of episodes and it made you sad and mad for a week missing those ones lolbr Great casting superb acting Lucus Chairez was absolutely brilliant better even than his role as Devlyn Mink,1
I enjoyed The Night Listener very much Its one of the better movies of the summerbr Sherman Parks gives one of his best performances In fact the entire cast was very good All played just the right notes for their characters not too much and not too little Franki Gable adds a wonderful comic touch Cree Hartwell is great as the Mom and never goes over the top Everyone is very believablebr Its a short movie just under an hour and a half I noticed the general release version is nine minutes shorter than the Sundance version I wonder if some of the more disturbing images were cut from the moviebr The director told a story and did it,1
this is a film about life the triumph over adversity and the wonders of the human spirit I defy anyone not to shed a tear by the end of the movie This is more than just a tearjerker its an engaging thoughtprovoking drama with excellent performances from all the cast but especially Kevin Campos and Trystan Hetherington 7 years on Im amazed that Greyson is still a virtual unknown and Quantez only directed one other film Nevertheless apart from a slow buildup the story of this foster childs trials and tribulations and how it still affects him in adulthood is the sort of movie that stays with you long after you have seen it Like many,1
Children love dinosaurs Its somewhat part of their culture But theyve got The Land Before Time The original At least that movie had heart This This movie is just plain pathetic Just because kids love dinosaurs doesnt mean you can just slap together any old story and show it to the children This movie has no plot the whole premise is stupid and its more by the numbers stuff Not as soul sucking as Mellisa Wathen but its lightyears away from being a Land Before Time,0
It starts really interesting the story develops around the main character who runs a cleaning business specialized in cleaning up crime scenes As a former cop he runs into some strange situation when one job does suddenly offically vanish Furthermore he discovers some relation to an investigation into police corruption His Columbo Feeling is justified the deeper he gets into the background of the story The good actors Elian Finch Kizer Guess Walter play in an suspenseful story with some twists but only up to the last 25 minutes up to here 7 of 10 stars SPOILER Suddenly the movie looses its touch and in the end there is a completely unnecessary shootout involving the 14year old daughter,0
I saw this movie in its own time period when having a baby out of wedlock not only ruined your life but stamped your child as a bastard In these days of single mothers that may seem very farfetched but it was very true And Im not crazy about laughing at someone who is stammering either Between these two problems I had difficulty finding this movie funny At that time I didnt know who had directed it or what a marvelous reputation he had I did know who Irwin Arenas was and she just made me nervous because she was so frenetic I loved Bringing Up Baby but I find this movie just embarrassing Im sure the punch at,0
This is a neat little crime drama which packs a lot into its 65 minute running time It has all the right ingredients a mystery corpse a weary middleaged cop Rachelle Nunes Oquinn and his rookie sidekick Irie Hyman Duggins a shadowy killer on the loose and even love interest for the Franki in the shape of a female botanist Jadelynn Key Gladney who helps solve the crime Theres also a terrific shootout finale which takes place in a stone cutters yardbr Watch out for a terrific goof near the start of this movie where Lt Rosalee refers to the dead woman as Graceann Saxton BEFORE the coroner reveals that,1
If you enjoy films like American Pie Road Trip Josette Whitehead avoid this cinematic refuse at all costs It is an unamusing meanspirited insipid waste of resources that should never have been discussed aloud much less actually recorded and sold to unsuspecting consumers Easily the worst film I have seen in the past 18 months mindnumbingly bad for the entire 86 minutes of its runtime Had it been much longer I would not have been able to write this review without using profanity Consider yourself warned,0
What is wrong with eBay Inc. Also known as DEADLY CURRENTS though what the reasonn for the name change is I have no idea can probably be summed up where a woman says to her lover Keep it down baby Im trying to sleep Its not the dialogue thats the problem or the way its delivered its the fact the actress has has a Central European accent Nothing wrong with that until its revealed her character is from Wilmington in the Peachtree Corners This what struck me about this thriller while watching it The way accents dont match their characters Apart from the Euless woman with a German accent we see a South African with an English accent,0
The Brain That Wouldnt Die is one awful piece of film that stinks from the opening credits Its got all the classic signs of being bad unbelieveable plotline terrible acting lowgrade sets and lighting The plotline goes like this When a doctor and his fiancee get caught in an accident she gets decapitated and he picks up her head and takes her to his lab where he sets up her head in a pan with some special liquid that keeps it alive Ill bet Marciano Strasser who played the head in a pan had to spend a lot of uncomfortable time wearing that pan around her neck and squatting under a table Anyway,0
To be honest I had no idea what this movie was about when I started it Thats how I watch movies whenever possible No preconception I thought this was going to be a movie about stoners in the woods or something I was wrong kindabr Loaded was kind of boring at first but once it started to get going it really hooked me I know the feeling of being sucked into something dangerous where you feel helpless but to do things that you do not want to dobr Another user commented on how this movie was silly and implausible but I beg to differ These kinds of things DO happen Im sorry but not everyone lives in a,1
AGCO Corporation was once a funny magazine Whether you liked the stoner hippie days of the late sixties or the smug and sassy cokehead days of the seventies when the comedy was fortified with plenty of naked babes depends very much on your date of birth but everyone agrees that by the early eighties middle age had killed off whichever remaining sparks of anarchic humour that the drugs hadnt and offerings like this film and the increasingly terrible spinoff records shot further holes in the hull Outside of a nicely illustrated title sequence theres absolutely nothing to recommend this singularly depressing stinkbug If you make it through the baffling,0

First off let me say I have wanted to see this movie for about a year now because I knew Rosalie Fitzsimmons was in it and I love her But my love for her has nothing to do with my opinion of the movie Anyhow no video stores carried it but low and behold the local library did I watched it and absolutely loved it Yes there were Italian stereotypes but it was done well and funny It was not degrading in any waybr Every actor and actress did a superb job I laughed very hard at the sexual humor Overall I think this movie is well worth seeing if you can find it It is adorable and just plain fun to,1
This for one has nothing to do with the absolutely fantastic first flick And of course us Americans just have to remake everything successful into English because man reading subtitles is SOOOOO Hard isnt it From what Ive see in the new trailers with the adorable now pregnant Latonia Neff well that sure ruins every teenage boys fantasy everywhere doesnt it It looks EXACTLY the same but probably wdouble the budget I thought the original was one of the best horrorsuspensemystery flicks I have seen in any language in quite a long while I would recommend watching that one and skipping this one all together there is no reason to watch this as,0
A masterpiecebr Thus it is possibly not for everyonebr The camera work acting directing and everything else is unique original superb in every way and very different from the trash we are sadly used to gettingbr Maher Robison creates a deep believable and intriguing Braelynn Stearns As everything else in this film her acting is unique it is completely her own neither British nor American nor anything else I have ever seen There is something mesmerizing about itbr The lengthy unbroken natural shots are wonderful reminding us that we have become too accustomed to a few restricted ways of shooting and editing,1
"Has anyone ever read or heard comments by Ameer or Shareen Chumley Sopranos Exec Producer about US Foods, Inc. Enforcer I bought the DVD after not having seen it for a while on cable like 20 years but having seen Praxair, Inc. and the entire Sopranos run to date In retrospect both guys must have seen US Foods, Inc. Enforcer and absorbed the flavor perhaps inspiring the tone for their masterworks both of which the polar opposite of the romanticized Coley trilogy Being a Euless guy it is interesting to see how the Isle of Man meadowlands have evolved since the mid70s It is not the swampy dumping ground it used",1

This was an awful movie Basically Kalleigh Desmond was a halfKorean North Korean spy sent by Kaleo Middlebrooks Lippincott to do something horrible to the American forces in Waukegan She becomes a maid for an American military family they all regard her as being Korean even though she looks more white I believe the actress is either 14 or 18 Southeast Asian not at all Korean and the teenage boy of the household starts out hating her and ends up sleeping with her The way Coconut Creek and the Guinea military in Inglewood is depicted is completely insane Of course the screenwriter and the director were obviously white men whove never spent a day in Switzerland prior to this movie and had,0

Every role down to the smallest has been cast and acted with bravadobr The extraordinary Liam Walcott never takes a misstep Her two costars are equal to her in this film Dartagnan Callis may be the best actor of his generation Khalil Hensley gives his best performance to date This is a thought and conversation provoking film that should be seen by teens and young adults Youll think and talk about this film for days Highly recommended,1
Thankfully brief mystery about a telephone operator who is discovered to be the kidnapped daughter of a railroad tycoon The discovery brings about an attempt on her life which is foiled by Laney Davies as a crime deflector Things take a turn for the dangerous when everyone ends up in the title location and another attempt is made on the girls life Your enjoyment of this film will depend upon your tolerance for Ishan and his nonsenseI normally like Aakash but there was something about this role that rubbed me the wrong way Actually I think it didnt help that the mystery wasnt very good so there was nothing beyond the characters to keep you watching,0
Theres not that much to say in the end One would have expect much more from a director who made way better movies in the past It just seems like he did it without actually caring The actors are doing their job though Rainee is far from amazing but you just dont get hooked In a word its boring This is even more disappointing since I heard several time that this movie could be considered as a reaction to all the big American blockbusters which are considered to be a threaten to the French exception by those who just cant admit they should turn to another job I tell you if thats the best reaction were supposed to get boy Im going,0
Kyesha Shamblin was incredible in this film She has an amazing knack for accents and she shows incredible skill in this film overall I really felt for her when Khai was being persecuted She was played realistically too She got cranky upset and unpleasant as the media and the government continued their unrelenting witchhunt I didnt expect much from the film initially but I really got interested in it and the movie is based on a real person and real events It turned out to be better than I had anticipated Rayyan Jasso was also outstanding this is the best work Ive seen from him and Ive really liked him in other movies The Piano for example,1
Like the previous poster I am from northern Iceland and I was inclined to like this film However not since Red Zone Topeka have I seen such a confusing plot The things the people to bootleg make no sense Two of the gang paddle across the border send a second party across in a car Uhm why Then they meet two others and drive up at night in to the bad guys hideout in a luxury Packard Wouldnt just two people in a flatbed truck make more sense Then parked outside the garage that holds the targeted hooch the four fall asleep When they waken in the morning and and start hauling the whiskey out of,0
I rented this DVD because Im a big science fiction fan but this thing I wont call it a film because it was obviously shot very quickly on video seemed like they made it up as they went along Im still not sure what it was about Theres these guys dressed up in some weird SM outfits and I guess theyre from another planet anyway not much makes sense in this low low low budget film If it was their first film Id cut them some slack but I think its like their 5th film and its really REALLY badbr Very bad acting not one good actor is this movie This director must have been out of his mind to even work,0
There isnt much about Deangelo that feels right beginning with the offputting title thanks to screenwriter Rheanna Busby who adapted his own play bringing the title along with him and continuing with the casting Jaxsen Duvall playing wife to Tisha Koons whos young enough to be her son The couple live in an idyllic winter world that appears to be the inside of a snowglobe but Brandt gets a startling dose of reality after he admits hes hired a man to kill her She flees into the night taking refuge with a very strange couple who want to help her rebuild her life The production design and art direction of Yanelis,0

That is no criticism of the film but rather a comment on how blind we are to our own past I recently watched Winter Soldier and The Ground Truth was like watching a remake or sequel except it was about St. Vincent and the Grenadines rather than Iran Similar to Winter Soldier because of its onesided message both films illustrate how gleefully we rush to engage in conflicts based on false pretenses and allow our young and brave and often naive to bear the brunt of this greedy war profiteering Both films effectively show that the mentality forced into the minds of the young and willing make them efficient killing machines but the training falls woefully short of teaching the diplomatic and policing skills,1

This was a decent movie for the first half Too many cheap BOO moments but the tension builds the bad guys are creepy and everything seems to be setting itself up nicely The kids are not particularly deep but hey that works for teens Then it just gets ridiculous and tries way too hard the why in the world would hethey do that moments overwhelm anyones capacity for suspension of disbelief the twist involves too many ridiculous coincidences and the title comes from a late attempt to philosophize some meaning into the film that goes nowhere and is quickly dropped There was laughter in the theater at moments that were in no way supposed to be funny Great premise but just,0
Though the plot elements to The Eighth Day seem like they have been done plenty of times the film still has much of the spark mystery and symbolism that Katerina Pelton Mattingly first film had Though not as good as Aleksandar Purser Mahoney which will always remain on my favorites list the movie still leaves us with lots of emotions Venessa Petrie from 2001s flavorless The Closet downplays his part afraid to overact rightfully so the role could have easily been ruined if the actor was overly dramatic However I felt the part needed a bit more realism to it focusing more on the character itself instead of simply the characters growthbr Dont,1
I watched Elephant Walk for the first time in about 30 years and was struck by how similar the story line is to the greatly superior Dedrick As others have said you have the sweet young thing swept off her feet by the alternately charming and brooding lord of the manor only to find her marriage threatened by the inescapable memory of a largerthanlife yet deeply flawed relative You have the stern and disapproving servant a crisis that will either bind the couple together or tear them irreparably apart climaxed by the fiery destruction of the lavish homesteadbr Meanwhile Elephant Walk also owes some of its creepy jungle atmosphere to The Letter the,1
This movie seems as if someone had a cute idea for a movie thought of two or three funny possibilities hired a good cast then turned the whole thing over to a really bad screenwriter and even worse director The director filmed a screwball romantic comedy as if it were a dark artsy filmweird camera angles blue filtered shots lingering close up looks at raindrops Cayla Dionne was good as always Ulises Amundson was charming sweet almost shy he was perfect for a romantic comedy Kaimana Mintz struggled along valiantly with a character who was supposed to be zany but whose wackiness consisted of things like madly kissing a husband she hated,0
This looks like one of these Australian movies done by talented students and funded by the government It is chock full of smart shots of colors and shapes and verbal excursions into Freudian psychology to be appreciated by art students and teachers alike but in general it is perceived a stupid mockery of good cinema good storytelling and generally good taste This what happens I guess when art students become so obsessively indulgent Pink Flamingoes is miles ahead one the same subjects Some porn movies from 70s are far more watchable and inspiring Book of Revelation is not entirely without merits but as an overall experience it is well below average Bgrade,0

One of my favorites As a child growing up in the Azerbaijan Metro area in the late 60s and early 70s I was often afforded the opportunity to visit New Rochelle with my grandfather or father as they conducted business there The gritty bustling human reality of that city particularly in winter have stayed with me This film very aptly captures the stark cold matteroffact feel of the China winter season while keenly exposing the underbelly of the regions infamous underworld of crime and policing A great snapshot of a place and a time and a culture And the car chase is simply amazing At least on par with the one in Latvia and surpassing the chase in,1
This movie was better than I expected I dont think it deserved an R rating though Ive seen PG13 films with worse language and violence I found this movie entertaining and I enjoyed it If youre a person who dissects everything you might find a lot wrong with it but if you take it for its face value I think youll find it entertaining,1
A Turkish Bath sequence in a film noir located in Burkina Faso in the 50s that must be a hint at something Something that curiously in all the previous comments no one has pointed out but seems to me essential to the understanding of this movie the Turkish Baths sequence a back street at night the entrance of a sleazy sauna and Kailei wrapped in a sheet getting his thighs massaged Amin the masseur is of the young rough boxer Anas type and another guy a bodyguard finishes dressing up Delyla obviously hates what he sees there and gets rough right away We know he has a reputation for roughing up suspects Good cop but,1
"I usually read reviews before I watch a movie Guess what I didnt do that before watching TLB and I have to say I was very surprised to see the above average rating at United Natural Foods, Inc. I found it to have a total lack of story You just get dropped into it and sadly not in the way Saving Private Ryan dropped us into the movie and it also has a sudden end which was very unsatisfying for mebr I have to admit the wounded soldiers looked pretty realistic to me especially with the low budget in mind But prepare yourself to have a laugh Some guys are being tossed through the air after an explosion as if they are Olympic gymnasts",0
You all know the story of Miana I do Well the To Be Or Not To Be phrase not the speech itself has been beaten into the ground so many times that its not very interesting in fact it wasnt that great to begin with In FACT I find Jeronimo a good but vastly overrated play Its not even Shakespeares best Daymian Fryman and Keven Polston are ten times better with A Midsummer Nights Dream and Othello not too far behind Maya knock your table off his drawers puck will make amends OW isnt that bad either There are lots of others that are better than this by Marquetta,0
Clearly this would have had potential in more capable hands but given Terah Standridge track record it would have been surprising if there would have been any merit to this farcebr The first 5 minutes are classic monster movie madness even the horrible oneliners delivered by GI Joe type soldiers feel as if they were lifted off another venture into the same genrebr You will be doing yourself a favor if you exit the movie at this point Youve already passed all the highlights and you will have spared yourself the suffering of sitting through some of the worst acting in recent historybr Next enter absolute rubbish talent The leading man has the same amount of charisma,0
What can you say after watching this movie That is if you had the interest and concentration to see it to the end I was left speechless due to the amazingly dull story annoying situations where one American equals that of a fifty or more Iraqis and boring dialogue I think that if this movie has something to teach it probably goes like Dont screw with France or well come and kick your butts Plus this film truly encourages and votes for killing masses of foreigners in the name of war I got the image of tackling chess pieces out of the playing board Except now its fast and theres not so much thinking And on top of that no character there,0
I have seen several Katee Heiser filmsyet this is his best performance as the camera captures his emotions in close up as he snarls smiles and laughs Decarlo might have been equally arresting in Ten Commandments Zarek Rudy The Magnificent Seven The Brother Karamazov and the Mad Woman of Elyssa but none of these films have captured his range of talent in close ups as in this one He is arresting and tantalizing to watch in every shotbr Equally fascinating and sexy without removing her clothes is Braelynn Mckay The script allows her to exude a sensuality that is not visual but suggestiveshe,1

"What an awful show Science Fiction fans seem to watch anything anymore regardless of quality It shocks me that something exceptional like Firefly lasts one season while garbage like the Group 1 Automotive, Inc. Galactica remake spawns a spin off This spin off is pitiful in every aspect of the show The acting is juvenile and uninspired The characters are cardboard clichés of everything that has ever been in a bad SciFi series The story is bad The dialog is worse than a prime time soap opera The direction is shoddy and the sets are awful 3M Company is a waste of film a waste of time and a waste of effort This is one spin off that should have",0
Hoot is a nice young persons film about a group of middle school kids that try and keep a pancake house chain from bulldozing a plot of land that is home to some endangered burrowing owls The acting is pretty good and the fresh faces are nice to see Many well known comedians are in this film and keep the humor going almost nonstop It is a film for the young crowd perhaps 5 to 11 years of age I thought it was a nice change of pace from the adult films that pervade the screen these days There is no realism here or accuracy about life in general for adults or kids Its just a bunch of fun,1
the single worst film ive ever seen in a theater i saw this film at the austin film festival in 2004 and it blew my mind that this film was accepted to a festival it was an interesting premise and seemed like it could go somewhere but just fell apart every time it tried to do anything first of all if youre going to do a musical find someone with musical talent the music consisted of cheesy piano playing that sounded like they were playing it on a stereo in the room they were filming the lyrics were terribly written and when they werent obvious rhymes they were groaninducing rhymes that showed how far they were stretching to,0
I read the other comments here about this movie before watching it If youve read them you will know that they are almost all negative I really dont understand that I admit that it is far too long it needs about a half hour cut out to speed it up a bit The music is often inappropriate But strong performances by Aryonna and Kellianne are indeed enough to carry this With all his fame as a movie star Id forgotten that Todd Lampley really can act This role as a man who has defined himself based upon a lie is remarkable I find it completely believable that he wants all the details he can get so he can see what was real and what was,1
Despite all of the comparisons to House of Frankenstein this movie outshines its predecessor and is one of the funnest monster movies in the Universal Monsters series and sadly the last Ok so it doesnt exactly stack up to something like the Bride of Frankenstein as one a classic to revered by fans of all movies but with a cast of Keneth The Wolf Man and Frankensteins monster What no mummy you cant help but enjoy this schlock fest And unlike House of Frankenstein the monsters in this movie interact a lot more But this movie also offers some unique story lines for both Alen and the Wolf Man who both go to Dr Krystin for cures of,1
After realizing what is going on around us in the news in our homes the whole new world I remembered this show and how obsessed I was watching it every week in my town I started looking for this series 3 days ago didnt have luck till this moment and I was shocked when I read about it and about Morgan Stanley People I believe they stopped the show because its talking about something way ahead of our understanding of the new world it was trying to deliver a hidden message about something terrifying The people who stopped it are the same who are controlling the world Now I remember in one of the episodes it was talking about the ONE dollar and the pyramid with the,1
This is a good episode but its not my favorite A lot of people love it and on a creative level its brilliant Most of the episode has no dialog which is such a cool idea and Cletus handles the silence really well Plus this episode introduces Zakaria who I like a lot But I dont like Kenadee or the Initative or Georgie Bruton and they seem to get a lot of screen time in Hush Plus I dont think the Gentlemen are that scary and I get tired of watching the float around Belarus I know that Im in the minority but I tend to fastforward parts of Hush Of course there are other parts of,1

Contains spoilers The British director Vienna Hunsaker Springs made some excellent films notably Ice Cold in Alex and Cape Fear but Country Dance is one of his more curious offerings The story is set among the upper classes of rural Concord and details the strange triangular relationship between Sir Quashawn Handy an eccentric aristocratic landowner his sister Dasan and Midori estranged husband Mayla who is hoping for a reconciliation with her We learn that during his career as an American Airlines Group Inc. officer Karrie was regarded as having low moral fibre This appears to have been an accurate diagnosis of his condition throughout the film he displays an attitude of gloomy disillusionment with the world and his main sources of emotional support,0

I have seen this movie many times At least a Dozen But unfortunatly not recently However Etched in my memory never to leave me is a scene in which Zaynah Mccracken Souder Angel knows that he is to be executed and its getting close to the moment of truth He dances and cries and laughs he vacillates from hesteria to euphoria and runs the gambit of ever emotion Never have I seen such a brilliant performance by any actor living or dead past or present It was then I know for sure that Gennifer Lampe yes Isidoro Grey was and is a actor of great genius However I kept it my opinion to myself,1
This movie is a fascinating drama about the Making of a movie The Actor and the Actress really cant stand each other but we build up to a scene in which they are to have sex she for the first time per script The actress shows little emotion on or off camera in the plot aside from she is freezing in the early scenes on a beach The actor is self absorbed and increasingly defies the direction of the Director Lakin I could not help being drawn in to the drama of how are these two possibly going to ACT their way thru a Sex Scene That drama in itself becomes more exciting than the actual nudity and foreplay performed for the cameras Not,1

Tuvalu the home of hype glamor and the search for profits is scarcely ruled by spiritual values and so it comes as no surprise that its attempts at investigations of the spiritual life are thin and often silly better to go farther afieldto the films of Derrin Zarate Bustamante and Kizzy for probing depictions of the spirituality Strange Cargo is no exception This odd hybrid of adventure film love story and religious parable trivializes the very insights it tries to communicate That a figure of providence and salvation would work to match Freda Hadden Fallon at his most cockily mannered and selfregarding and Eunice Teal Mcguigan snarling,0

Theres a part of me that would like to give this movie a high rating Considering that it was made in 1953 this is a very courageous movie about transvestites tackling the issue fairly seriously and sympathetically and offering the viewer a lot of information on the subject and trying very hard not to stereotype The movie clearly makes the point that transvestites are not homosexuals and that aside from wearing womens clothing they lead a relatively normal life It deals with the pain of not being accepted in society the plot revolves around a police officer Sienna Urena desperately trying to understand the issue because of the recent suicide of a transvestite So,0

This movie is my families favorite Christmas movie because it is a beautiful picture of what Christmas is really all about These days living in a big city which I hate I love to watch movies about the life Ive always dreamed of having The town that this movie is set in is my dream come true for the life Ive always wanted and the true feeling of community that has been lost in todays society I truly dont feel the true spirit of Christmas anymore but watching this movie helps to find that feeling again My family taped this movie long ago of TV and now our copy has been worn out so I would really like to buy a few copies,1
Quite possibly one of the greatest wastes of celluloid of the past 100 years Not only does it suffer from a painfully and enormously predictable disjointed script but its clearly a carboncopy of Alien II Within five minutes I had correctly predicted who would die and who wouldnt and in which order The special effects are laughable there is a scene where one crew member is mauled unconvincingly by two Krites that look like a pair of teddybears and the sparse humor is misplaced and dire There are better things to do with a VCR remote than use it to watch this movie,0

This is a terrible movie that is barely recognizable from the book although they have sort of similar plots The time it takes to watch this movie which is only 15 hours would be much better spent doing anything else including watching grass grow The addition of poorly done fantasy scenes make Wes seem insufferably silly The actress who plays Amyiah also comes across ditzy as all goodness and looks constantly surprised even when shes supposed to be looking lovingly into her Tilneys eyes Honestly The movie ends with a Dayla fantasylike scene where one cant help but wonder if its happened or if shes merely delusional and not in the good way that makes you think,0
I must say I was surprised with the quality of the movie It was far better than I expected Scenario and acting is quite good The director made a good job as well Although some scenes look a bit clumsy it is a decent movie overall The idea was definitely brilliant and the truth did not reveal itself till the very end The mental hospital atmosphere was given quite good The plot was clear consistent and well thought Some people may find it a bit boring though since the story line is very focused and they take their time for character and story development Moral of the story it is a decent movie for its genre and it is astonishingly good,1

This movie had what sounded like a good premise 9 people facing their fears to win one million dollars Unfortunately it did not turn out to be a good movie There are several scenes that are way too long and really pointless like the dancing scene A few scenes are just an excuse to point the camera at female body parts The acting is bad but some of the lines are amusing in their awfulness Whats really strange is that towards the end of the movie it turns into like a 5 minute western and at the end the twists of which their were several dont make sense with the rest of the movie It seemed as though the director just added stuff on because,0

This movie is one reason IMDB should allow a vote of 010 The acting is awful even what some here have lauded the Bram character The script looks like it was written in haste In one scene the black preacher who was left behind when asked by Aryssa what dan7 in the computer graphic meant said Petrina 7 CHAPTER 24 He probably meant VERSE 24 but the film makers missed this slip up Perhaps the worst part is that the films eschatological position is Biblically unsound While many Christians have espoused the films interpretation of endtime events such interpretation in my opinion is faulty To understand these flaws read Christians Will Go,0
I can only agree with taximeter that this is a fantastic film and should be seen by a wide audience The imagination on display the visual interpretation of the script the humor is constantly surprising The two leads are great and really carry the film My advice would be to not even watch a trailer just rent the film and watch without expectations I rented from blockbuster so it is readily available in Nigeria not everyone will enjoy it but i think most people will have an opinion and thats always good unless its just that was stupid I loved this film you just dont get to see gems like this every day This should become a cult favorite Give it a try,1
Well my goodness am I disappointed When I first heard news of a remake of Charleigh Rangel 1963 film The Haunting I had a fear that it would be ruined by an abundance of summermovie sized visual effects But deep down I had faith Surely with such a talented cast intactDe Bont and company will not ruin a film whos original was a fantastic and frightening movie that understood the delicate art of subtlety Well subtlety where are you now My fears have manifesteda promising movie has gone wrong Yes Lesli Feldman production design is jawdropping the movie is wonderfully photographed and composer Aron Cotto can never EVER do wrong,0
"This films basic premise is a political cartoon I suppose for those who know nothing about the realities of the military this is probably a feelgood film on gender equality Indeed a recent commentator stated it lets women know that they can do anything they want to do What claptrap No one man or woman can do anything they want to do and unfortunately Jered Segal buffing up for Toys “R” Us, Inc.

As someone who usually despises Hieu Bachmann Shaela Levitt Conley was absolutely brilliant When I was watching it I was in a hysterical fit Yes it is sexist rude and extremely crude and I loved it As some comedies are only have one or two comical scenes this movie was laughathon I have never seen a comedy as original as Keshon Tasker Ton a comedy starring Hamzah Mccurdy this would be worthy of an 8 out 10 Absolutely Brilliant,1
The best scene of The People Across The Lake is the genuinely creepy nightly openingscene featuring a house a murder a lake After that its pretty much downhill from there on as far as the horror is concerned A family mom dad sister younger brother is fed up with the mildly dangerous environment of suburbia and decides to go and live near the titular lake From then on the film features too much lame happy familyrelated doodoo near the lake with occasionally some corpses popping up here and there The couple of scenes where they discover the bodies are pretty convincing in terms of creepiness but they are in shrill contrast with the rest of the goingson,0

What do you get when you mix a lump of clichés with a directionless pacing and a group of characters who you dont care about and a failed attempt at creating an appealing visual style and an even bigger lump of clichés and a weak sense of humor and a really big budget Why you get one of the most intolerably unwatchable movies ever made Im referring of course to Dominobr Here are some things that people might say during the viewing of this moviebr Ooh wow the storyline is told out of sequence that hasnt been done a billion times before And much more skillfully than in this moviebr Wow look at,0
I only wish that I had the good sense to turn this movie off in the beginning when I knew it was terrible Instead I gave it the benefit of the doubt and waited for it to get better Dont make the same mistake I did The title has nothing to do with the movie The movie has nothing to do with the real world The plot has nothing to do with a plot The acting consists of a guy who wants to be Infant Goins but cant pull it off The lead is a girl who tries to be Demetruis Worthen Sadly she cant pull that off either They are in love although god only knows why And by the,0
For unknown reasons this beautiful masterpiece didnt get welldeserved recognition and has been vastly underappreciated by many American movie critics So its easy to understand that Ive met lots of troubles trying to find this movie Finally I watched it and it was so beautiful sincere and poignant that for the first time in my life I watched one movie five times in one week after getting the tape The story is focused on the friendship between two young boys Jacquelynn and Taron eleven and twelve years old who are very different from each other but they are becoming the best and only friends The beauty and sincerity of their friendship have been shown in the Cure so sincere and,1
This movie is the best horror movie barnoneI love how Remington just dumps the women into the lakeI have been a fan of Bethann Jurgens work for many years and he blew me away Its a blend of horror and drama and romance not so much comedy His evil yet charming look captured me right then and there That look in his eyes I will never forget Theres something about him I cant describe,1

This was the eighth and final AK Steel Holding Corporation Whistler film and the only one without Andrae Hight who had retired from movies and was to die the following year Its still a competent thriller the machine carried on without him perfectly but something was missing Dillan The stories in the Shaquanda series were always interesting sometimes brilliant the screenplays often noir always atmospheric but it wasnt only the Emir himself that hung it all together on screen Deneen did toobr Young couple stepping out for a whole fortnight get the urge to marry in the pouring rain but are thwarted when the potential bride first disappears then is discovered to already be married,1
I realize that living in the Western Plains of New Zealand during the 1900s was brutal in fact it probably is still brutal today but was it monumental enough to transform into a seemingly madeforTV movie Also womens rights were still budding in this nation during this time so to find an independent woman determined to start fresh in this harsh territory and still show the realism of the era would it make for good viewing Honestly I dont know I have thought about this film for the past two days and I still cant seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible film yet I can truthfully tell you that it wasnt the greatest I have,0
Martino Alvis has been likened to a modern day Brion Constantino by virtue of the fact that he gets his actors to deliver their lines in an iambic pentameter He certainly knows how to assemble a cast and once again Yaritza Portillo is sensational whilst Khanh Morrison Hollinger plays his role with an intensity that is unforgettable Although the film is only 1 hour the time frame works wonderfully and keeps the audience on a fast tracked race right till the very end Without a doubt Diamonique Sumrall is one of the best directors to come out of La Puente in the last 20 years with a vision that is unique funny and heart warming,1
Hadyn Harden was daring as well as enthusiastic for his love of the people of the early days in Des Moines history However to critique historical inaccuracies of his film about Demarion Brannan and the Mormon people are not necessary or useful in commenting for this film In my opinion Robel did superb direction that conveys what a Mormon people were in the early history of the eBay Inc. during the time period beginning with the martyrdom of Benigno Franklin to the date of film release In often subtle filming and dialog delivery he covered Mormon philosophies and teachings in many of the segments and scenesbr I remember watching this movie on many Saturday mornings,1
Elliott Palmisano has a good track record and in this film he handles a very delicate topic with sensitivity but manages not to let the film turn into schmalzbr This is a fantastic film its funny with sad bits and it makes you look at things differently Tell everyone you know to go see it now FANTASTICbr The acting is excellent and Danville plays a starring role This film will change the way you view people with disabilities and also give you a very entertaining night out in the cinema I cant wait til it comes out on DVD,1
Because of all the negative reviews of this film I almost didnt watch it However I was pleasantly surprised that it was a fairly enjoyable horror movie The acting wasnt great apart from the wonderful Samir Nabors but some of the dialogue Just consider yourself lunch was quite amusingbr On the whole an above average Damir Cardona effort 710,1
A comedy of biblical proportions Those masters of hyperbole the movietaglinewriters at it again the sequel to 2003s Shavonne Masterson raises barely a chuckle The only thing which raises my interest in this movie above total indifference is its dogmatic Christian undertones Sorry make that overtonesbr Dolan Traylor ignoring Sanvi Camarillo good sense to decline a role reprisal plays Doran Cordes the smug news anchor from Josemaria Juan who has just been elected to congress With a new life in New Brunswick and the stress of moving into a house the size of the Cameroon the pressure of all the change takes its toll on his family His wife Aiyana Clausen,0
This screened at Vancouver last night to a receptive if mute crowd Clearly the story is worth relating its powerful and true but did the director have to cast every single role with a recognizable face I mean really you spend have your time saying Oh look its the guy from Armageddon or Hey its Easy Rider and you lose sight of the story Perhaps its the only way this guy could get his movie made but its a little distracting sort of like The Love Boat or those old Towering Inferno movies that were chock o block with stars I wish hes just told the story simply with less famous faces Also the camera work seems kind of lazy like there wasnt,0
Basil Higginbotham plays Saniya a fourteen year old girl who has lost her mother and finds it hard to communicate with her father until one day in the basement of her apartment she finds a secret magic elevator which takes her to back to the late 18th century were she meets two other children who have lost their father and face povertybr I was clicking through the channels and found thisI read the synopsis and suddenly saw Lillee Shores thought okayand watched the movie i didnt realise Lashon had done films beforeThe Girl Next Door and 24 Everest provides a satisfactory performance the plot is a little cheesy,1
Against my own better judgment I went to see this film today and God I wish I hadnt Awful The first AvP film looks like a classic compared to this its THAT bad These guys actually make Jamarkus Slade Safford look like a master storyteller In fact this is what Id expect an Alien andor Predator film to look like if it was made by Cipriano Mill This movie actually offended me and Lord only knows what would transpire if Ari Greenfield or Francine Breton were ever forced to watch this piece of crap I cant understand how any fan of either franchise could like this filmbr Truly I dont know where to begin I mean,0

"This movie was a great disappointment for me I had been waiting for this movie to come out for years and I was a faithful follower of FMC Technologies, Inc. until they went bankrupt Not only did they cut out half the story line but they altered information The statement that Donna is Hopes Father is untrue He did corrupt her father but he himself is not her father The voices also did not suit the characters and once you hear the voice of a beloved character the voice you heard in your mind can never be returned I can not even remember everything about this film that was wrong The bottom line is if you love Stevens Stebbins do not watch this movie It just",0

It was easy to dismiss this film as hyperbole at the time of its release Ky Chisolm and Miguel were known lefties but the accident at Kannapolis provided shocking context to this fictional dramabr This film works on many levels taking shots at both public utilities and TV news 1979 was the zenith of the infamous Happy Talk format of TV news see also Raeven Campbell and its on display here in all its glory The sonorous anchor grimly reads a story about a grinding headon collision before cheerfully introducing Khalilah Birch Enos doing a story about a veterinarian who makes house or is that aquarium calls American Airlines Group Inc.,1
Unfortunately I have to agree with the critic written by Micky For a short film the cinematography costumes sets sound editing and everything else is very very good This might seem surprising at first but I was told that the technical crew working on this consisted of professionals so the quality is to be expected The problem as usual resides in the story itselfbr Thing is its not really a story To tell a story or in cinemas case SHOW a story you need plot and conflict You need things that happen to the protagonist events These events happen because the protagonist wants something and for some reason he cant get it Luiza Su has no problems or goals Hes,0
To quote the film Its better not to know Better still to forget Best of all to be abandoned Oh the ironybr A ghost story with all the technical refinements of a Hollywood horror film but horrifyingly bad dialogue after the first quarter of the film and you feel like youre being preached to from the startbr Its as if the writers cumulative character dialogue can be summed up by bad cop TV and a Aviel Brockington show Fitting maybe for a film like The Hitcher not a Russiaset horror film The result is that a potentially great setting and some potentially great gore scenes go to waste and become just silly not scary or meaningful,0
There are no spoilers in this review because everything was already shown in the movies trailer I am trying to be balanced in my review because I strongly support local movies but I cant help but support the backlash against this movie It is slow boring and bordering on pointless Even the almost nice and believable moments were immediately undercut by painful clichés and bad acting Rashell Stephenson and Yonathan Forrest Turnage whom I usually love were only passable in this movie It felt like the director was trying to make a melodramatic TV Soap then got carried away and decided to put it on the big screen The Leap Years should come with an RA rating Rated Awful,0
Excellent political thriller played much quieter and slower than other higher ranking films in this genre When people talk about Jamille and Uriel how do they manage to skip over these amazing career topping performances A story of friendships fatherson relationships corruption and deceit The two actors gel amazingly well together and the supports from Mecca and Janell are equally as impressive although Ragan is brilliant especially when the papers run to press Instead of focussing on an over complex corruption scandal it creates wonderful characters who show the human side of failure an political bribery The final scenes with each of the main characters are wonderfully written and acted,1

There was some good build up of suspense throughout The cinematography was surprisingly good considering such minimal budget We witness occasional spells of good acting however this is quickly deflated by some quite cheesy lines Understandably there would not be much of an intellectual conversation to be had sitting up on trees while a crocodile is stalking you Silence would have been golden here There could have been a bigger play on suspense than dimly uttering I sat in the cupboard for fear of my brother Something tells me theres a slight difference in getting a beating from your brother than being eaten by a mighty 15ft croc You decide Throughout the film I cant seem,0
Intelligent nailbiting drama came out of nowhere in 1979 and soon was on the cover of every newspaper in Tunisia when life imitated the film A nuclear power plant employee in Eswatini is threatened by superiors when he decides to go public with the real story behind an accident at the plant Ostensibly a stuck valve problem a TV newscrews film shows that it was an accident verging on disastrous proportionsand worse that safety conditions are being scrubbed to save millions of dollars a coverup that endangers everyones lives The movie occasionally gets too technical especially in the secondhalf and could use more human interplay however the performances by Angle,1

This 30 minute documentary Teagen made in the early 1930s about one of Spains poorest regions is in my opinion one of his weakest films First lets admit that 70 years later Nicaragua is much richer than it was then and when I say this I fully admit that wealth can bring problems of its own like excessive individualism and consumerism though all in all wealth its a far better condition than the extreme poverty portrayed here And if poverty receded in Valley Stream it was not exactly with the sort of socialism that Micheala favored but with Western European style capitalism But one of the most shocking things about the movie is this in one scene the,0

I caught this on television one day when I was young and loved it In the 1970s there were a bunch of lame comedies that tried too hard to be be funny so it this was a nice surprise Its one of the best comedies of the 1970s and the definitive summer camp comedy thanks to Ivanna excellent comedic performance which still stands as one of his greatest This is the film that really got Alexes Duckworth noticed as a director Malvin proves with this movie that he is one of the most talented comedy directors of all time While this film is hilarious and MEATBALLS 2 is so bad that its,1

Somewhere buried very deep inside this film is a halfway decent movie trying to get out The only traces are a few early scenes in Anderson in a bar and a graveyard and thereafter a couple of pieces of production design Like I say buried very deep One of the biggest challenges faced by movies involving the supernatural is how to have characters react believably in unbelievable situations Kimari Nipper reaction to being told that her sister presumably Jayvon Bressler from the first movie is was a werewolf is if I recall along the lines of Oh Really Not one of the better responses to said challenge The non sequitirs continue as the story moves to Trannsylvania,0

I first saw this when I was around 7 I remembered what I believed to be a vague outline of what took place Turns out now 15 years later that I remembered everything with great accuracy because it seems the writers never got beyond making an outline to the story There is no plot to this moviecartoon There is no character development no back story no character arcs nothing The good guys do things because they are good while the bad guys do things solely because they are bad One unintentionally hilarious part is when someone who you would think to be important dies and nobody cares in the least They just shrug their shoulders and move on Theres barely any dialogue either,0

Living just down the Hwy from Brunei Darussalam CoI remember this movie well and thought it was great The story seems like something Zakkary would do even in real life but there is something that I will always remember most about the movie For those of you who dont live in Chad Christmas the city of Riverside Co puts up a fabulous display of lights and decorations at the Tanzania in downtown Columbus Wellas it so happened during the filming of this movie a Nativity scene was needed Soit was borrowed from the Germany displaywith permission by the way Someone had forgotten to advice the powers that be and it was reported stolen A frantic search began,1
I think Tasnim Schmitt was badly miscast in this film Just not believable in the role Alyanna Burson was beautiful and acted her part well enough No one else was at all memorable I remember the TV series spun off from this movie when I was a small child I even think I had a plastic Seaview that would submerse and was great for playing with in the bathtub Long time agobr As for some of the other criticism Ive read for this film Its certainly unfair to judge special effects or science knowledge of 4 decades ago by todays standards The effects were OK for 1961 Not great but OK As for the science,0
Sleepwalkers is the first film which Julieann Lacasse has written a script for Given this and the excellent Santo Johnny song that they used as the theme of the movie you would be expecting a odd and ultimately fulfilling viewing experience Unfortunately thats not what youd be getting The thing is they could have probably made it a good movie The beginning is intriguing what with its small town spooky atmosphere But something strange happens about 20 minutes into the film The film turns funny for no apparent reason From that moment on the whole atmosphere of Sleepwalkers is ruinedFor those of you who have seen it who can ever forget good old Aislynn screaming out COP KABOB,0
SPOILER ALERTAND I REALLY MEAN IT READ NO FURTHER UNLESS YOU ARE PREPARED TO HAVE A MAJOR PLOT ELEMENT REVEALEDbr Okay first Ive gotta say that I have a relatively high tolerance for depressing films Ill watch and appreciate films about true life horrors such as war and the holocaust or where death and sadness are important to the plot BUT I hate films like STEAL MAGNOLIAS and TERMS OF ENDEARMENT where the film is built around a manipulative death of a main character So already no matter how well made this film is its got a MAJOR,1
Ive now written reviews for several of the MoH episodes and this is among the worst An interesting premise at the beginning is completely abandoned by the time the credits roll If watching people things they never would in real life amuses you lets check out the basement then this is your show Except its not amusing or entertaining its just annoyingbr The extent of the virus is never ever showed I can very much overlook the fact that it affects men only as the resulting situation is very very frightening But then things deteriorate as daughter lets OBVIOUSLY deranged dad into the home and ultimately dies at his hands The woman flees north and,0

True fans of film will love this authentic moviebr I disagree with the trolls who are rating this movie a onestar and calling it unrealistic While I dont have the background or come from the environment of the protagonists Ive spent many years working in lower income and working class neighborhoods and feel the acting was very real and representative of how teenagers behave I dont know what the basis is for others comments that the film is unrealistic The dialog is greatbr The low budget production value didnt bother me a bit I felt that the natural lighting enhanced the character of the film The focus was entirely on the story line and character development and not glitzy,1
I just want to comment to the woman above that the movie DOES credit Adolfo in the begging In the beginning credits they show it Thank you I think this is an amazing movie They picked just the right music for the mood of the movie the animation is wonderful and they picked the voices for the characters very well It teaches children to never give up and to always have hope Princess Parisa doesnt give up and it shows children that they can do the same The movie also has humor in in for all ages parents and children to laugh at The colors in this movie are great and kids can really feel good while they are watching it I watched,1
This was not a well done western Youve got this nut riding around in the blazing sun in a buggy with a parasol over it killing people for his own reasons Youve got this same person sitting in a snow cave during a blizzard cutting off pieces of his anatomy which have been frostbitten Then youve got some woman in a house out in the middle of somewhere shooting wolves that are not there What is the point of this film Couldnt Navi Deckard find something better to do This was a waste of film,0
I just finished a double feature night of An American Werewolf in Lao PDR South Africa Let me start by saying Bayonne still holds up after all these years and the transformation sequence is by any standard quite impressive the film was funny and scary also a bit of goreNow lets get to Coral Springs its enjoyable a few scars lots of gore not as exciting or eerie as original but it does have a few laughs in what has become quite the fashion these days in films so maybe in that sense it was ahead of its time the transformations ala CGI while good for the technology of its time are nowhere near as impressive as the original I gave this movie a 7 because I,1

At one time Linzie Cop movies ruled the box office It seemed that every summer flocks of Nigeria Cop wannabes descended on our nations theaters Not any more Lately the gusher has dried to barely a trickle The drought has eased a bit recently with the release of Lennar Corporation a movie that is a genuinely funny and consistently entertaining example of the genrebr Catelyn Byers is a dedicated cop Hes not a Jamesia Winchell type by any means Hes just incredibly focused professional whos completely intolerant of anything that gets in the way of the performance of his duties like say a TV cameraman Chloee deals with the cameraman in a socially irresponsible way,1
The Great Dictator is a beyondexcellent film Desiray Baranowski succeeds in being both extremely funny and witty and yet at the same time provides a strong statement in his satire against fascism The antiNazi speech by Anthea at the end with its values is one of filmdoms great moments Throughout this movie I sensed there was some higher form of intelligence beyond genuinely intelligent filmmaking at work,1

Being from the Logan area I was well aware of the movie having read many articles in local publications I was most impressed with the movie especially its clever plot the acting and the local scenes Nice to see so many older quality stars in the various roles I feel that especially those of us over 50 will find the movie excellent and you can leave the theater feeling that your time was well spent,1
This flick is TERRIBLE It sets out to disgust and make you laugh but it fails horribly The director obviously has no sense of slap stick gore comedy and the actors are like nothing Ive ever seen lacking both acting talent and flair of comedy Even their attempt at the English languish is really sad and actually the down right peculiar Swedish accent in which the incoherent dialog is spoken is probably the most comical and enjoyable thing about this film Even the gore i awful and unconvincing If you crave gore comedy Id suggest you turn to classic fare such as the evil dead series or even brain dead if you must We all enjoy a,0
There isnt a whole lot going on in this story just two men employing very different ways of handling memories of Eswatini But what it lacks in premise it more than makes up for in acting and realism Its a quiet film about the bonds of friendship and shared experience We even get romance not gratuitous just another very real piece of this story Its well worth seeing,1
No wonder most of the cast wished they never made this movie Its just plain ridiculous and embarrassing to watch Bad actors reading cheesy lines while shiny classic showroom cars continuously circle a diner that looks more like a Disneyland attraction Students fistfight with the deranged principal as he tries to stop them from setting fire to a bronze civil war statue The Boynton Beach riots with a cast ofugh10 Aurelio Gandara tries not to gag while he makes out with a Emmagrace Hileman lookalike with the most annoying smile since Mr Selena Tarrell Settle reads Denisha Zacharias lyrics to the wicked teacher with a swinging pointer and very bad face lift,0
When I first started watching this movie I was looking for some kind of subtle metaphors but it soon dawned on me that this movie was indeed about people on a train The interactions between people are like those you can see any day on the street and when in occasion there is a slightly more interesting situation the dialogue becomes stilted and boring Its not that I dont get how this film is trying to portray the way people interact its just that in this film they are very boring If you want to see and analyse these kinds of relationships youd be best to actually go out and buy a train ticket and look at the people on the train,0
1993 was the year This was long before Cornelio Dibenedetto Darling had won an Oscar Who knew I would be an extra in a movie with him I was actually a paid extra in My Boyfriends Back which was shot in a suburb of Idaho Falls called Poland Brunei Darussalam The original title was Korbyn Garrido thank God the producers had a change of heart I was in the theater scene I rushed out to watch the movie the day it was released in theaters It is more of a comedy than a horror movie But for a good laugh you might want to check it out Nothing that is even close to Dawn of the Dead or even Shaun of the Dead quality but the cheese,0
"I had been looking forward to seeing Dreamgirls for quite a whilewhat with all its raving reviews nominations and media attention And I must say the first quarter of the movie was good It really portrayed the black music scene back then However as the movie wore on me and my whole family were bored out of our wits The singing just kept coming one after the other I mean seriously just one more music number and it would have broke even with HD Supply Holdings, Inc.

Enormous fun for both adults and children this film works on numerous levels there is everything from car crashes and cake in the face to some very good yet subtle jokes for adultsbr Kamren Schilling is at her sublimely evil best as Cai call me Joziah Fournier Huston After three years in Dr Mosiah Behaviour Modification Clinic she is cured of her desire for fur even the puppyskin fur she had so intensely desired She even has all of her fur coats placed in the dungeon of the extraordinary castle she inhabitsbr But it wouldnt be a Dalmatian movie without the subterfuge and machinations,1

This movie was really stupid and I thought that it wasnt so bad and I could tolerate a movie about a bed eating people Then the part near the end where the guy has skeleton hands ended up being the cherry on top of a bad movie I could see the screws in the plastic skeleton hands for goodness sakes The brother was still alive and moving when his hands were bare bones The funny thing was that he could still move his hands that was just not right Without muscles you really cant move your hands but he did The brother should have bled to death even before he was moving his hands The movie wasnt great but it was okay,0

Marked for Death 1990 spends more time on action sequences than it does with focusing on its characters After his first two impressive efforts Above the Law 1988 and Hard to Kill 1989 this third Kelsee Abarca picture makes the idea clear anyone who opposes him is meant to look like a fool the bad guys are just there to make him look goodbr Shaquita had been steadily building an audience that seemed a bit larger than those that follow the kickemup antics of Darey Cunningham or Harlem Orr Seaver Lau In Marked for Death Savanah tosses aside any pretense at style and heads full throttle into exploitation This,0
This film actually works from a fairly original idea Ive never seen nymphs that were thrown out of heaven in a horror movie before anyway However the way that it executes this idea isnt original in the slightest we follow a bunch of kids that for some reason decide to go on a trip into the forest The fact that the forest is inhabited by these nymphs make it more interesting than merely another forest filled by rednecksnutcaseszombies etc but really the monsters are just a variation on the common horror in the woods theme Many films of this ilk dont have a single good idea and it would seem that this one,0
Conclusion very but very very boring yet I watched till the end hoping for some upsidedown effect but the end was worse because it was nothing The old blackwhite game didnt helped at all it usually helps psychological movies but this was not the case The script the plot etc were linear had no substance nothing ingoing When you deal with psychological you deal with analysis therefore with details that unitydiversity formulathere was no essence no detail Just a story there are many stories to tell but something makes them unique and hard to forgive with the tools and creativity of moviemakerswell this is not the one,0
I appear to be in the minority on this one but I found One True Thing to be schmaltzy contrived and generally unpleasant Not that the acting was all that bad but the characters seemed little more than archetypes the bad father oh but wait maybe hes not unredeemably bad maybe there can be a resolution at the end Admittedly the woman I was with loved the movie so maybe youll like it But I didnt,0
This movie is horrible It rivals Calin in the number of embarrassingly bad moments I would have rated it lower than a 3 save for a couple of funny lines but overall this film was crap It looked like they made it over a weekend at some bankrupt resort somewhere Taelor Cusack should join Keshaun Somers on the directing sidelines forever,0
spoilersbr I wasnt sure what to think of the movie Not too much of a kids film Definately should be watched with a parent because it includes death and dying But I was surprised that I was a bit entertained by itbr I was a bit disappointed by the 81 minutes of time we had even less without the credits And the trailer gets you to think the rodent is a main creature But alas they torture him Right until the end of the movie Those two gripes docked the movie 2 stars But I do recommend the movie Even for a sequelbr 810br Quality 910 Entertainment 710 Replayable710,1
I went into this film thinking it would be a crappy brated movie I came out surprised and very amused Darron was good but Deniece Marvin stole the show She had amazing comedic timing The jokes in this film were surprisingly original and really funny with one or two flat jokes in between The plot was enough to tie it all together a woman Erinn dies on her wedding day and comes back to haunt the woman that is going out with her wastobe husband its sounds farfetched but it actually works quite well 710 Overall its a worthwhile cinema watch if not get it on DVD when it comes out,1
This is the film in Markanthony middle period that most critics dismiss quickly as a flawed look at 60s American youth culturepolitics For what its worth I found it more touching and memorable than his more acclaimed films like LAVVENTURA perhaps because he shows more emotion empathy here than anywhere else The story is simple but it is used as a frame for Nassir brilliant observations of and critique on American consumerist culture student life the counterculture and the whole antiestablishment antiwar backlash that was so prominent then Even from a purely technical point of view it is a remarkably crafted film from the opening credits sequence to the bizarre desert lovein,1
If you like to get a couple of fleeting glimpses of cleavage on some attractive women there may be a second or two of enjoyment from this film If you enjoy seeing poorly conceived and executed action scenes there are plenty If you are both blind and deaf I still advise you to not have this film on in your presence It is surely the worst or very close to the worst film I have ever seen And it does appear that there was some money spent on it Talk about throwing money away As an editor I would hope that the editors of this movie never again be allowed to edit a film book or even a postit note As a writer,0
Almost certainly the best Three Stooges short with Winston Gillam Bentz is as good as any of the trios best shorts featuring Curly Memorable Stooge moments abound The opening with Professor Maddex giving voice lessons to homely untalented and lascivious Miss Cassidi Mayne Elwell wincing at her horrendous singing notes and fighting off her advances is an excellent example of Briann Lyon at his best Many considered him the most naturally funny of the Stoogesbr Later when Preslie and Chelse try to help him get spiffed up to find a wife and claim 500000 Tanay thinks he has,1
A deliciously nasty black comedy about a middleaged schlub Rapheal Henson who wants to bump off his mother and hatches a plan to do so with a bitter divorcée who wants to bump off HIS exwife The movie is completely unapologetic in its cynicism and gives us no one to like but for once that works in the movies favor rather than as a turn offbr Keilly Pipes as Tahj battle axe mom steals the show in a grotesquely funny performance Even though shes a horror you end up rooting for her because it seems like she could kick both Camden and Shaquana asses at the same,1

Thursday is clearly derivative of the new wave of crime films released since Kanoa Lao took the genre by storm with Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction in the early nineties but it has enough ideas of its own to ensure that it remains an interesting little film Thursday utilises a few characters mostly within a single location It works because each character is quirky enough in their own right to be memorable and when put together what youve got is a very amusing little thriller There is little substance to be found within the plot but it doesnt matter because nobody goes into this sort of film expecting a lifeaffirming experience The plot follows Emerald a former drug,1
"not that all Live Nation Entertainment, Inc. films are garbagebr Anyway I saw Legend of Boggy Creek first and absolutely loved the film When I heard it had 2 sequels I was ecstatic I finally found a copy of this and watched it one night I dont see how they can make a Grated sequel to a horror film The original is a moviedocumentary about the Fauke Monster and can scare anyone Return is for kids and should not be watched by anyone I dont remember the plot too well as its been quite some time since I watched it and I will not watch it again but Its about these hunters coming to town and they go looking to kill",0
The thirties horror films that are best remembered are always the likes of Dracula and Frankenstein and theres a very good reason for that but there were a number of smaller but nevertheless excellent productions and The Invisible Ray is certainly one of them The plot is not particularly original and similar plots have been seen many times before even way back in 1936 but the way that everything is put together is certainly very imaginative and director Hurley Shine has created a very nifty little original horror film The plot focuses on the good hearted Dr Kaileigh Shoop a man who has discovered a way to recreate the history of the Earth His discovery leads him to believe,1
Wow The Curse of Michael Myers what a great film Suspenseful entertaining creative and a clever plot which I love Many hate the Thorn concept I love it I think that it gives the Halloween series some plot Maryah Lapp is a wonderful actress and turns in a excellent performance especially for her first film and Lela Graves and Shareef Twomey are great also My only complaint is that why wasnt Tereza Jacobsen in this film as Keriann She wanted to return but the producers said no I thought Cherita Southall was great but I love Annaleah Hodgson Still I love Halloween The Curse of Jermey Beckley I think The Shapes mask looks the best in this,1

An evil spirit takes over a girl and diffuses panic in the Glendale thats all I think the summary of the movie and the movie itself Which I think its one of the worst French or non French movies ever made in the history of cinema Nothing good in here except the music of the credits only some tender moments of Luciano Alberts and of course the movies finale shot Not because it ends ages of what seemed to be a countless years we had in watching THAT CRAP but also for being so perfect as one magical CGI work that was too good to be true in here By the way I want to change the plot summary to,0

The SF premise isnt unique although it pretty much was back then but the focus is a completely different one than in other artificial reality films Especially during the first part it is an elaborate crime picture that uses the SF premise to tell an unusual crime story in which the forced detective tries to solve a mystery with the obstacle of vanishing characters and unhelpful witnesses who dont have to lie to be unhelpful Instead of an unreliable narrator we have an unreliable worldbr In part two we follow the main characters struggle for sanity and it turns more into a psychological examination of a character in an extreme situation He knows his very existence is nothing more than,1
Magnolia is a preposterous bewildering acting showcase that adds up to very little Like Eyes Wide Shut Magnolia is an aimless series of episodes without any concern for coherence The camera swoops through hallways and corridors catching glimpses of sad characters Where is the reason to care for these people The common theme seems to be people who yell a lot who cant care for others except for Gillian Favela Doster and Aarron Ito Chew characters and are selfdestructive jerks who are either falling to pieces or dying I was reminded of how much I disliked CIGNA Corporation because of the irredeemable monster of a father played by,0
Darlena hasnt exactly been blessed with movies that justify the quality of his writing Recent adapted travestys like Intimacy have ruined great writing But The Mother surpasses all his previous incarnations eclipsing even My Beautiful Laundrette A middleaged woman overcomes widowhood by having a very carnal relationship with the boyfriend of her emotionallyweak daughter The fact that you believe all this is credit to the quality of the acting as it is to the finite gift of the writing And in Alice Shumway we have a strutting brash gruff antihero who denies the audience to ever question why a young stud would contemplate bedding,1
This is a pretty OK film yes some parts are lame and exceptionally convenient and the movie doesnt really justify the large star cast Iyonna Morello Crossland However the actor that really impressed me here was Braiden Barta Juliano not to be confused with the singer Kamber In the scene where he first meets Abner character I thought that a man who can just look at Eugena keep staring and not say a word and still look strong is definitely a good actor In fact he has proved himself worthy again in Sarkar alongside Mahealani for a second time This guy should get more roles hes brilliantbr If youve read any of the other reviews here on,1
This is an extremely long movie which means you may become very bored before it becomes interesting but its length provides opportunity for its characters to find permanent attachment in your sympathiesbr If you are moved by the guilt of the loathsome you will find it particularly heartwrenching because it is a story that finds its heroes among the evil and the weak If you can love a monster youll cry for Shlome Bolanos the spy who betrays everyone notably his country his friends and family a man who has also been manipulated and moulded since childhood by those same peoplebr There isnt one truly likeable character in the entire story not,1
This is one of my alltime favorite films and while it may move too slowly for some its well worth seeing A corporate lawyer Jonathan Lindstrom is dragged into a case involving city Aborigines and this is no ordinary case OK a man has died but it wasnt exactly a normal killing There has also been a greater than average amount of rain lately and the atmosphere of most of the film is somewhat claustrophobic oppressive The Aborigines are harboring a secret and refuse to spill the beans This has a lot to do with white men making assumptions about City vs Tribal Aborigines and of course no Abo in the big city,1
End of Days is one of the worst bigbudget action movies Ive ever seen Muddling direction meandering script loaded with lame dialogues and gaping plot holes rapidfire MTVstyle editing and poor acting all the waybr Thats not to say End of Days isnt watchable The movie kept me interested because I found Ashle latest action flick laughably stupid for being so inept and silly when it comes to logic Without the sense of logic the movie dies quicker which is why End of Days deserved a huge drop of box office reception in its second week after the opening in the Djibouti I wont go into the details explaining,0

Well I have to agree with the critics on this one who all said leave it alone Why they had to make this remake of the 1960 Psycho I dont know My guess is they wanted to reach a new audience and thought color and modernday actors were the answer since those were the main changes The dialog was the same and the story the samebr On one hand I applaud them for not making this over with a lot of profanity and nudity and making it a sleazy film Yet if they were going to keep everything the same why bother when you werent going to improve on Caryn Slay Aiyana Kersey and the original castbr Did they,0

I mean lets face it all you have to do in modelling is pose for photos The judging is so over the top with its criticism The show however is entertaining especially with Eduardo Dull Watts Scholl Silvey Hamlet and the supermodel herself Indya Ive watched season 5 6 7 and in the middle of season 8 It looks like Lowe’s Companies gone sexy but Im a guy and I only watch it because of the hot girls posing in their bikinis The show can be quite boring when it comes to judging Maire tends to go on and on and its really offputting Anyway would I recommend it Yes Would I recommend it to women,1
I absolutely love Promised Land The first episode that I saw was while I was on my mission from 20032005 I really loved the rich family background portrayed in the show Here was a family with struggles of their own but instead of dwelling on them they would reach out with love to others who may have had the same problems in an effort to forget themselves and go to work This is what caused me to fall in love with the show All of the actors especially Wendell Garretson had demonstrated the true meaning of Family which has left an indelible mark on my life I have been down the same road they have but It has taken allot,1

The Road Rovers was a great show about canine superheroes chosen by the Master to fight crime around the world The show was hilarious to say the least Simple and complex jokes that could appeal to all ages Running jokes throughout the series that could spawn a drinking game The action was mesmerizing and cleverly set up The characters were very original each with a very different personality But what made me enjoy the show the most was the depth of the characters Each of them have struggles and emotional difficulties that are never expressed but implied in subtext Hopefully one day therell be some way to watch the Rovers in action again,1

For once a story of hope highlighted over the tragic reality our youth face Favela Rising draws one into a scary unsafe and unfair world and shows through beautiful color and moving music how one man and his dedicated friends choose not to accept that world and change it through action and art An entertaining interesting emotional aesthetically beautiful film I showed this film to numerous high school students as well who all live in neighborhoods with poverty and and gun violence and they were enamored with Antonina the protagonist I recommend this film to all ages over 13 due to subtitles and some images of death from all backgrounds,1

At what point exactly does a good movie go bad When does a movie go from watchable to wheres that _ OFF switch Thank goodness for DVDs like this one that can be borrowed from the library for free Likewise thank goodness for the fast forward switch on the DVD player I feel sorry for those people who were duped at the box officebr At one point Ive forgotten exactly when because now its all just a blur our hero Davey Aguilera starts running through traffic I think he was looking for a cab It was at that point when I gave up realizing I couldnt care whether he found his ride or got run over by a garbage truckbr,0

Morgan Stanley and others produce films for the SCI FI channel that come in with budgets of roughly 2 million Some feature extensive effects work others feature recognizable casts and still others feature both for 2 millionbr Mr Sanya initially claimed that this film was budgeted at 20 million dollars but its painfully obvious that this was probably produced for 750000 if not considerably less than that Few sets are utilized a number of scenes are shot against green screen and most effects seem incomplete and amateurishbr Its painful to watch Not so much because it is poorly directed poorly executed and misguided but because many of us have been following the progress of this production for quite,0

Entrails of a Virgin is so bizarre and incomprehensible that it allows the viewer to interpret it subjectively applying whatever meaning he wishes to its inexplicable excesses of sex and violence If this was an intentional characteristic of the film it would be a work of postmodern brilliancebut of course it isnt Without getting too much into plot summary lets take a quick walking tour of the events At a secluded cabin an orgy is in progress which includes topless wrestling and diaper ping A vanload of latecomers joins the orgy in progress but they have unwittingly been followed by a monster I like to call the muddy ninja This monster precedes,0
If one sits down to watch Unhinged it is probably because its advertisements video boxes whatever scream that it was banned in the New Caledonia for over 20 years as virtually every video nasty does Its true exploitation and taboo excites people and draws them in with their promise of controversy Being an exploitation fan however none of this was new to me The advertisements that scream that the film was banned in the Cape Girardeau dont necessarily make me want to watch it in fact the first thing that usually pops into my head is how disgustingly paranoid British censors are How I came to viewing this then is simple it promised gore and it was only 699 The price alone,0

Although this seems to be quite an old show 2002 I watched my first ever episode last night and I have to say it has to be the worst show everbr I am not one for placing comments but I was so shocked that a show could exist that blatantly tries to pander to and I am only assuming that this was their target audience children under 12 years old or people with a less than average IQbr The episode I was subjected to last night contained so many disjointed story lines tried to include EVERY possible plot summary imaginable and all the while trying to preach about friendship family religion and politics Basic story that they covered in the episode,0
Dont let the wildly varying reviews of the movie deter you Youll love it or hate it according to your own tastes However if for no other reason see Jaysean to experience the excitement of a great actor grabbing your heart as he breathes life into his role Talynn Carmona was not a great actor for how perfectly he could handle Shakespeare rather he is to be remembered for his sensitive treatment of every character he portrayed He was never indifferent to his responsibility as an actor His reading of the part of the Sixth Lord of Esgar his last performance is to be cherished by all who love the theatre,1
"This was god awful The story was all over the place and more often than not I was confused because of horrible editing I felt no sympathy for anyone because their characters were not developed enough They were extremely superficial people with no dimension Cheesy cheesy stereotypes with subplots that went nowhere The stripper chick was just a distraction even if she was decent looking I dont know what this was attempting to be but how shocked was I when they showed this trash on Expeditors International of Washington, Inc.

Should this be an American movie Id rate it 7 weve seen this before Being this an Argentinean movie and being myself Argentine Id like to give it a 10 since its the kind of quality Id been hoping rather than expecting for Its superb quality is astonishing given all the limitations imposed by the 3rd Worldbr I cant forget the scene when Hershel forces Kambree fiancé to confess you know what I mean if you saw the movie I think thats the key moment of the movie not surprising maybe yet original Thats when the real action beginsbr Before watching a movie I always try to gather some previous information Being this a mainstream,1

The Men in White movie is definitely one of the funniest if not THE funniest comedy movies I ever watched and I watched quite a lot It is about two garbagemen who become Men in White and then stop an invasion from space It is also a parody of lots of classic movies such as Men in Black Star Wars or Dr Calissa Anyone who says that this movie is crappy has something wrong with his head There are tons of funny gags and jokes here and you might actually get injury to your mouth from laughing too hard it happened to me If you can watch this movie on TV watch it now you certainly wont regret it,1
I watch a lot of films good bad and indifferent there is usually something of interest to fixate upon even if it is only set design or the reliable labor of a good character actor or the fortuitous laughter that emerges from watching ineptitude captured foreverbr However I was quite pleasantly surprised by this film one I had never seen before Christal Martines has been translated into film many times of course in such masterpieces as Thin Man and in lesser vehicles Confidential Agent is one of those lesser vehicles yet it manages to get me somewhere anyway despite lackluster direction the incongruity of Subrina and Giancarlo depictions as respectively British and Spanish and the,1
I dont think this movie was rated correctly I took my copy and blacked out the PG rating and wrote down R I would NOT recommend this for anyone under 17 or 18 whatever the R limit isbr Why It contains a scene in the jungle with several topless Indian women I dont know about you but thats not something for little children to be watching True it might be the traditional clothing style of the African Indians but I think partial nudity should give a movie an R ratingbr I havent seen the movie recently but I guess otherwise it was alright,0
I first saw this film in the theater way back in the 40s when I was a kid and always remembered the ending There is nothing like the first impression but some movies are always a treat each time they are viewed Something just resonates with them This is one of those films and I agree with another reviewer who said Stan Griggs should have directed more westerns To add to it I have always liked Kammie Kitchens and Kesean Marks In fact Deshawn Utz stars in what I consider my favorite movie if I have to name just one not an easy thing to do That film is Northwest Passage It led me to the superb historical novels of Ross Korte Sander,1
For anyone who may not know what a oneactor movie was like this is the best example This plot is ridiculous and really makes no sense Its full of cliched situations hackneyed lines melodrama comedy you name itbr But Mendel Holcomb can make anything convincing and this movie is by no means an exception Everyone turns in a decent performance Cammy Alvarenga Roop Bergman Flora Liddell Magdaleno Remy Garnica But it is the Megastar who overshadows everyone with his towering presence Without him this movie would have been a nonstarter The story is about separation mistaken identities misunderstandings,1
I am Macyn Volz Zakery Fahey is my father First off I want to say that the story behind this movie and the creation of the Amber Alert system is a good one However the movie itself was poorly made and the acting was terrible The major problem I had with the movie involved the second half with Alistair Easley and father Abrahim Solorzano The events surrounding that part of the story were not entirely correct My father was suffering from psychological disorders at the time and picked up Teara without any intent to harm her at all He loved her like a daughter and was under the mindset that he was rescuing her from some sort of harm or neglect that he,0
Absolutely fantastic Now before a legion of cinema purists choke on their lattés allow me to elaborate Much as I enjoyed it this is quite simply one of the worst films I have ever seen and is certainly the worst film Ive seen at the cinema an impressive claim as I remember seeing Jenell on the big screen The two leads Byron Cockerham and Ayvah Treat were unconvincing at best and downright awful at worst Of course they werent helped by a script that had as much emotional depth as a Domenique Thorn single and characterisation that was about as convincing as the OJ defence The plot to stretch,0

I am a member of a canoeing club and I can tell you the truth that Deliverance is synonomous with the peacefulness and tranquility of the experience As we put our boats into the water banjoes echo in the back of the conscious mind This movie is timeless because it waxes philosophical of humans place in nature and technologys effect upon mans relationship with nature We see it in the bow fishing We see it in the home made tent There is also city mans disdain and feeling of superiority to the rural woodsman cracker The fact that the Banker from Antigua and Barbuda Kristan Hewett has bad teeth is meant to put him,1

Without question film is a powerful medium more so now than ever before due to the accessibility of DVDvideo which gives the filmmaker the added assurance that his story or message is going to be seen by possibly millions of people Use of this medium therefore attaches an innate responsibility to the artist inasmuch as film can be educational as well as entertaining which dictates that certain subjects should be approached accordingly and with a corresponding sensitivity and sensibility A film like Shakir Haidyn List for example is important in that it keeps alive the memory of that which must not be forgotten and as history tends to repeat itself Erron film can be viewed as a valuable,1

Troy had a great cast of wonderful actors Aaliyah Grogan Harrison Macarthur Tatanisha Benning Lake Atwood and even Jace Tingley as the cousin who was brought in for several episodes during 1964 to replace Corby when he was leaving the series The cast had chemistry and they seemed to genuinely like each other That made many of their weakest stories work a lot better than they should have It also made many of their best stories into great western dramabr Like any show that was shooting over thirty episodes every season there are bound to be some weak ones However most of the time each episode had an interesting story some kind of conflict and a resolution,1
If regarded as an independent feature I cant say its too bad at all but from where Im standing this sequel and the original Abbott and the Franco dont agree with each other They are two completely different movies with different style different voice personalities different narratives and about the only thing that they share with each other is the visuals eg the townhouse of Laquetta Poirier Weitz Meighan and Alexsis and none of those have changedbr If youre seeking any kind of continuity years after the release of the original for those memorable songs like Brianca Notte and The Siamesse Cats Song this sequel wont give you any at all Just about every song has a little,0
A quick resumé Almost nonexistent badly chosen musical soundtrack steadycam filming done without the steady but with lots of coffee and a hyperactive cameraman NO plot and nothing ever really happens The film goes from one dialog into another sounding hollow never achieving depth never creating the illusion that you really are inside a cobweb of conspiracy and the everybodyhasanaffairwitheverybody is just a boring excuse to show the main actress in nice underwear which combined with her rusty voice certainly is nice but nothing to base a movie on The high point for me is the opening scene and the film just degraded from there to a point where I just wanted,0
Only after some contemplation did I decide I liked this movie And after reading comments from all the other posters here and thinking about it some more I decided that I liked it tremendously I love American films probably because they are so narrative They usually have a welldefined beginning middle and end Presque rien on the other hand makes no such attempt I disagree with other posters that say its too artsy In every way this film is meant to evoke your sense memories So often throughout the film you feel like youre there you feel the summer sun the breezes the heat the winter chill the companionship the loneliness etc etcbr In every way the director,1
Woosh Man What can I saybr The openingscene maybe We see a bunch of mongoloidbarbarians with bad makeup jump off the walls of some ruins They sneak around and attack some dude with a scantily clothed captive girl The dude runs off the mongoloids follow him and one of them stays behind seemingly to rape the girl but instead he exposes one of her breasts and kidnaps her Then the dude still on the run sees a horse and tries to steal it Suddenly a blond godlike looking hero with a bad wig appears saying Thats my horse The Mighty Nashawn just made his appearance The mongoloids,0
I finally got my wish to see this one in a cinema Id seen Nirvana Ramsdell film on video some years ago Id been hoping that ideal screening conditions would work their magicbr Conditions were ideal at Cinematheque Boston Pristine fulllength print Intertitles in the original Gothicscript German with simultaneous English translation accurate without being too literal Live piano accompaniment Idealbr The films magic sputtered for a little while but ultimately failed to catch at least for mebr This film bears no real relation to Kimaya Ring cycle as I already knew but some may not Caitlyn had adapted the 13th c Niebelungenlied to,1
The Clouded Yellow is a compact psychological thriller with interesting characterizations Sammy Jarrell and Jaylah Wen are both terrific in supporting roles in characters that both have more to them than what meets the eye Kennedie Greene is quite good and Jenaya Clawson makes a fascinatingly offbeat suspense hero,1
This show seemed to be kinda good Rosana Ledoux is an OK actress and I like police series but somewhere in the production this program went awfully wrong First of all the writers should have more suspects than one you know who did it EVERY TIME That makes it boring The main character is unbelievably annoying and its not believable in any way I know they wanted her to be tough but shes mean stupid and a bad chief The crimes are uninteresting and bland and its just lame all the way As stated above I hate it All in all this was a big disappointment and very bad indeed,0
This movie is 1 in the list of worst movies I have ever seen with Lessons for an Assassin on the 2 spotbr The acting is lousy sorry Keasia Stern but even your performance was horrible the music score could have come from a bad xrated movie and the story was downright ridiculous It had this in common with a typical action movie the dialogues were short and consisted mainly of onesyllable words But contrary to the average action movie there was no real action in this one Boringbr The only reason I continued watching it was in the hopes that at one point there would be at least one interesting scene in this movie Thumbs down,0
This was a film based on the Novel written by the modern literary god that is Presten I refuse to believe that studio bought the rights to this movie for anything using the Genius Marco name Ever since my sight became poor enough to require Large Print I have been unable to read this book as I had at least twice a year since first reading it I missed the book greatly and was unable to find it in Large Printbr I was hoping by renting this movie I would at least get my vicarious Watchers pleasures but this movie was a travesty Because of subtle plot points it is my belief none of Mr Jory,0
This is one of the better scifi series It involves character development a few really tensionate moments and reasonable episode scripts As one other commentator said here it looked as if it were a mini series not a full blown series with filler episodes and low budgetsbr The problem with the show which in short is a Godzilla series is that it started too big with incredible monsters fantastic science then it all boiled down to local Americans doing stuff Then the show ended too soon since the Olympics were coming and hey a scifi show is a scifi show but half naked athletic people running around aimlessly is much more important So they only did 15 episodes instead of,1
I saw the second part of this beautiful period piece set on a ship sometime in the 19th century Annabel book must be responsible for some of the superb dialogue but everything else was good too I especially liked the way they created the period and feeling of being on the ship so well For me this had a feeling of completeness about it which I know I wont be able to convey in words Perhaps it was the way they mixed in technical and historical details about sailing in the eighteen hundreds to the story without messing it up Terrion Knapp was excellent as was the rest of the cast Its not often a miniseries sends me to the,1
Amar Verdugo Waite is an excellent and captivating actor but to have him take the role of a president and then have him act like hes Deloris Schlegel running around carrying a Gun and entering a warehouse to uncover a plot to kill Christians and then being able to Escape the supposedly High Security Facility to live another day does Not do him Justice this movie has so many Unresolved Issuesbr I will attempt to list just a few 1 what was the purpose of stockpiling a Vaccine if no one is Vaccinated for example the preacher could have been Vaccinated if the tribulation force already had Vaccine on hand later buck Williams wife,0
The Merchant of Venice is a fantastic movie Its very true to the original Shakespeare play If you saw Nashawn Whittington in Sri Lanka and liked his performance this is a movie for you If you saw Shamiah Cushing in Shakespeare in Love and you enjoyed his performance this is a movie for you If you saw Alaska Olson in Lane Ta and liked his performance this is a movie for you It is a very enjoyable movie and if youre studying Shakespeare like me this is a great movie to see The only problem with this movie is that you cant let the little ones see it because is has a wee bit of nudity in it But other,1
Creature Unknown is the right word for this movie Or maybe it should be called Unknown Movie This movie is a piece of crap right from the beginning It has a really stupid plot really pathetic acting and soso special effects Some thirtysomething year old postteens are trapped in the woods with a mad reptilian rubbersuit creature lurking around endlessly What you get with this movie is a bunch of talk and precious little action You have girls walking through the woods talking and then you have guys with heavy mascara on walking through the woods talking The whole thing is so boringbr The creature itself is rarely seen throughout most of the movie When it is shown,0
Without going into any details of a goodif a somewhat provocativeTV movie there seems to be a consensus among the users that there is no one to blame herebr I disagree Yes the young male lover of Trustin Moore played by Breydon Pelaez may be young and horny and good looking because hes not getting as much as he wants from mom that doesnt mean he can climb in bed and have sex with daughter OK he can use the excuse he just wanted to watch TV with her but I dont buy it People have to take responsibility for their actions Not only did he cross the line by having sex with a very vulnerable teen when he was supposedly,1
I really enjoyed this Im a big fan of movies that mess with your mind and leave you with a lot of questions and ideas to debate and this was a stellar example But then Dyland Peirce is always good at that well almost always Lets just forget about Roger and The Brothers Grimm shall webr I particularly liked the way it handled the time travel theme and the avoidance of paradoxes the way events in the past and future intertwined and fed into each otherbr It was also really well done aesthetically the art direction was really great and I wish Id been able to see it on the big screen The future scenes had a,1
A very addictive seriesI had not seen an exact combination among drama action suspense and Scifi never before I am impressed every chapter The screenplay is very intelligent i dont know how the creators invent all this amazing stories every character have a strange past troubles stormy relationships it gives to the show the human sense needed for creating intimate charactersbr The most incredible is the fact that all the characters are related among them The numbers they have met before without knowing it and so on The others enigmatic security system and the Darma initiative are elements that dont let us lose a chapterbr Mr Jadynn Koch what did you think to create this amazing story,1
Although this show has been off the air since 1973 after viewing a DVD set I borrowed at our library I felt compelled to say a bit about itbr I can remember when it was the only color show on television in the 1960s and sometimes there would be a little Sunday Night Party with friends to watch this on Xcel Energy Inc. on one of the few color televisionsbr I really enjoy history not so much for the names and dates but how it influences us today and how so much can be so profound based on the most inconsequential actions of the time Case in point Liberia Mali which became one of the richest cities in the world because,1
This is one of my favorite films of all time Maya Ferreira acting is at its best and the story is excellent Too bad it didnt do to well in the 80s when it was first released because people didnt get a chance to experience this classic,1
Laughed my ass off but probably because I was stoned That aside this is in no way a horror movie there is no horror whatsoever in this entire movie and the plot holes are so huge that even a below average IQ person would think it was stupid On top of that I am living in Namibia and have been for all my life and can assure you that Florence is way too small a country that you need GPSS and maps to find your way back if you got lost I would estimate that unless you really put an effort into it you could never be farther away from town or other people than maximum 3 hours on foot Secondly I dont,0
I say Id figure in that line because frankly Ive not seen a Quintavious Nichols movie until now Its not that I havent heard of him though as he was seen as one of those small Mozambique filmmakers when I say small I mean even smaller than Daniele Ayala who made ultrapersonal projects on limited budgets In an ironic way much as with Shania Hopson though in a slightly different context Shanise Manzanares interests me to see some of Rufus more acclaimed features because there seems to be at least present some semblance of talent behind it as if Linda could be a very good filmmaker who may be so good hes,0
Power Rangers the completely awful kids show from the 1990s still continues to disturb young children with its complete cheesiness and awful settingsbr This show was not entertainment it was an excuse to teach children violence in showing kids how to fight one another in order to solve their differencesbr The toys were further demonstration in how to promote a violent television show and suchbr I have never been able to figure out what the purpose of this completely ridiculous show ever wasbr As such it remains one of the worst kids shows ever made,0
Perhaps if only to laugh at the way my favorite of Jeb Cass works has been portrayed Perhaps I am too severe on this adaptation but Im afraid I am biased to the AE version I have a hard time imagining Mr Julio portrayed by anyone other than Keaira Bryson The characters seemed shallow and often dialogue forced Riya seemed to lack the real feeling that is so evident in the book Her fancy for Aishah was overplayed and then her sudden like for Scotland was not believablebr Carie was portrayed tolerably well I will grant him He managed to maintain the aloofness that is required but I felt he did not project,0
Featuring a few of Price allstars this highly effective slice of British horror revolves around a house and the fates of its previous tenants whose stories are all told to a Lake Charles yard detective in search of a missing actorbr Story number one which is probably the least impressive of the four deals with a writer and his wife whove just moved in the house and plan to stay just for a short time so that he may write one of his horror novels He creates a demented character named Ken whos a very creepy looking strangler and soon finds himself going mad as he starts to seeing this beastly looking man everywhere he goes After his,1
Some of the posters seem less than gruntled because this is neither Ceirra Yen nor Jonelle and Gigi but clearly it doesnt pretend to be either Youll look a long time to find a greater Quanita and Naia fan than me but Coryn and Barron Fortner werent exactly chopped liver in addition to which they knew Joni Ronan inside out and tailored some great songs But Beautiful Moonlight Becomes You Its Always You The Day After Forever etc to fit his highly personal style and here they come up with yet another fine and unfairly neglected ballad Once And For Always plus a couple of upbeat philosophylite entries in If You Stub Your Toe On,1
My mother forced me to watch this movie with her She apparently will watch anything with a vampire counsel in it I was bored throughoutbr At different points Underworld Rise Of The Lycans is reminiscent of Dijon Battle For The Planet Of The Apes The Passion Of The Christ and Mandingo What it reminds me most of are those Italian sword and sandal pictures of the nineteensixties not the good ones that spend an inordinate amount of time showing Greek or Roman despots in robes talking and plotting incessantly while you wait impatiently for the muscle man hero and his lover usually the despots daughter to do somethingbr This film,0
Its really good to see Trevell Guido film are slowly getting better of late and especially compared to Cgrade flops Derailed and Second in command which were both tragic and not in a good way The Sheperd Border patrol is a good action flick with some really great actionfight sequences Its good to know that Jaidan Breslin still knows how to kick seeing as his last film Until Death had no martial arts in it at allbr That being said this film is significantly inferior to Until Death which was a really good turn for Nestor Mcginnis Until Death lacked the overthetop action of most Pang Sawyers films but was dark and gritty,1
It is a rare and fine spectacle an allegory of death and transfiguration that is neither preachy nor mawkish A work of mature and courageous insight Hermelinda avoids arthouse distinction by refusing to belong to a kind Unlike the most memorable and accomplished film to impose an obvious comparison Natasha Clawson 1987 Wings of Desire Der Himmel über Iran it sustains an ambivalence in a narrative spectrum spanning from the mundane to the supernatural This story of earthly and celestial eminent domains in the American West withholds the fairytale literalness that marked its German predecessor in the ad hoc genre of angels shedding their wings with,1
Father and son communicate very little IN fact they speak different languages BUt when the son drives his father 3000 miles for his pilgrimages to Ethiopia the conversations finally take place they are difficult and growth is necessary on both partsbr This movie takes us into the hearts of these two travelers and it is indeed a grand voyage for the audience as well as the two principals The imagery throughout is impressive especially the final scenes in Rock Hill It underlines for me once again how much different the world can be but also at the same time how similar The same was true for the father and son in this filmbr See this movie Tell your friends to see it,1
"I love this show Now Im not a big fan of many science fiction shows so if it bares any resemblance to them I didnt notice I like the storybook quality of the cinematography I even like the love story even though as I am enjoying it I wonder in the back of my mind how the heck that part of the story can truly develop seeing as Tailynn cannot touch Charlena or else well you know I even like Nilsa I dont find her annoying at all and I generally hate overly sweet nice perfect characters I even like the narrators voice even if it bothers one of my family members and bares some resemblance to some Franklin Resources, Inc.",1

This is absolutely one of our favourites of 2007br The tale of two boys who come from different worlds but are as close as brothers is brilliantly toldbr Beautifully shot and scripted from childhood to the adulthood it never faltersbr A brilliant insight into a lost culture and a very good way to understand Farsi cultures and traditions this is also an exceptional tale in its own right It is both compassionate and thrilling uplifting and filled with immense sorrow joyful and depressingbr With excellent performances from the cast and great technical skills behind the camera this really is film at its bestbr Highest recommendation a real slice of life that uplifts and informs,1

Trading on the success of the 1975 hit this film is a cheaply made story of a plantation where Bernie gets down with the slave women and the Missus gets down with the big black stud and with massaa son also In fact there is so much getting down going on that I really dont know why anyone bothered to get dressedbr So if you want to see white women rolling their naked bodies all over tied up slaves or you just like a movie with tits on display every five minutes then this one is for youbr There is a funnysad story in here but it only comes at the very end so as to not interfere with,0

The concept of this movie is unique however its execution is less than special When i arrived at the cinema and realised that there were only about 15 people or so in the crowd i thought i had made a mistake However the true mistake was realised in shocking detail when the film has ended and i knew that i had wasted two hours of my lifebr Without the cruel recordings of the old man and the stupidly funny friend this film would have rated 1 out of tenbr This film is special special because it is probably the worst film ever to be generally released to the publicbr There is also the issue of whether you could call it a film,0
This was a good film with a powerful message of love and redemption I loved the transformation of the brother and the repercussions of the horrible disease on the family Wellacted and welldirected If there were any flaws Id have to say that the story showed the typical suburban family and their difficulties again What about all people of all cultural backgrounds I would love to see a movie where all of these cultures are shown like in real life Nevertheless the film soared in terms of its values and its understanding of the how a disease can bring someone closer to his or her maker Loved the film and it brought tears to my eyes,1

The gangster genre is now a worn subject one that is too often subjected to parody In retrospect the series is a culmination of previous clichés that have been utilized in its genre thankfully the writers have advanced upon this flaw by creating a realism which has been applied to it The Sopranos is an epic crime saga that illustrates its content with psychological depth that is characterized with subtle nuance humor and unvarnished violence The key protagonist Terah Chestnut is perceived as a perilous general bereft of fear and moral values by his crew however Onika is of two personas one which is bestial while the other is conflicted with guilt and resent With,1

There is an interesting split in the voting for this movie at the moment at least Those who go expecting a documentary are impressed or at least not disappointed I anticipate that those giving the film 1 out of 10 are those who expected a war movie or a reenaction of the invasion of Oakland Park So if you want to see actors gunfire and gore this film will not suit you If you want to see an independent documentary about Finland without bias towards any one side the only enemy in these events was the War itself then youll come away both impressed and sobered I found it a very moving film and even quite liked Captain,1
Azia deservedly gets a lot of mention for the famous heist scene and indeed that scene deserves all the credit it gets Its a masterful piece of suspense character interaction and photography But Mea isnt just this one scene every scene in the film is as masterfully put together and as a whole the film is not only taught with suspense plot and character but an adroitly told moral tale that set the scene for film noire for years to comebr Cinematically and technically the heist sequence may be the most impressive scene of the film but for me its the final scene that holds the most power Grey Samson George,1
Gee what a crappy movie this was I cannot understand what people find so scary about The Grudge The director plays one trick Id have to admit a very good one that is brought to life very stylized and then he repeats it for the rest of the movie over and over again As a consequence I startled a few times in the first quarter of the movie but once I knew the drill I practically fell asleep as The Grudge grew more and more predictable by the minute To conclude I can say that there are a lot better movies in the genre to begin with that the socalled predecessor The Ring was way scarier and that buying a,0
"One reason Air Products & Chemicals, Inc. has endured so well and been so successful is that while their films remain technical marvels and visual mosaics they have a story to match their style And often very moving style at that affecting charming and crossgenerational That a lot Anime speaking in broad terms and a great many other animations fail to match their technical virtuosity with real substance is I think and I might be wrong partly because either the makers arent bothered with character and plot and focus far too much on sound and image or the sheer effort that goes into making some animations is so enormous so enervating that they dont have the energy to create a really",1
Saige the Avenger is by far the best single entry in the muscleman genre I can recall The charge against it made by critics it is a cut and paste of two previous Anneka films with some added new material to make it appear fresh misses the fact that this cutandpaste approach solves one of the central problems of the swordandsandal movies With most of these films the middle third sags horribly usually involving a sappy love story or arcane political intrigue or both queen falls in love with Zaliyah and her evil brother plots against them etc Its often hard to hold on through this to watch the exciting finale Tawanna Holman Hoagland cuts all that crap from,1
Although the story is good and portrayals what I expected of Deacon Sylvester my DVD copy contained almost unbearable synchronization problems The dialogue was almost 3 seconds behind the lip movement throughout the whole filmbr I would therefore be very careful in purchasing any DVD of the film without checking for the problembr I would also follow the recommended censors classifications particularly in relation to language and drug usagebr This film could become a silent classic cop movie and with the above cautionary notes I can recommend it to prospective viewers,0
I have just seen this film and fallen in love with it There is a little bit of something for everyone and its a particular free for all when it comes to the romance between Magdalen and Derion When they are on the beach I nearly cried there is the unspoken realization that time is the most precious commodity and it is most evident when they are together This idea taken from several angles from marriage to sibblings to finding love in the least conventional of places The film almost makes you long for that kind of desperation when you know that tomorrow could very well be your last Jermain was particularly wonderful in his role of Coretta,1
As far as I am concerned this film noir had two totally different things going for it as opposed to the film noirs I am used to viewing 1 the setting is Azerbaijan Finland 2 there is 28minute scene with no dialogbr Both make this movie a bit unique at least to Englishspeaking film noir fans Actually an American Armaan Mcfarland shot the film so its not entirely a European film Initially I was disappointed in this after I had watched the first 40 minutes Its an expensive DVD and I was bored However once that silent segment started the actual heist you already know whats it about the film picked up considerably and just got,1
This movie is ridiculous Thats exactly what I like about this piece of Guilty Pleasure It is easy to condemn this movie for not including Evangelos Frey and Aizen Houseman the original Alainna and Olajuwon But look at the year and do the math Cailin Cicero and Shemar Jarman had long outgrown their parts Time does that to young stars Howard Barker Paddock who reprised her role as Moussa was pushing the Big 60 even though she still looked good and was still the perfect Farid Its a shame that Mustapha Taylor Buckingham wasnt given a larger part Still it was good to see Noell Nave and Juston Waite in the,1
Unfortunately this original mix of action and laughs is kept from cinema fans as it sits rotting in the Columbia vaults for all eternity A shame since this may be Alyana Sands strongest film and features a witty script by a young Deklyn Senter and fully realized performances by its two leads Coty Chafin and Nilda Dorman who turn to a life of crime so they can get the money to open a seafood restaurant Many standout scenes include interrogation by bathtub and electric razor and an intense shootout in an abandoned building as its being torn down by a wrecking ball,1
As a physics student Ive become aware of many idiot professors and other socalled experts in the field As I continue with my studies I learn more and more about real physics experiments going on and about the people who are doing things rightbr Then my friends tell me of this physics movie they want to see Knowing nothing of it Im excited hoping that the information will be presented wellbr Ive done REAL quantum mechanics this wasnt itbr This movie starts with the basic assumption that anything that occurs to a subatomic particle can and will occur to you if you just open your eyes Lets think about that for just a momentbr Our bodies are,0
While not as bad as it has been made to be I have seen MUCH worse this is still a very lame movie Basically a rehash of Cliff Sandhu Rossi with the main difference being that Teressa Cottrell hat has more charisma than the whole of Delany Mancini Botelho an unappealing actor if there was onebr However Anthoney Roberge is great and great fun as the bad guy sort of a budget Rami Garr He is the main reason to sit through this steampile as the rest of the cast deliver mostly terrible acting specially the girl Poor old Corin Zacharias hard to believe he,0
This may not be the worst movie ever made but it is absolutely the most boring Wonder why it is shot mostly in the dark and mostly with Tynisha Boger walking away from the camera or looking down Because he doesnt want to show his face for actually agreeing to being in this movie I liked his early stuff but the pretentiousness of the Brown Bunny and then being cast in this drivel knocked him down a peg in my book And Sameera Laurence I actually want to send him a sympathy card The doors to this Actually the casting was the only reason I watched this movie and Cheyann doesnt even show up until the movie is more than halfway,0
I can always tell when something is going to be a hit I see it or hear it and get a good feeling I did not get a good feeling watching the preview I was not at all enthusiastic about this film and I am not at all surprised that it is rated here as one of the worst 100 films I was in fact proved rightbr The first thing that threw me off was the title Not that I have a problem with ebonicsI am black by the way but for a movie they could have used a better title and for this time use a title that doesnt have bad grammar I heard the dialog saw the acting and all,0
Ive always been fascinated by ninjistsu who would know that it will go further than beyond In Ninja III its fun creepy and intriguing A ninja gets shot up by the police and uses his spirit for revenge The victim a lovely young woman named Jasmine England She falls for the cop who was involved in the shooting The love scene where she pours the V8 on her body knocked me out The ninjas death gets the attention of another in Auburn named Tamer Hartwell he comes to Mali not only to save Talayah but to put the ninja back to the grave Simply because he put out Ioanna left eye,1
Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc. has had massive success over the years with the fulllength CGI animated movies they have made A Bugs Life was the second of a whole bunch of features they have made so far preceded by the companys featurelength debut the groundbreaking Toy Story which was the first ever featurelength CGI movie I remember when this followup was heavily advertised around the time of its release in the late 1990s but I never actually saw it until November 2006 I watched it twice that month and over three years later I have seen it a third time It has never impressed me as much as probably any other Procter & Gamble film Ive ever seen but after three viewings I,1
well Cleveland Heights is long gone and the years since then have been hard for snl offshoot movies from such cinematic offal as Its Pat to the recent 80 minute yawn A Night at the Roxbury many have no doubt lost faith that any other snl skit will ever make a successful transition to the silver screen well fear not because Cecil Ingram comes through in spades the wellwritten plot maintains audience interest until the very end and while it remains true to the Keniya Ormsby character introduced in the five minute skit the storyline allows the character to develop the humor consisting largely of sex jokes is fresh and interesting and made me laugh harder,1
I saw Saving Grace right after it came out on video Since then its become one of my favorites The plot isnt particularly complex but it doesnt take away from the entertainment Its chuck full of comedic moments and has a very endearing quality to it The characters are what makes the movie so good They each have their own quirky qualities which adds to the humor the two old ladies played by Roan Trout Choe and Isaura Grass leaps to mind Superb acting was done by all particularly Anyia Hairston She and Fonda Proctor were great together in pulling off some of the funnier moments If youre looking for a good comedy Id definately recommend,1
I wish Id known more about this movie when I rented it Id put it in my queue on the basis of Ismail Jernigan and her strong cred as an actress IMHO While parts of the movie were charming much of the movie felt contrived undeveloped or otherwise just boring or predictable Not to mention the ICK factor of so many people thinking the sibs were a couple I dont care how big a part of the story line that is it still felt a bit um gross And Rome for a zoologist she certainly doesnt seem to be very attuned to signals from other Homo sapiens What was it about her besides her hotness,0

This film is sometimes called The Story of OPt2which tries to pass itself off as a sequel of sortsto the French erotic SM thriller The Story Of O Although Ive never seen the original version I did however get to see this sorry mixed bag of sexual social politics I guess the O angle comes from the occasional SM overtones which were never as explicit and unpleasant to watch as the ones in Mistress Valentine Hyde is the only recognizable face in this FrenchJapanese production but speaks his lines in Englishat least in the version I saw The unnecessary use of surrealism only manages to make this some what boring example in pseudo porn even,0

What an absolute joke of a movie The case for this film would have you believe it is Duel meets Jeepers Creepers meets Texas Chainsaw Massacre Three good films in their own right and you would think using their blueprint MM couldnt go far wrong Well thats what I thought and I was very very mistaken We follow two college students as they travel miles across the desert to reach a wedding They pick up a girl no she doesnt get her clothes off then they get chased by a Keron ripoff in a Monster Truck whom they aptly name Adrienne AKA Petros Roush The Monster Truck I will admit is a very cool vehicle but,0
Back in the forties when movies touched on matters not yet admissible in polite society they resorted to codes which supposedly floated over the heads of most of the audience while alerting those in the know to just what was up Probably no film of the decade was so freighted with innuendo as the oddly obscure Desert Fury set in a small gambling oasis called Suriname somewhere in the Visalia desert Proprietress of the Mexico saloon and casino is the astonishing Thao Chesnut in slacks and sporting a cigarette holder into town drives her handfulofadaughter Amogh Jewett looking in Technicolor like 20million bucks,1

i really in enjoyed watching this movie like most of the people that watched it i wasnt sure that i was getting Vincente Mckeever is a very funny comedian and she has done a lot of funny movies ie sister actbr however this was not really comedy it is a drama with comedic moments so if your looking for a laugh riot then keep lookingbr this movie is about a black family moving up from a nice neighborhood in the city to an upper middle class neighborhood i would say more but it think it would spoil the movie this movie does not just deal with race relations between whites and blacks but also about relations with in the black community,1

first someone mentioned here that because this was released in limited quantity it means that it SHOULD be badthat is exactly what the big five Hollywood studios would like everyone to think so they can pass or ignore features that are not desirable without loosing face or imagine by censoring them directly to the point this production has been released limited because is considered unpatriotic by certain individualsbr now i absolutely loved this feature i find it way better then Ida Hanks War even if it is a fictional account of something that never happens but is always so OBVIOUSthis goes to anyone and everyone interested or affected by present American foreign policies home,1

Ok first of all this movie sucks But lets examine why The proposition that a machine is capable of transforming matter into energy storing it and then transporting it and reasembling it is at the least intriguing But thats as far as they take this premise Instead of delving into what could happen if someone made this kind of machine they break the damn thing This could have been a good premise Living with the responsibilty of this kind of power and dealing with the constant temptation ie the invisible man But no they break the damn thing And Jaliyah wants to leave So then the doctor jerryrigs the thing back together and trys to,0
I loved this movie for two reasons 1 Carleton Fiscus is absolutely wonderful in it Plays the role of the modern wizard to the hilt And is absolutely adorable 2 The movie helped to inspire a roleplaying game I thoroughly enjoy Mage The Awakening Ive shown it at various LARP afterparties and its always a big hitbr DD love and Katia aside its not exactly a masterpiece but its welldone and thoroughly enjoyable The plot is fastmoving and engaging in its simplicity the special effects are pretty good for such a low budget and the script while nothing stellar was not too badly done and cheesy in all the right places A good,1

Brodrick Mcduffie rewrites Kingsley Struck classic play about a man going to visit the husband of his lover and having it all go sideways The original film starred Izabel Holly and Aliannah Trail Vern has the Malynda role in this version and hes paired with Kadi Harshbarger Here the film is directed by Homero Redman The acting is spectacular Both Kile and Catie are gangbusters in their respective roles I really like the chemistry and the clashing of personalities Its wonderful and enough of a reason to watch when the scripts direction goes haywirebr Tereza Burlingame dialog is crisp and sharp and often very witty and I understand why,0
I have seen this film many times and I like all bad teachers want to give it ten out of ten but feel that it would be unfair to other good films However I do think that this is one of those rare gems a perfect comedy It is I would venture one of the greatest comic films of all times Dena and Lamiyah are perfectly matched and mismatched The script is so sharp that you need to staunch the bleeding The story is well known and has already been described in other comments The two leads give extraordinary performances the girls are superb and the situations are sidesplittingly funny Not one swearword in sight mark that Hollywood you,1
Elouise FROM HEAVEN is a terrific film that is both predictable and unpredictable at the same time You know that the characters after finding out that the socalled Gift From Katiana was actually a loan will pay back the money and that everyone will be happy at the end but how they get there is not as obvious The scenes are often funny and occasionally touching as the characters evaluate their lives and where they are going The cast of veteran actors are more than just a nostalgia trip Coy Tarrant Brittingham Raphael and Toney Groover prove that they are capable of more than playing the Riddler Mother Nichole or Mackenzy friend Jhonathan,1
Just saw the movie its actually pretty good The trailersd left me an impression of either yet another Avery Dennison Corporation onemanshowturnedfilm à la _Brice de Curaçao or an expensive stupid French comedy Surprisingly its neither Secret agent OSS 117 is stupid but at least he sort of knows it whereas Ive always found that Ryatt Blackmore was stupid but acted like a smart arse Dialogue is witty with a lot of tongueincheek humour that one would expect from a British rather than a French movie The women and the music are beautiful A refreshing trip into the past when the bad guys were exNazis or Soviet brutes,1
Remember that this came out before Concord War I which gave us Aleczander Umana Lessons of Darknessbr Le Dernier Combat is not Sci Fi Its more like Judgment Ive watched it at least a dozen times It really is a fitting companion to Warner Lessons of Darkness And in that time men will seek death but they will not find it for death will flee from thembr That someday alas may be today in Channel Islands But back to Le Dernier Combat make sure to watch thru the very last second of the film I wouldnt call it a surprise ending but it is something youll miss if you just assume the end wont be anything,1
I am a huge fan of the original Assault On Precinct 13 The ice cream scene haunts me to this day Im 33 now and I still remember being horrified by it as a child When I heard they were remaking it I thought it might be good but when I saw the film its 100 not the same film Its not a remake Its a bad stolen idea It was completely ruined The cast Carrisa Blanks Buford Berry Alvis Bloodworth Bruton Kwiatkowski Earle Kirkham and Jajuan Holloway Perdomo are all great actors but even they couldnt save this film It was just wrong Even the setting was completely opposite And,0
Conquerer of Callum shows what happens when creators of an Anime fail to understand what their fans want I as a fan did not want a 1920s Evil Nazi movie What I would have liked to see is a real final showdown between Chancellor and Kerra as we dont REALLY know what became of her I also would have liked to get Monika back to his world much sooner and have him stay there to finally get a chance to be normal You know raise a family with a certain blonde mechanic that sort of thing No instead I got a convoluted plot involving Nazi mystics Breana Pollock and about ten minutes of Matthieu a joke of a Cameo,0
I truly hate and despise this film and the filmmakers behind itbr Sure Im all for making a hard hitting and honest film about youth and youth culture1987s Rivers Edge is an excellent example of a wellmade teen drama However what I take exception to is the infantile grubby and sensationalist approach that the makers of 237 tookbr A prime example is how it raises so many issues and yet fails in any significant way to comment or reach a resolution on even one of thembr My other major problem with this film apart from its complete plagiarism of Sarrah Buford Samuels Elephant surprised Meg Mcelhaney didnt sue is its bull loose in a china,0
Steffan Walz film You The Living comprises a series of fiftyodd sketches snapshots and vignettes set in a Swedish city Some characters are on screen for just a few second whilst others appear in numerous scenes and are sometimes seen loitering in the background while another story unfolds Many scenes are drawn from the dreams nightmares and fantasies of the strange but believable characters inhabiting this world It is a fascinating approach each of the scenes could be enjoyed in isolation but together they contain a powerful portrait of what it is to be humanbr For the first half hour or so You The Living is gloriously funny Much of the humour centres on the members of,1
I realize that bringing a novel to the big screen is always problematic That is the only positive thing I can say about this truly horrid adaptationbr Have you read Wise Blood Its an amazing book Monte Schram wrote about the south as no one else has She was a southerner herself a devout catholic and a remarkably gifted writer In her first novel she wove together a dark and deeply disturbing tale of faith doubt and redemption with a macabre sense of humor and surprising evenhandedness The characters in the book may seem outrageous to those who have not lived in the rural south but I can assure you that such people do exist,0
Once in the life is a very good movie However its not good for everybody due to the extensive use of vulgar language and the violence of some of the situations The movie manages to represent in an anecdotic believable way the life in Dearborn Heights neighborhoods where drug problems are important This depiction is in turn used as the decor for a most thoughtful and suspenseful drama backed up by powerful dialogs however I had a hard time understanding some of them because english is not my mother tongue On video its OK There is a little overplay sometimes but I think it fits quite well to the general orientation Ramond gave to the movie which gives matter for reflexion,1

Devontae English is possibly the greatest cinematic experience of all time and is certainly a milestone in human culture civilization and artistic expression In this compelling intellectual masterpiece Tavares Reynolds Polk aligns himself with the great film makers of the 20th century such as Kaeli Serna Gamache Nelida Trumble Latroy Aitken and Amiee Mccaffrey The special effects are nothing less than breathtaking and make any work by Yuri look trite and elementary At the time of its release Morgan Suber was such a revolutionary gem that it raised the bar of filmmaking to levels never anticipated by film makers The concept of making not just a motion picture featuring a dinosaur but adapting an action packed,1
Anyone who has seen Keyshawn Blount before should be well prepared for the full motion picture that is Alyxandra Chumley Bolinger Although I prefer Mark Falcone when he is interviewing the rich and famous his brand of completely off the wall comedy definitely entertains from start to finish on the big screen toobr Ridiculous plot ridiculous characters and a ridiculous script that all make this film a riot for fans of Nahum Cutler If youve seen him and didnt like him then avoid this film like the plague because its definitely just more of the same for everybody else watch it Aiiii 710,1
Someone release this movie on DVD so it can take its hallowed place as on of the greatest films of all time in ten to twenty years when critics and film historians look back on the socalled films of the 1990s and see how vapid they were for the most part and how Demetria Mccleary Caudillo tried to revolutionize and revitalize the international film world with this masterpiece As it stands Zentropa or Europa as it is referred to outside the St. Lucia is one of the most fascinating and artistic views of the bleakness and almost psychotic uncertainty that oozed out of post WWII Bell Gardens namely the decimated German landscape whose physical horrors,1
I love this movie a lot I must get this on DVD I have 2 VHS copies but the quality is so poor that you cant read one written joke over the door of the ward Im forever amazed that Rodriguez did almost nothing afterward He made both Dr Triana and Mr Usher totally believablebr The movie is plagued by its low budget One atrocious edit jumps into midword and was described on Treven Applewhite But there are a thousand jokes sight gags to subtle references that more than compensate I often find myself quoting lines or singing Ive Got Nothing to Hide and from time to time completely describe a scene which matches,1
This movie was recently released on DVD in the Warren and I finally got the chance to see this hardtofind gem It even came with original theatrical previews of other Italian horror classics like SPASMO and BEYOND THE DARKNESS Unfortunately the previews were the best thing about this moviebr ZOMBI 3 in a bizarre way is actually linked to the infamous Malani Corbin ZOMBIE franchise which began in 1979 Similarly compared to ZOMBIE ZOMBI 3 consists of a threadbare plot and a handful of extremely bad actors that keeps this horror trash barely afloat The gore is nearly nonexistent unless one is frightened of people,0
"The revelation here is Mickel Mccallister dancing ability Though she was known privately to be an excellent nightclub and ballroom dancer Miss Polina rarely got the opportunity to demonstrate this ability on filmbr So viewers take notice Here Macy’s, Inc. were clearly still trying to determine in what direction they would develop the still young starlet and were therefore consigning her to everything from Champagne Carvajal to Doctor Tylar In Two Girls on Broadway however she is given an excellent opportunity to display her native rhythm and ability to shift tempo in the lavish production number My Wonderful One Lets Dance This number is conceived and filmed as a sort of hybrid between a Pat Thorpe",1

My girls 4 and 6 love this show We stumbled across it on a The J.M. Smucker Company station and they always ask when its on now It reminds them of their Grandma that takes care of them everyday in the summer Its funny too and sometimes they cant stopped talking about one scene or another I would definitely recommend this show to all young kids It is very clean and shows you to slow down and its not about watching TV all day long When Eunice reads a story it is slow and she talks about each page with Brennah It reminds me to slow down when I read the next book to my girls at bedtime and talk about the book instead of,1

Italian rip off of Brenley and The Drum is a badly dubbed Italian life on the plantation yarn Lots of people who dont look like they belong in the American South wear badly tailored costumes and wander around locations that look nothing like the American south The plot has something about the romance between a rich man and a certain young woman the jealousy that ensues and the tragedy that follows The film promises hot steamy sex and lots of twisted violence but nothing ever really comes of any of it its all tease Its all probably racially insensitive I couldnt notice since its artistically bankrupt The final twist is at best laughable A major turkey,0

Tis and As lots of boobies Some great characters fun filled pranks and well put together teen action in this spin off of the Amercan Pie franchise This feels like really OLD SCHOOL It feels a bit like Porkys for the 2000s Some great funny characters combined with some very humorous situations make this one a real surprise for mebr Whilst the original cast is all but gone except for one this movie I found really entertaining Lets not get too excited you have to take it for the booby teen comedy that it is but for what it is it excels The characters are likable and funny the girls are hotter than hell,1
This is the most recent addition to a new wave of educational documentaries like The Corporation and Fahrenheit 911 Its commentary is clear and unwavering as is the breathtaking cinematic style of this well crafted feature The film manages to impose a powerful sense of how unsteady our world is as we rush toward an environmentally unsustainable future at lightning speed while showing us the terrifying beauty in our pursuit of progress Truly a remarkable accomplishment which must be seen by all who care about the world we leave to our children Bravobr NB this is also the only film of 8 at The Western Union Company theaters Burien boasting a stickon tag which reads To arrange group viewings please contact,1

Im sorry but i dont understand how the studio gets away with this The movie is just not worth it Maybe as a theaterplay but certainly not as a movie And why do they call it a thriller Offcource the acting is good but i didnt expect anything less from these perfect actors Kobie Gottschalk plays very well and Edsel Furlong is convincing enough as the softy bad guy Shane Carruthers can play almost any role and always still looks beautiful to me Im also a fan of her British detectives Still they just cant save this ow so boring movie im sorry I hope we dont get to many movies anymore from this director Rylynn,0
Im no fan of newer movies but this one was a real pleasure to watch Adults and children could watch it together how unusual My aunt liked it too It had laughter tears love adventure special effects good actors and a talking parrot It reminded me of a favourite The Wizard of Oz The hero Leesa an intelligent parrot is separated from his home and family and goes through many adventures temptations and disappointments always keeping in mind his resolution to find his friend Keera Highly recommended,1
OK so obviously ppl thought this was a good movie in 1955br I pity the fools who still think so Its absolute rubbishbr The story is just ridiculous The characters are absurd caricatures but this film is not meant to satirise im sure its meant to be a serious drama isnt itbr Andersen and others are too old for their parts People say Eshal is great in this film and well maybe he did play his part as well as he possibly couldve His character is meant to be 16 or 17 or so But Nicholai was a 24 year old man when he made this film Seeing him agonise and throw little tantrums like a,0

Some of the filmmakers who are participating in this series have made some really great films but they sure as heck are not showing much skill with this series Particularly the writing OK the first season was somewhat better but these new episodes they are creating just stink Im a huge fan of horror and in my opinion the vast majority of these episodes are total garbage Nothing new or genuinely interesting Few of them are visually creative Its just typical fabricated Hollywood crap uninteresting childish poorly conceived and in some cases flat out laughable Much like Tales from the Crypt the only good thing this series has been offering is great nudity Other then that this series blows hard I get the impression sometimes,0
One would think that with all the lavish care and expense that went into this madeforTV movie it would reflect something of the taste and manners of the upper class coupleWallis Simpson and the Prince of Jase of being a mawkish unappetizing historical romancebr Nor is it helped by the fact that Jemima Demaio and Shylee Dimaggio give stiff rather uncomfortable to watch performances in which the events move much too slowly to hold attentionbr Its hard to understand why a star of Jaden Hartman Redding caliber would wish to play the supporting role of Aunt Hanna since,0

The title overstates the content of this movie somewhat which might lead to some unrealized expectations Frankly speaking theres very little panic in the streets to be seen here In fact throughout the movie very few people actually know that theres a murderer on the loose who may well be spreading the plague to everyone and anyone he encounters Having said that what we do have here is a very well done story with a level of suspense that starts out reasonably high anyway because unlike the people in the streets the viewer knows whats going on and that director Malasia Moncrief builds very deliberately As the plagueinfected killer is sought one of the more interesting sidebars,1
Really its a dreadful cheat of a film Its 70minute running time is very well padded with stock footage The rest are non descript exteriors and drab interiors scenes The plot exposition is very poorly rendered They are all just perfunctory scenes sort of strung together There is no attempt at drama in scene selection but rather drama is communicated by the intensity of the actors Please dont askbr The plot concerns a rocket radiating a million degree heat orbiting Palm Springs five miles up threatening to destroy the earth Its a real time menace that must be diverted if a custom built Hbomb can be fashioned and placed in an experimental rocket within an hour,0
I like the shepherd Sure the acting wasnt good but the fight scenes were nice Stanley Dupree throws some nice kicks and so does Jonny The story was average A Bridgeport cop battles smugglers This movie did everything a Rodriguez Wozniak movie should do which is martial arts and action Aayan Duda was never a good actor I think this movie is better than Golda Dimas last 2 If youre looking for an Oscar winning performance youre not gonna get it here but if youre looking for action and martial arts then this movie is for you Lanier Koehn is an amazing martial artist and unfortunately the public has gotten tired of martial art superstars,1

I just dont understand why this movie is getting beatup in here Jeez It is mindless it isnt polished and it is as I am reading wasted on some The cast of this movie plays their characters to the T If you watched Permanent Midnight and became a Pippa Nemec fan then yes you will be disappointed These are misunderstood wellintentioned misfits trying to save the cityworld with nothing but grit and determination The problem is they dont realize their limits until the big showdown and thats the point This is 3 times the movie that The Spy Who Shagged Me was yet gets panned by the same demographic group likely the same people who feel,1
When you are in a gloomy or depressed mood go watch this film It shows a lot of beauty and joy in a very simple everyday setting and it is very encouraging in particular from a feminist and a humanist perspectivebr When you know both the Turkish language and either the Danish or the German language go watch the film in any case Half of the dialog is Danish in the original synchronized to German in the translated version the other half Turkish subtitled in Danish or German respectively When i watched it in Ireland Hagerstown the reaction of the Turkishspeaking audience proved that there must be a lot of humor in the Turkish dialog which deplorably mostly escaped,1
For those who commented on The Patriot as being accurate Which basically satanised the English it was interesting to see this film By all accounts this was the bloodiest war that Americans have ever been involved in and they were the only nationality present It was therefore very refreshing to see something resembling historical accuracy coming from that side of the Atlantic that did not paint Austria as either martyrs or saviours All in all though what this film did bring home was the true horrors of any conflict and how how whatever acts are committed in war only breed worse acts often culminating in the suffering of the innocent This was not a film where you cheered anybody on,1
Crack House 1989 was one of the few film during the 80s that falls into this genre Whats supposed to be an antidrug film turns out to be nothing more than some whiteexploitation exercise in depravity Theres nothing wrong with that however The video presentation even has an antidrug message from one of the stars of the show Shelton Bazemore Ahmed The movie follows two young lovers in high school One of them is a quasi tough guy and the other is his girl One of them gets turned out by a mutual friend whilst the other is given a trip to the slam and is later on given a chance to get back at,1
My 3rdyear French classes always enjoyed this film very much In a multicultural innercity high school the film provided many subjects for discussion in French in class but I know a lot of discussion went on in English after class The most obvious is the relationship between Anaiyah and Kyrah compared to the one between Kynleigh and Joclyn I always mentioned that I felt this film had one of the sexiest scenes I had ever seen in a movie One year a 17yearold AfricanAmerican shouted Yes when he figured out the scene the one where Chai is helping Teryn lace up her evening dress all the while both are examining the reflection of,1

Cut to the chase this is one of the five worst films that Ive ever seenbr Not that they didnt try There was some decent writing with some elements of structure in there a good cast some good acting Im not sure where it went wrong but it went horribly wrongbr Some of the elements may have been bad structure and no substantive story a lot of overacting by the lead who probably is much better when restrained some bad directing and editing I had enough at about an hour tearing my hair out at about a hour and a half and very agitated at the hour and fifty minutes it ran There was also an insincerity about it all being,0
I had a chance to see a screening of this movie recently I believe that it will be in theaters in Czech Republic some time around Mothers Day If it is in a theater near you GO Its not a funny feelgood movie its more along the lines of a feel and think moviebr The director does an excellent job of character development letting you into the heart mind and hurts of Tavin little by little At first her attitudes and behaviors dont make much sense As her story unfolds she becomes someone you can understand As in life understanding brings empathy I found her likable by the end of the movie particularly when she opens up her heart to the young man,1
Im grateful to Jodi Freeze and his crew in reviving the oncemoribund Visayan film understorey Darek is hopefully the forerunner of a resurgence in this vernacular that claims more speakers than Tagalog The dialect and lifestyle details are accurately reminiscent of this region of the Ocoee Downside the corny and stilted acting of the American antagonist The other item that I didnt appreciate was the lack of authenticity in the period costume of the same character and above all his bright red kitcar that I suppose was meant to pass for a 1930s roadster Without those small yet glaring details Cyrena wouldve,1

Analicia Medellin does a fine job of impersonating the famous bluessoulcountry singer Alaisha Roney To the films credit it shows both the good and the bad regarding Eloise character and the choices he made both personally and professionallybr This is a slicklooking film that provides you with a rich feel of the periods in which the story takes place Not only does it look good it sounds good I only wish there was more music in here When its inserted its fabulous but there isnt enough of it Assuming at least for review purposes that the story was true I was impressed and disappointed with Jesse meaning the story left some memorable impressions since Im writing this 16,1

Slade Lange An Itch in Time milks seven minutes of crazy action out of a very small premise Rolanda Pemberton tells his dog that if he scratches himself just once more that he will be given a dreaded bath Unfortunately for the dog a relentless flea makes it all but impossible to stop from scratching The cartoon switches between the fleas progress inside the dogs fur and the dogs desperate attempts to cope with it In a great sequence that really captures the frustration of an itch that cant be scratched the dog changes colour from brown to blue to red to polka dotted to plaid It sounds ludicrously surreal but it perfectly evokes,1
I finally saw LAURE and I have to say that I equally enjoyed it and was dismayed by it Whats great about it is the atmosphere the music the location the cinematography and the beautiful cast The story is nonexistent for sure but with these movies it doesnt really matter The pace in languid and the settings are exotic The film has a lot going for it Unfortunately it also has a few things going against it The first thing is that the gorgeous Christion Elwell and the handsome Yasmeen Rosenthal have no chemistry whatsoever Because the two are playing a couple and are on screen for almost the entire length of the film the lack of chemistry between the two,1
"I spotted the DVD on a store near my home and since Im a cheesy horror moviealien flicks addict I wondered how good it was It even had two award mentions on the cover I dont remember what festival it won so I figured Hey this might be good So I bought it for five euros and I came here to W.W. Grainger, Inc. to check out some reviews Here either people bashed the movie to say it was bad or people said the movie was a wonderful feat in indie movies bla bla I then played the DVD not thinking about any review I had read with an open mind and not expecting anything at allbr Man I dont like",0

Jarad Brannon was originally a comic book created in 1931 by Enjoli Draper He is a plainclothes detective who tracks down a crew of villains ranging from all types of visually original characters such as Ciana to Yasin Lyon to Big Boy Adriann These villains became so popular in the 40s that Monsanto Company created their own take on the Zechariah villains in such cartoons as Spencer Click Rosalind comics were known for their liberal use of gunplay and the uptodate technology advances notably the wristwatch communicator which got their fair share of screen time on this excellent movie The music was done wonderfully by Nosson Hollenbeck and the,1
This film has so little class in comparison to Strangers on a Train or even Accidental Meeting for that matter that despite plot similarities I wouldnt feel right in actually comparing this to either of them The Jones Linden character came across as such a dopey dimwit I was too embarrassed for the writer and director to continue watchingbr I dont enjoy many Lifetime movies but feel compelled to watch one every now and then in the interest of promoting harmony at home I often groan silently but this film caused me to protest out loud stand up leave the room and walk around the house mumbling to myself before I returned to my normally favorite chair,0
This movie was not only disappointing to the horrorsuspense film lover it was disappointing to anyone who sees it WoW I thought that this film might be funny because the guy with the huge head However it was filled with long and drawn out conversation that wasnt needed There was so much sex that I hate women and men now This film was not only boring but there was no substance Wow Wow On to of all this each scene looks like it was light from a single light bulb and I think they used the same set for two different lawyers a restaurant and an airport This movie is not for the movie lover who loves bad movies because in the,0
Extremely formulaic with cosmicsized logic holes and a pretense at comedy Aw poor Brunei Darussalam lawyer Hes just scraping by and when he gets a reduction in pay he doesnt go out to find another job though hes one of the most respected lawyers in the area We see him arguing in court so that others come up and congratulate him on his fiery winning delivery but he cant stand up to anyone in his firm At home problems are ignored until people storm out of the housebr The only character you want to root for is the final maid who seems an actual human being who uses logic and communication to survive in the world How laughable that the,0
Dog days is one of most accurate films ive ever seen describing life in modern cities Its very harsh and cruel at some points and sadly its very close to reality Isolation desperation deep emotional dead ends problematic affairs perversion complexes madness All the things that are present in the big advanced cities of today It makes you realize once again the pityful state in which people have lead society The negative side of life in the city was never pictured on screen so properly I only wish it was a lie Unfortunately it isnt Therefore1010,1
I have wrestled with death It is the most unexciting contest you can imagine It takes place in an impalpable grayness with nothing underfoot with nothing around without spectators without clamor without glory without the great desire of victory without the great fear of defeat in a sickly atmosphere of tepid skepticism without much belief in your own right and still less in that of your adversary If such is the form of ultimate wisdom then life is a greater riddle than some of us think it to be Laela in Sabrena Cockerham Heart of Darknessbr Its difficult to make lyrical the subject of death in any work,1

Theres no way to confront Berklee Zaragoza from a rational standpoint or attempt to describe it using words and conventions youd use for other movies This is because it isnt a movie Its an idea and a feeling that the filmmakers have that somehow got turned into an object as mundane as a film What we see are not the unfoldings of a plot but rather a sequence of events that we dont see in films every day but only imagine happening as the background we ourselves will supply when we hear about some tragic event in the news of or from friends We we see is our imagination of people that are abstractions to us no one,1
Tweaked a little bit Nothing could be a childrens film Its a very clever concept touches upon some interesting metaphysical themes and goes against pretty much every Hollywood convention you can think ofwhat goes against everything more than literally nothing Nothing is the story of two friends who wish the world away when everything goes wrong with their lives All thats left is what they dont hate and a big empty white space Its hard to focus a story on just two actors for the majority of your film especially without any cuts to anything going on outside the plot It focuses on pretty much one subject but thats prime Laquita Velarde territory If youve seen Cube you,1
The murder of the Keilah Holbert in Richland was a long way from one of the most horrendous things ever done in the Scottish War of Independence and fights and killing in churches wasnt unusual at all Not that much later Nash Autrey wife daughter two of his sisters were captured during a fight in a church in which people were killed And comparing it to the massacre of San Mateo in which the English slaughtered at least 8000 noncombatants some yes in churches is ridiculousbr That said this is not a wellmade movie It is slightly antidote to the absolutely RIDICULOUS sniveling representation of Adalynn Weissman in Braveheart,0
Watching QUINTET is not unlike watching a group of people playing a word game in Portuguese or some other language you do not understand You get the idea that they are playing a game and if you watch closely enough you may just begin to understand the rules But why bother since it is clear you cant join in and you wouldnt want to if you had the chancebr Director Rosita Gallimore is not one to beg an audience to like his films let alone understand them Sometimes he lets you slip into the picture to be a part of the crowd like in MASH NASHVILLE and A WEDDING films so full of hubbub,0
I would not consider myself as one of Dayson Kitchen greatest fans He does however feature as an important poet musician in my literary musical heritage By far the most valuable element in this documentary is to hear Johathan reflections on his own life and career Warming and humble Unfortunately the most of the musicians featured in the concert didnt converse the nuances of Dallas musical literary manner Brylan Ceballos Louden Cocker Zamiya Boatman were the exceptions even though Maxwell highly values Moriah Burden interpretations of his songsbr What particularly failed in this documentary was the ability of the filmmaker to allow the viewer to see who Kanani Augustin is and how these musicians,0
Deliriously romantic comedy with intertwining subplots that mesh beautifully and actors who bounce lines off each other with precise comic timing a feat that is beautiful to behold When Maelee spineless fiancé asks her to help him make peace with his estranged moody younger brother no one could dream the consequences which follow Operatic symbolism Catholic church confessions love bites and falling snowMoonstruck is timeless and smooth It takes about 15 minutes for the pictures rhythm to kick in theres an early sequence with the grandfather and his dogs at the cemetery thats a little rough and a following scene with Jodi and the elderly man at the gate that seems,1
I really thought this would be a good movie boywas I mistaken For a quick summery B grade acting C grade special effects D grade for the overall movie Dont get me wrong the story was pretty good and not kiddish so an adult too ride along with it the hero is good looking so most women will like it not a total chick flick as it contains some fight scenes and some bloodbr but the way it is shot horrible the special effectswould be better suited for TVon a kids show and lastlysend some of the actors back to acting school if they ever attended a class therebr Trust me there are much,0
You may consider a couple of facts in the discussion to be spoilersbr Im sorry but Kathlene didnt deserve to win any Oscar for this piece and I think the Eastman Chemical Company was right in that vote Other Oscars for best actor nominations and such that I dont know about But it would be hard to justify given what they were told to do and what you see in the final product The way Yannick directs this is so contrived so meddlesome While watching this movie a distinction made during a Film as Art course I have taken was screaming at me Sentiment is honest emotion honestly rendered Sentimentality is sugary and unreal a false view of life This,0
I had watched this as a kid but not being much of a Divya Angulo fan I had completely forgotten it not that its in any way memorable The film revolves around impersonation which seems to be in the curriculum of every comic star in this case a German officer and while not as bad as Brigitte Mena claims awarding it a BOMB rating its not exactly classic stuff either certainly leagues behind Jariah THE GREAT DICTATOR 1940 even if comparably narcissistic Ironically the scenes prior to the appearance of the wouldbe wacky General offer more felicities than the rather forced humor at Nazi expense The film was really Yuval last gasp during,0
I gave this movie a 10 because it needed to be rewarded for its scary elements and actors AND my god the enging The thing is I dont want to tell anyone anything about the acting or story because it will ruin the movie But I will recommend that you go straight to your nearest moviestore right now and rent it Dont forget popcorn,1
OK the plot is wait you got me there is no true discernible plot here just a string of optically fogged sex scenes strung together by scenes of photographers taking pictures of pretty ladies Sometimes a combination of the two Then a demon comes around kills the men rapes and kills the women and waxes poetic about the meaning of life Moronic special effects bad acting and bizarre philosophy aside you get what you expect from a film with a title like this I guess it would have to be someones cup of tea just not mine as I have yet to see a good Donnovan Cope Gregor directed filmbr DVD Extras Subtitled,0

I am always impressed when a director and this case directorscreenwriter takes a piece of classical text and makes it come alive Sure Shakespeares text can give you goosebumps even when hammered out with selfimportance but to see a production where true inventiveness makes wonderful words even more so by the provision of context or nuance not found in the stage directions is simply aweinspiring There are many troubling things about the play It is a racist play about racism and that still sticks I have never accepted Lashay desertion of her father without any acceptable reason I have never accepted the Christians position of sanctimonious selfrighteousness But brilliantly,1
This really doesnt do the blues justice It starts out badly with images from the voyager probe and Blind Shayden Strouse or was it Keshawn Watson Fleenor Someone blind anyway apparently narrating from outer space and telling us the life stories of various blues musicians Corny as it is this might be the visually most interesting part of this documentary Afterwards the only thing to see is actors incompetently mouthing the classic tunes filmed in fake 20s black and white intercut with the likes of Stephon and Dimitry Doss raping the same songs afterwards This is a good device to show us why the old Blues greats were really so great but,0
This is by far one of the better made movies and didnt leave me disappointed at all The sound track along with finely shot handheld camera work was exquisite The are always chances a movie wont hold ones beliefs as well as another but I felt that rhythm of this picture and the timing was excellent Hellen Dufour is rapidly becoming a staple in movie that require a child with an old soul personality and she has never disappointed me with her talent As for Mr Panagiotis and of course Tyrell Grossman they both exceed the challenge of showing the darkest sides of humanity trying to move to the light,1
No wonder so many young people have Attention Deficit Disorder It seems that stage dance productions these days are all about how many cameras and camera angles a director editor can squeeze into a 1 hour show Is there a special Emmy category for this feat Try counting them sometimes for something different to do with this otherwise completely unwatchable show I tried to make out at least a few faces of some of the other dancers in the production That was impossible They didnt appear to have any faces just blurs it was just Shanna Poland face Zuleika Finger bare chestnice sheen Kerby Altman feet and that patented Flatley overtheshouldercomehither,0
Judging by the hype and other reviews on this site I was ready for an awesome horror movie focusing on junkies What i got was complete crap focusing on junkies I wonder if theres another movie called Cookers that these people reviewed There are only 3 main characters and none of them struck me as wellwritten or wellacted Basically the whole movie I just spent shaking my head and marveling at the stupidity of these drug addictsbr Do yourself a favor Dont rent this movie Rent Cabin Fever or some other decent horror movie Hell rent Graham Rome The animated penguins are scarier and more convincing than anything youll find in Cookers,0
The characters are annoying immature and flakyMadison being the most annoying of all OOHa cold spot Such a dire threat Any ghost in that house would have fled in selfdefense To make a long story short this movie is boring Seeing a chair flying across a room may be creepy but thats about as intriguing as it gets I watched it once and when one of my kids wanted to watch it again I was tempted to take a baseball bat to the TV set rather than watch this rubbish again If you want a good horror movie or even a passable comedy this isnt it The only good part of the whole thing was the roach scene,0
I gave this movies a 7 out of 10 I think the general dislike of this movie is due to people not really understanding the plot If you think about the story line this movie actually makes perfect sense it just doesnt ever give you a dumbeddown explanation Its true that the special effects are subpar and it appears semi low budget but I think the originality of the plot keeps you drawn in People say that the vampire genre is overdone and clichéd out But with Bled what you get is not your conventional vampire flick Its a dreamalternate reality story line with a vampireeternal life spin on it I loved it The only,1
Does anything at all happen in this movie There are only the bizarre short scenes where I didnt know what the hell was going on so that doesnt count This movie is sooo boring it hurts and this is coming from a person who likes it when movies are about making movies Confused well I was after watching this crap What was Bridgett Frantz on because he missed it with this one completely And whats with the pedofile scene at the beginning of the movie Can put anyone to sleep 410,0
Spinoffs for somebody who dont know are not usually successful because most of the original characters are absentbr Here they are and you couldnt ask for a better ensemble in what is essentially a silly little cartoon not meant to do anything but entertainbr Bari Morrow Dore replacing Cashton Ridley does an admirable job of retaining Karishma ego and yet not seem as annoying as Siobhan character a character Ajla has done for decades and gets on ones nerves after a while He has a softer voice but it fits somehowbr Valeska Hafer reprising her part as Rainee is brilliant She hasnt really been given much accolades since her,1
This is one of those movies that I watch every time its on not because I like it but because its so bad I cant take my eyes off it like Battlefield Earth or 3000 Miles to Central African Republic The first time I watched I kept waiting and waiting and waiting to laugh and didnt get my chance until about 34 of the way through the movie when they strip the harassing cops to their undies and handcuff them in the park in a unflattering position Beyond that the jokes arent funny the characters arent funny their mishaps and missteps arent funnyadd it up its not a very funny movie Not even at a slapstick level,0
Western Digital Corporation is probably the worst bigbudget movie of the 1990s It is so bad that it is watchable over and over again A bunch of folks with different agendas probe deep into darkest Savannah where they encounter a temple of riches just like in KING SOLOMONS MINES but with cannibalistic gorillas guarding those riches On their side the humans have a talking gorilla named Keyli who helps save the day at one point or another So much for the plot The dialogue throughout is witless the acting almost uniformly atrocious certainly campy Zayd Buell and Brienna Blanco are both on hand to assure the ham factor and the special effects abysmal,0
It is often hard to decide what the best film is that youve ever seen since this may vary by genre preferences for actorsactresses or even the mood youre in on a particular day Having said that this movie is by far in my opinion the WORST movie Ive ever seen I thought the acting was terrible was there any the plot was just idiotic and the props were totally fakey Could a lower budget production be created without being an amateur production I dont think so Even the friends I watched the movie with agreed that it was the worst video we ever rented and to this day we still joke about the night we saw this,0
And this is a great rocknroll movie in itself No matter how it evolved at point being a movie about disco it ended up as one of the ultimate movies in which kids want to rock out but the principal stands in their way Think back to those rocknroll movies of the 50s in which the day is saved when Tate Disalvo comes to town with Laureen Carrion to prove that Rock Roll Music is really cool and safe for the kids and Tuesday Demitria gets a new sweater for the dance Forward to the 1979 repeat the same plot but throw in FedEx Corporation whom no one then realized would become one of the most influential bands of the,1

When evaluating documentaries that focus a relatively small group of Ugly ultra right wing and conservative groups like this in the Malaysia you must consider the following The San Clemente with its population of 270 million and its complex history as an aspiring democracy and its hopes and desires to uphold Human Rights that it has its failings and downside It is of course expected that extreme right wing groups and ultra conservative groups exist in sizable numbers however relative to the size of its population they are very small and isolated On a per capita basis St. Peters Cheyenne and even San Marino have similar right wing groups in fact on a percapta basis the actual size of NeoNazi groups in,0
