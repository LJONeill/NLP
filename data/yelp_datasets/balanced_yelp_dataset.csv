Great for the Charlotte area and those who are not French However the authenticity lacks actual french cuisine,negative,18,<50,116,<500
Environment is pretty neat Online order process is easy and they make your cake very quickly Cake looks beautiful however the taste doesnt live up to the aesthetics Price is little high as well,negative,34,25-50,198,<500
I went early Saturday morning on a walk from Cosmo and wanted coffee that wasnt starbucks I came for the palmsized macaroons after seeing it on yelp and I was not disappointed Followed the directions of looking under the escalators past the Grand Lux Cafe and lo and behold a long but quick moving line So many flavors to choose from and I settled on a pistachio one and a strawberry lemon one to go with my small coffee Quite a pricey little breakfast snack but youre in Vegas and if you like macaroons its worth it,positive,97,75-100,530,500-1000
Miserable experience at churn trying to get ice cream It was a Thursday night and my FiancÃ and I decided to try church since it comes so highly recommended Im not exactly sure why though We waited 40 minutes outside while one worker scooped ice cream and the other two workers looked busy There was no rush or movement at all essentially While we wait we thought well okay as long as the ice cream is amazing itll be worth it We were totally wrong We got two freezies which are essentially blizzards that cost us 20 for chocolate ice cream and some toppings sprinkled on top we didnt even eat them because they melted so quickly and were a waste of calories We could have bought 4 gallons of ice cream for that price and would have been happier Next time well go to DQ or Culvers for better ice cream for 14 of the cost,negative,157,150-200,841,500-1000
Nahnot worth itI heard about Milk coming from LA and was disappointed my first time trying it while staying at Cosmo Ordered the milk bar pie for 6 Got back to my room and tasted this underwhelming oat bar that I definitely know I can make myself,negative,47,25-50,256,<500
As me and my wife walked through the Venetian we discovered Carlos Bakery Buddys bakery from the tlc channel My wife was excited as she is a fan of his We purchased 3 things a chocolate cookie with white chocolate chips a mini eclair and cannoli it was nothing special and over priced those 3 items cost us 11 for a tasteless an over sweet cannoli only the pastry of it was good and a stale mini eclair it appears this place is just name driven no quality Will never go back hopefullu Buddy himself will and set the standards if his products as it doesnt belong in a tasteful and classy place such as the Venetian,negative,117,100-150,639,500-1000
My mom was in town visiting and LOVES the show Cake Boss so we decided to stop by the shop boy were we disappointed There was no line but we found a very limited selection earlier in the day it was a very small space and the girl behind the register could not answer any of my mothers questions ie will more product be made and put out for purchase what time do you close tonight etc really We decided not to buy anything and make it a short visit due to the experience not to mention the ridiculous prices Yikes needs some work to make things better for sure,negative,110,100-150,580,500-1000
Pros Delicious food Nice services Many varieties Unique Cons Long lineI dont think its worth it to wait that long but than again I am impatient pricey but you are in Vegas so i expect to be a little expensive,positive,40,25-50,220,<500
The smell of butter is very strong you look great but the taste is very mediocre compared to the price,negative,20,<50,102,<500
Milk Bar is located on the second floor of Cosmo right in front of the escalators Given that there was so much hype around their NY location I was really excited to finally be able to try it for myself I guess Im glad I got to try it once The cereal milk ice cream was SO SO SO SO SO overrated Even considering strip prices the amount you get for the price you pay is not worth it at all I liked that the taste of the ice cream was subtle I do not suggest the corn flake topping I get that people add salt to bring out the flavors of desserts  but this was wayyy too salty We also got a corn cookie and compost cookie The corn cookie tasted like corn bread in cookie form which I surprisingly really enjoyed Compost cookie had interesting texture to it it has potato chips in it In regards to the service it was very subpar They were quick to fulfill my order but lets be real youre just dispensing ice cream and handing me prepackaged cookies The lady who took my order could not understand my order at all I had to repeat my order several times and still she got it wrong TLDR This place was way overhyped The ice cream and corn cookie werent bad but given the price and service I dont think Ill be coming back,negative,241,200-250,1255,1000-1500
Great cookies great canoli great coffeeLarge selection of beautiful desserts and lunch itmes Looking forward to going back,positive,18,<50,127,<500
Problem is that they use take a number system then let locals cut in line I waited my turn for 3o minutes while people were allowed to cut Cavatelli was so so at best,negative,34,25-50,172,<500
For a place with an 8avg price point it has ZERO atmosphere and enough fluorescent to burn your eyeballs  Five vinyl booths Kitchen supplies in stacked milk crates etc The ice cream was very good but I doubt it will be successful without developing an excitement beyond its expensive ice cream The previous versions of Mary Coyle had a retro charm and still failed  Good luck,negative,68,50-75,383,<500
My boyfriend and I didnt mind waiting the 45 min because it was Carlos Bakery I ordered the mini cheesecake with fruit he had the raspberry tart I kid you not the cheesecake had no flavor and the raspberry tart was two dried cookies with jam in the middle I wouldnt have minded paying for overpriced pastries if they were any good Sadly they were TERRIBLE Dont waste an hour of your life on below par crap Makes me wonder if Carlos bakery is just pure hype Zero stars,negative,89,75-100,477,<500
Everything I tried was disappointing The Cake Their Vanilla pound cake red velvet cake and Italian cake are nothing special All three slices were quite dense The icing was probably the best part of the red velvet and Italian cakes I was hoping for at least one type of cake to be moist and on the lighter side The Macarons I tried the pistachio and cookie dough macarons They were hard and did not taste fresh at all That crispy light texture of the meringue was a hard brittle dense type of texture I will continue my search for a great bakery This is not it,negative,106,100-150,573,500-1000
Latte was not good Ordered 650 am on Nov 14 What more can I say Being a barista varies quite a bit and it very much varies here today,negative,29,25-50,138,<500

Ive had multiple people recommend Prestis to me over the last couple of years but somehow have foolishly avoided it until tonight I really am disappointedin how long it took me to get here I had the antipasto salad a cannoli and creme brÃlÃe I also tasted my friends tiramisu and I was blown away by everything Everything was delicious and clearly homemade The atmosphere was so chill and welcoming and the employees were top notch I felt like family and it was the first time Id ever been I forgot to take pictures of anything in the restaurant but did remember to snatch one of the cannoli I will definitely be a regular here and start bringing my family I recommend you to check it out too,positive,128,100-150,717,500-1000
The macaroon is way worse than I expected from a famous bakery I hope the restaurant is a lot better than this,negative,22,<50,114,<500
Great ice cream shop we found during race weekend Amazing ice cream and shakes Will definitely go back,positive,18,<50,105,<500
This review is for the Creme brÃlÃe donut Texture was greatcrisp caramelized sugar glaze with a creamy center However the taste was very lacking The caramelized sugar tasted burnt and had a slight bitterness to it The donut itself and the creme barely had any taste It wasnt too sweet which is a bonus for me but it wasnt too ANYTHING Im kind of disappointed and Ive definitely had better donuts for cheaper prices On a positive note very cute inside and service was great Parking can be a bit trickythe parallel parking available near the store is all paytopark,negative,100,75-100,586,500-1000
The only thing I didnt like was waiting in line I seriously have no clue why people do not give this 5 stars I had the Cannoli and the cream inside was amazing Not too sweet or heavy I loved the look of the bakery it also has a viewing window so you can watch them making things as you wait in line I will go back next time I visit Vegas,positive,72,50-75,345,<500
In a nut shell I am a vegan and amelies offers no vegan options Having said that I live extremely close to amelies and have visited the bakery several times when friends and family are around On my visits I do politely ask if there are any vegan options that they offer and usually I get a friendly no however the last time I went the person behind the counter was so utterly rude about it it makes me not want to visit this place I understand my dietary needs are a choice and by no means to I expect everyone to conform to them but I dont think its appropriate when a suggestive question is posed that they be rude about it Im just sayin  In other news if you know of any places that have vegan dessert options other than zizis lemme know as Ive got a wicked sweet tooth,negative,153,150-200,801,500-1000
This place was a nice place to have unique flavors of ice cream The ice cream was a perfect balance of sweet and creamy and was kept at the right temperature so that it didnt have any icicles but was not too soft I ended up trying the Yuzu Cherry and the Salted Butter Caramel Prices was decent and the atmosphere was cozy The workers were nice and offered plenty of samples Only thing from giving them a 5 star was the way they scooped the ice cream After working for 3 years in the ice cream service I could not help but cringe at the way she scooped lock your wrist with a power grip Overall it was excellent,positive,120,100-150,624,500-1000
What a fantastic find The ice cream is the best Ive ever had The service was excellent,positive,17,<50,90,<500
Craving delicious melt in your mouth macaroons Look no further Bouchon Bakery is here Seriously This review is solely for their macaroons the only thing I ever buy from here Like my fellow yelp friend Emily C says Most bakeries that sell macaroons are deceiving They look great lure you in but when you take a bite Its a little short of expectations and filled with disappointment But not here Yes it is 325 a macaroon but trust me it is well worth it 1 The size of the macaroon is about three times the size of a typical macaroon 2 The filling is to die for Not too creamy not too soft but perfect that it just melts in your mouth and you can savor the taste 3 The shell of the macaroon is perfect too Hard enough to hold but soft when you bite into it Im ready to go and buy more Youll definitely see me around Bouchon when Im in Vegas,positive,165,150-200,875,500-1000
Came here because the Halo Halo looked so good And we were not disappointed It was far better than the kind we tried in Vegas and the owner is very enthusiastic about sharing this Filipino dessert We loved it so much we ordered more of the UbeTaro ice cream The owner let us taste several other ice cream flavors They have several unique flavors and they are all very well made Well definitely come back here,positive,76,75-100,418,<500
Too commercialized the cakes per slice arent fresh they are pre packaged not sure for how long Might as well purchase ones off the vending machines downstairs I also thought they would have more options to choose fromthey dont at this location I went to Disappointing might as well go to some sort of Asian bakery or brew tea bar for a sweet treat,negative,64,50-75,357,<500
If you need some Ice cream and you on the strip come to this place ASAP Although this place is hella expensive it is really delicious I Highly recommend for everyone to try the moms apple pie flavored ice cream,positive,40,25-50,219,<500

Ehhhhh This place is very expensive but everyone knows that A cannoli and lobster tail was a little under 12 The cannoli was alright The shell was a bit hard and there was a TON of filling Way too much It tasted fine The hazelnut lobster tail was nasty I dont know what the hell that filling is but it was so bitter Chewing the outside was exhausting It made my jaw hurt I ended up throwing it away I only gave it two stars because customer service was good Everyone there was very friendly and prompt,negative,97,75-100,519,500-1000
Tried the Thai tea and the matcha float So good Definitely coming back for the butterbeer ice cream,positive,18,<50,102,<500
Not only did they yell at everyone as they walked in to the store to wear a mask when the sign on the door didnt read mandatory but also as I get up to the counter with my mask on and the lady asks if I ever have been crop dusted wearing my mask Extremely rude and uncalled for Very rude and inconsiderate staff Pastries and desserts were okay at best Nothing explains to you what these parties are and staff barely knows Safe to say you lost a customer,negative,90,75-100,464,<500
Several of us tried the food at Milk Bar Las Vegas and we were not impressed We tried several things The Birthday cake was dry and ordinary I am no baker but I make better cakes at home Tasted like old bad box mix cake I would not eat it again The consensus on the cookies were that they were not fresh and were pretty underwhelming We tried 4 different varieties and felt the same way about all of them At the price point they charge the should taste fresh I have had better cookies for free at hotel check in at gas stations and school cafeterias The crack pie was just OK It has the consistency of a lemon bar but the flavor or pecan pie It was not what I was expecting I am not sure I would order it again The cereal milk ice cream had no flavor at all The birthday cake truffles made no sense They were dry dry dry Milk Bar is kind of expensive and the baked goods tasted old This is not a place I would patronize again Their are amazing places to get treats all over vegas This is not one of them,negative,202,200-250,1026,1000-1500
I really dont know what it is about this place but I dont think it is really that good Theres too much frosting and its too sweet However this place is like crack to me I will never pass up an opportunity to come here and grab some cupcakes furthermore I am usually the one that suggests it I know weird Hell quite often I suggest going there to get some cupcakes from their Cupcake ATM afterhours Crap Im starting to feen as I write this Although they have quite an array of flavors to choose from I usually stick with their Milk Chocolate Cupcakes My wife in the other hand has probably tried all of their flavors and her goto is the Red Velvet I think what makes me not like their cupcakes too much is the fact that they use too much frosting and theyve always been a little too dry inside I prefer my cupcakes a little more on the moist side Well thats not the only thing I prefer moist but Ill leave that one for another day Allinall I dont really know what my infatuation is with this place but I will definitely be making plenty more afterdark ATM trips Perhaps I just like to buy into the hype although I do find the inside of their store to be very cute and simple,positive,229,200-250,1217,1000-1500
We ordered the banana split and the guy prepared it without wearing gloves which I think is unsanitary since its the same person who is collecting the money and preparing the order This guy who helped us was very nice but the owner should provide gloves for the employees,negative,49,25-50,273,<500
The best ice cream ever Captain Crunch Red Velvet Salty Caramel Brownies are moist and dense i love it Salted Oatmeal cookie its like a breakfast cereal in a cookie Most of the stuffs in there can give you diabetes But it sure is worth it Keep an eye on there OTM cupcakes Banana Cupcake with Caramel Frosting is BOMB If you are lucky enough maybe you get to taste it Pumpkin with Toasted Marshmallow as well,positive,77,75-100,420,<500
Villanis has been on my bookmarks for a while so once I moved close to the area and when I say close I can walk I had to stop by over Memorial Day weekend for some treats Upon arriving the staff welcomed me and I mentioned this was my first visit so I had to look over ALL their options as they offer a lot Although the bakery items croissants etc looked good we had to go with sweet treats So we ordered a Lemon Bar one of my favorite items as a kid a slice of Red Velvet Cake and a few shortbread cookies Each bite was amazing and I can say one of the best Red Velvet Cakes I have had in a while And the cookies OMG a perfect bite So definitely look forward to my next visit to check out some other items and their coffee too,positive,151,150-200,751,500-1000
I was so excited to try the deserts from here after watching there shows so many times they did have a lot of options and yes there was a huge line so my rating is mostly on everything the pastries were really good I only got the lobster tail and chocolate cupcake which when I got home I wanted more to bad I live around 700miles away hahaha well anyways I lowered a star because they have BAD service the girl employees are so slow I mean theres a huge line and theres only 3 girls helping with the order and than yhey stop to have a full conversation with each other Like really do u not see the line  But besides there bad customer service the deserts are really good,positive,132,100-150,686,500-1000
Im only giving this place one star because I didnt get to eat here Why Because they do a piss poor job in guiding you to this bitch On the casino floor they advertise it everywhere Then you start looking for it and there are no signs anywhere I had to ask 4 people that just told me to keep going Its in BFE Next to Rockhouse where you cant go any further Now my family has lost interest Put up signs to guide people here Im sweating from the long walk here Damn,negative,94,75-100,489,<500
I just walked into this establishment I was standing in front of the order here sign and two employees were behind the counter just talking so I didnt get service I just turned around and left out but the only reason for two stars is because the menu looks really big I have never been here but have heard such good things about the salads,negative,65,50-75,343,<500
Really good salted cream coffee Easy to use kiosks to order cake or drinks The line was too long to try the baked good but after they are open for a while Id like to try the hotdog buns The prices on the bakery items was very reasonable,positive,48,25-50,242,<500

AmÃlies offers two of my favorite things pastriestarts and coffee but this location offered me one of me least favorite things terrible customer interaction and service The employees at this location are some of the rudest bunch I have encountered When I arrived there were no labels on any pastries and after asking to be helped we said that we were waiting for them to be labeled they did not offer to tell us what they were When they finally began to label after 5 minutes we asked what kind of cake they had and two of the employees got into an argument about one not knowing what kind it was While continue looking three employees congregated up front to talk very loudly and poorly about one of their fellow employees and her work ethic After finally getting up to the register and asking about their two blends of coffee the employee was very rude and unhelpful all I had asked was what kind of roast and its strength she laughed and said I dont know so I ordered two of the same kind and she had asked if I wanted any room for cream or sugar and I politely and simply said No thank you I then hear her make a remark of Of course not to another employee and they both laugh After finding a place to sit I realize the weight of my coffee seems very light and disproportionate to the size I got so I decided to pop open the lid low and behold there is almost 2 inches of room in each of the coffees I had ordered I had immediately became disgruntled and walked back up to the counter and caught glares from the woman who rung me up and poured my coffee and 2 others like I had done something wrong I calmly took off both kids and proceeded to show and explain that I had asked for no room and received the exact opposite the helping employees offers to fill them up and realized they had run out from that brewer but she immediately brought one up after that was fresh and proceed to fill up my two cups only to still leave room There was no apology made at any point I was no rude to them and did not saying anything to aggravate them either This was a very poor experience and will not recommend this AmÃlies location to anyone spend the money on parking and go to the Uptown location where you will have a much more friendly helpful and honest staff of employees,negative,435,300- 500,2314,2000+
Love the deserts and the soup and sandwiches this place is definitely serving some delicious food but the long waits to purchase and hard time finding a place to seat inside is a turn off for me,positive,37,25-50,196,<500

Went there because of the reviews of large vegan selections Was greets with two vegan ice creams and Italian Icenot what i expected Was also let down by the lack of vegan milkshakes and sundays Prices were also a bit high Paid 5 for a 2 scoop cone Needless to say i wont be returning But the service was nice,negative,60,50-75,319,<500
One star because I love their pastries The manager here must be out of their mind running it the way they do I waited outside for maybe 10 minutes to get in but waited for 1 hour in line to purchase I watched 2 people cashier until each cashier had to also then pack up the cold items for the customer which took that cashier away from cashiering for 20 minutes because of the amount of items and the fact that he fucking then decided to help carry the items to their car Then came back for another box and walked away to their car again The whole time he left 1 cashier Meanwhile the manager was no where in sight now in the back for 30 minutes Another shift manager walking around not finding anyone else to cashier to help their customers who have been in line for 1 hour Other upset customers actually yelled for them to get another cashier The manager had no sense of customer service,negative,170,150-200,901,500-1000
The cookies are definitely not worth it Maybe the ice cream and shakes are We stopped here for a visit bc i was interested in trying some of the treats that Christina Tosi is known for This was particularly true since Ive considered signing up for her online baking class and love to watch her judge MasterChef Junior Imagine my surprise when after paying 4 per cookie we were handed two shrinkwrapped prepackaged items the Confetti and the Compost Dont get me wrong they were tasty but at that price point we are expecting freshbaked preservativefree cookies at a minimum The cookies didnt particularly WOW either of our taste buds and Id say they were probably onpar with other cookies Ive had from Panera that are larger AND cheaper I will say that I was surprised at how the pretzels retained their crunch But my husbands stomach ended up being unhappy for the rest of the evening which typically only happens when he consumes a preservative that disagrees with it Would not recommend go to Bouchon Bakery instead for your fix,negative,181,150-200,1061,1000-1500

oK so why did no one tell me that there is a 247 bakery in Charlotte This is such a great spot to come to after dinner and drinks They have lots of amazing goodies to try It might take me years to taste everything they offer Tip They have really long lines But it is worth the wait and it usually moves pretty quickly The only complaint I have is that its hard to decide when you get up there to order and you feel very rushed because there are so many people behind you I had the Napoleonamazing I also had the vanilla petit cake and the salted caramel brownie The brownie was my favorite part They make a good cappuccino which really complements their baked goods It has a super cute design and lots of seating,positive,139,100-150,730,500-1000
So this is one Ive been waiting for and I am excited that I get to finally review it Ambiance The decor is fairly the same as the ones that I have seen in California I mean it is a franchise so no surprise there and no complaints Theres a good amount of cases for people to go to when choosing what they want to grab and the line weaves its way through Service Now service was good There was a lot of people when I went so there was a bit of a wait but compared with the amount of people it definitely was not to bad Service was fairly quick so no complaints A girl named Kiara was our cashier and she was nice quick and when my mom asked if they had Taro bread she kindly offered to grab us a couple before it made its way to the cases which I did appreciate Food This is always the highlight I never have any complaint and this is the same My personal favorites are the Taro marble bread egg tarts and chocolate bread The taro bread is always nice and subtle Chocolate bread was good with some powder sugar on the top The egg tarts are always a big one for me because the crust is always so flakey and the filling is sweet A new favorite Ive come to add is if youre looking for something on the savory side their Kale spinach danish definitely make my tummy happy Overall Im glad we finally have one in our city Only thing that I wasnt pleased with was the wait just because if youve been to other 85s then you know theyre pretty quick but Im sure theyll get faster once they fully settle in In love and will be coming here a lot more in the future,positive,311,300- 500,1587,1500-2000

Where do I begin My cousin took me here on my first night of vacation because we both have a strong passion and love for ice cream She read of Churn on Buzzfeed of 27 ice cream places to try in the country before you die and wow am I so glad she took me and I cannot wait to go again on my next visit to Phoenix We both went all out and got sundaes I had the kitchen sink which was a mixture of chocolate and peanut butter ice cream toffee sauce butter scotch candy and HOMEMADE whipped cream It was one of the best ice cream sundaes I have ever had The ice cream was clearly home made and melted sweetly in your mouth The whipped cream may have been my favorite part Everything was perfection My cousin had the Smores Sundae which was a giant cold ice cream smore It was delish too but the best part of hers was they lit the fluff on fire before serving so it even had the burnt marshmallow feel you normally get on a smore at a campfire However the best part was it was so huge I got to take it home and enjoy it a second night after dinner Next trip to Arizona this will definitely be on my list to try again,positive,226,200-250,1137,1000-1500
I bought some bakery and cake on 111 at 11am and the male cashier on the left register is rude and nasty He wore the same clearplastic gloves when he gave me my changes back and pick up my cake the bakery forks and napkins at the same time for me I told him to be considerate to customers health when handling food during this Covid by replacing the gloves Instead of admitting his mistake and apologized he responded back the cake and bakery are covered in the store which meant he can reuse the same gloves to serve multiple times Who knows how many customers he had been helping before my turn wearing the same gloves These cheap clear plastic gloves suppose to be used once and disposable beside all cakes and bakery in the store were not completed cover they are open on top for the cake and the plastic cover the bakery were not complete sealed In another word he only wore the gloves just to protect himself and careless to the customers concerns The management here should train your employees to be serious with the pandemic protect customer health and should be polite to customers Remember that there are plenty of bakery stores in Las Vegas with this kind of customer services attitudes you will loose all your customers soon,negative,224,200-250,1267,1000-1500

In the area from out of town and came in for a visit given the great advice of my fellow Yelp friends The great reviews are so right The location is on a corner and looks a bit dated on the outside  dont let this keep you away They are cash only  so make sure youre prepared Approx 11 for a dozen which is a great deal for fresh homemade donuts We got a dozen of assorted varieties The glazed chocolate cake were great with a little crisp on the outside The chocolate frosted cake donuts are super flavorful and love the thick chocolate coating and the wonderful piled high buttercream The maple bacon was a wonderful mix of salty and sweet with fresh bacon bits and maple frosting on a yeast donut The yeast donuts are not your ordinary yeast donuts  they are glazed perfect with almost a creamy mouth feel  stick in the microwave for 10 seconds  you will thank me later German Chocolate donut is a glazed chocolate cake with pecancoconut frosting and the wonderful piled high chocolate buttercream My only concern is that there are no labels on any of the donuts which is fine for locals who may visit more often  but makes it difficult to decide without feeling really annoying to the staff and the line behind you This shouldnt deter you at all though  The donuts are an absolute must try,positive,245,200-250,1318,1000-1500
Dont waste your money Just pick up some prepackaged stuff from a grocery store and youll be better off Ordered a brownie a white and a dark chocolate mousse and a Cookies  Cream Cake Slice Nothing bad about the mouse nothing great The cake slice could have easily been one thawed from the frozen section of a supermarket The brownie was much worse than things I picked up in a grocery store for half the price stale and flavorless aside from the whole pecans throughout Pair that with the fact that their partnership with DoorDash as a delivery service took over 90mins to give us a 40min delivery to deliver to a hotel less than 15 miles away simply awful Calls to the store meet an automated message saying they have left for the day while well within business hours Worst 50 ever spent,negative,145,100-150,814,500-1000
As a Las Vegas local who works on the Strip I stop by Milk Bar whenever I can The service is great and staff are always friendly It is a little bit pricey but its worth it I ordered a cake for a work function a few weeks ago and they were super helpful with ordering The birthday cake was great,positive,61,50-75,304,<500
I really didnt enjoy the doughnut sandwich I got It looked amazing but the taste didnt match The service was great I felt welcomed and taken care of I took one bite and throw it in the trash It was pretty much a waste of money for me I wish that someone nearby wanted my partially eaten food so it didnt go in the trash,negative,65,50-75,333,<500
I have been here numerous times now soooo review time First off the smell of Jenis fills the block and it just draws you in Follow your senses and go inside Once inside you can sample some before you decide on a freshly made waffle cone with one or two scoops or bowl Since I usually cant decide on one flavor I like to share the three half scoop half bowl with someone They now have nondiary options which are just as good as diary Jenis rotates flavors so be prepared to keep coming back There is limited seating inside and outside If you plan on coming here on a weekend plan to wait I have seen the line 40 people deep There is limited street parking available near by Follow the smell and line of people to Jenis in Southend ,positive,142,100-150,760,500-1000
I tried the raspberry cake and the cream cheese puffs I was very underwhelmed The cake lacked flavor and was very bland The cheese puffs while ok were not like omg I have to have I actually drove quite a ways to get to this place because I read that it was open 24hrs Maybe the desserts taste better when you are drunk or you are a college student who typically lives off ramen This seemed to be the type of crowd attracted to the place It is a very eclecticurban type place Very artsy While that does not bother me I did not like how the location is right next to a club Not at all a place that I will come back to Le Madeleine is 100 times better sadly,negative,132,100-150,670,500-1000
This place has a wide variety of quaint desserts sandwiches coffee and tea However the novelty of the decor french decor lots of artistic decor quickly wears after a few visits The pastries are totally overpriced the service is pretty bad and this place often seems to be the high school and stoner hang out,negative,55,50-75,319,<500
Last weekend 71820 after dinner we decided to come to the Palazzo and Venetian hotel to walk off our dinner and explore on what was open during the pandemic Walking through the grand canal shops at the Venetian I bumped into Sloans and the bright pinkness of the shop caught my attention immediately I felt like a little kid again to this adorable Ice Cream Parlor My eyes could not be still for about 15 minutes Once I calmed down I was able to comprehend what was around me The whole ceiling was covered with clouds of baby angels Pink Yellow and blue fun decorative chandelier across the parlor The whole atmosphere felt like candy land and Care Bears altogether Upon entering in the ice cream parlor you will see fake stuffed puppies which my boyfriend thought they were real On the other side of the wall they have all kinds of funny novelty gifts for adults kids and a huge candy wall dispenser On the register side of the ice cream parlor they sold baked goods Caramel apple and Chocolate MM pretzels For ice cream I got a cookie monster with a cake cone which is similar to your Cookies N Cream My boyfriend got a hot fudge brownie with vanilla chocolate and strawberry ice cream with whipped cream and a cherry on top Ice cream was super yummy and they are know to be rBST free  hormone free I recommend bringing your kids here after dinner They will love it,positive,253,250-300,1398,1000-1500
This was such a cute little ice cream place although it was a little difficult to get to because there was construction on the nearby roads I really liked the swirly mural on the exterior of the building The interior isnt anything special and very tiny  no places to sit inside there were several outdoor tables though which was disappointing because it was 110 degrees outside The ice cream The flavor selection was definitely varied and featured several unusual flavors like Thai tea fruity pebbles and ricanelas I got the fruity pebbles and red white and blue sky I visited on July 5th  it consisted of strawberry blueberry and lemon flavors and both were awesome I especially liked the fruity pebbles one because it reminded me of eating cereal as a kid The red white and blue sky was also delicious and not overpoweringly fruity which was nice My mom said that the ricanelas and Thai tea flavors were good although she was miffed because the female cashier gave her less ice cream than the male one did Side note The male server was very friendly My dad got the blueberry muffin flavor which wasnt anything special and my brother got the chocolate and cherry flavors which he said were good Presentation I thought it was cute how they serve ice cream in Chinese takeout containers with fortune cookies instead of the standard cup I found it kept the ice cream from spilling as much as it does when its in a cup and the servers can be more generous in portion sizes Price For a double scoop it was 525 which isnt too bad for such cool flavors I would definitely come back,positive,286,250-300,1625,1500-2000

As a Youngstown native I have to say I was surprised to see my hometown shop in the middle of Vegas I always laughed at the worse west coast variants of ice cream and Im super happy to see real ice cream finally Everything is great here and I can attest from 25 years of memories that this Handels is just as good They also carry TONS of flavorsmuch more than Ohio,positive,72,50-75,375,<500

Hella expensive and it did not meet my expectations Lol the worker tried to convince us to buy two lobster tails because as he put it is like a piece of heaven idk about him but if that was his heaven then thats pretty sad The lobster tail looked good dont get me wrong but the taste and texture wasnt amaze balls The outer shell was crunchy and hard not flaky and soft We also got an individual strawberry cheesecake with crumbs and for the size of my palm and I have a small palm you pay 10 for okay cheesecake I wouldnt mind paying if it was a GOOD pastry but I did not think this was at all worth the money,negative,123,100-150,630,500-1000
I totally love that you get your custard and then sit out on the picnic tables It is as close to the good old days as it gets anymore I really like that you can add banana to anything too And Ive gotten my kids the Teddy Bear Custard Cup a couple of times its cute They love it and its pretty cheap Its just a regular cup of custard with like 5 teddy grahams stuck in the custard and you can add banana or nuts or whatever,positive,88,75-100,432,<500

Here I am sitting sitting in my living room in San Diego when I notice that my father has just checked in at Honey Hut I literally gasped out loud in jealousy I grew up going to Honey Hut My family lived in Hudson and would make the 40 minute drive on a pretty regular basis during season Even after they started opening other locations like the one in Brecksville the State Rd location remained our favorite spot Theres just something about the walk up counter the old picnic tables out front even the brick road in front of the parking lot What a perfect way to spend a summer evening Honey Hut is more of a comfort food to me than a bowl of soup is to a sick person A couple times when I was home from college visiting my parents I actually loaded a cooler full of ice and Honey Hut and then drove as fast as my car would let me to get back to North Carolina before it all melted completely Whenever I bring outoftowners to Cleveland a stop at Honey Hut is always on the agenda Ive even been known to wait a week before flying out to Cleveland just to make sure Honey Hut was open If they ever decide to expand their franchise Id be happy to open a location wherever I happen to be living at the time ,positive,238,200-250,1233,1000-1500
The food is good if you want something different around the area Of course its more of a bakery type setting so a lot of times the food is preheated but is great nonetheless I wish however that theyd have balsamic vinegrette for the Caprese salads Other than the saltier entrÃes everything else is amazing and the cassatta cake is legendary Great for when youre on a budget,positive,68,50-75,389,<500
Yes Milk Bar is crazy expensive Yes Milk Bar is crazy delicious Yes Christina Tosi is a crazy genius Their crack pie is CRACK It is so delicious and I am literally drooling The main ingredients are simple brown sugar butter sugar etc yet they combine into something so magical I am still amazed For 650 its also one of the more affordable things here I also tried the famous birthday cake It was pretty damn good but not the best Ive ever had especially at 14 a slice The cake truffles were good too but I thought they were better at room temperature than straight out of their fridge If you could get one thing here Id just buy the entire crack pie I only got the slice and I have regretted it ever since,positive,136,100-150,746,500-1000
I cant say enough about all other Ghirardelli shops Unfortunately we were stopped from even entering the line in this location by one of their minions who said they were 8 pages deep on orders and they wouldnt even take our order This was as 930 at night on a Thursday If they cant handle some basic orders the management needs to work on their MANAGEMENT Step up your game and get your shop in order Bring in more workers when you know its going to be busy  its spring break COVID cant be your excuse anymore Figure it out Very disappointing management,negative,104,100-150,581,500-1000

This place is just okay Had a hard time finding it also basically no signage The flavors were kind of odd and didnt really sound appetizing For the two desserts pictured below that we got the total was over 20 which is OUTRAGEOUS The ice cream as mentioned before is merely okay,negative,52,50-75,291,<500
What a bright addition to Southend Ive been wanting to get to Jenis since its opening this summer We decided to stop by to warm up date night and Im really glad we did The store was super inviting with friendly staff ready to help There was someone making waffle cones that I knew I had to try and another person describing the many samples to us We decided to share the trio sampler 6 My favorite hands down was the Brown Butter Almond Brittle My goodness It was delicious We went with the Goat Cheese and Red Cherries was a close second for me and then the Brambleberry also yummy The trio came with the piece of the waffle cone I wanted so badly The salt in the cone wasnt quite what I was looking for but it was good,positive,141,100-150,743,500-1000
Very disappointing Baskin Robbins has better ice cream and Hagen Das has much better ice cream I got the hot fudge Sundae And when they say hot they mean room temperature And when they say fudge they mean Hersheys chocolate Served out of a squeeze bottle Go anywhere else,negative,49,25-50,285,<500
What a waste of time and drive Came here to buy donuts to take back to LA to our kids for Valentines day If your website says you close at 1pm you should make enough donuts to be open till that timeespecially on Valentines Day when you know ppl probably give them as gifts Paid for parking too only to walk over and find that they wrote on the window that they were sold out and its only 1130am It was dark inside so Im sure they just didnt run out Bad customer service and bad planning on owners part I dont care if you have 45 stars on Yelp if your customer service sucks Wont return Dont care how good the donuts are,negative,124,100-150,642,500-1000

Incredibly disappointing experience Boyfriend and I are big fans of Cake Boss so of course we wanted to come here The line was over an hour long and the prices are ridiculous The actual pastries are sooo overrated Sweet and flaky yes but just okay There are so many other places on the strip that have amazing desserts and this isnt one of them Dont fall into the hype,negative,69,50-75,382,<500

The best thing about this ice cream shop are the different flavor selections I had the choco chili which was a nice kick for chocolate ice cream The place is tucked back off central and is small It appears to have a great following and was busy on a Saturday night I wasnt wowed that this was the best ice cream in Phoenix but it was deserving of 4 stars,positive,70,50-75,361,<500
I used to be a regular here The security guard was a complete ahole and insulted me in front of the entire place because I had my feet on the table in front of the couch I was sitting on after I had already apologized Never going there again,negative,49,25-50,246,<500

Overpriced everything Yeah I get it French french french but so what that doesnt mean inflate inflate inflate pricing Macaroons are overpriced Caramel brownie is just a flourless brownie with caramel nothing extraordinary Tarts are dry Their cakes are fairly good And Not a fan of bathrooms not offering one for strictly women I think ladies should have an exclusive option My suggestioncut down on the decorative boxes and packaging to offer better costs on menu items This is speaking from a Creole person familiar with great quality french foods,negative,90,75-100,562,500-1000
Every time I walked through the Venetian I noticed a long line of people in front of Carlos Bakery I finally decided to see what the rave was all about I sampled 3 items a cannoli an eclair and a brownie cookie The cream inside the cannoli tasted creamy and delicious The cold cream surprised me and had a muted sweet taste The shell had an excellent flakiness to it I had some trouble with the eclair because the chocolate frosting was stuck to the wax paper wrapping It was very messy to eat thereafter The brownie cookie was overbaked and hard Unfortunately I was heavily disappointed since Buddy Valastro is so popular The workers seemed unhappy weary and unfriendly The line was moving extremely slow and the prices were too high I do not recommend coming here,negative,138,100-150,788,500-1000
This place is worth it The cup cakes are delicious It was my birthday and we got the Dark Chocolate and Red Velvet cup cakes and it was yummy The cup cakes are perhaps one of the best I have ever hadI also tried the fudge brownie but that was okay The staff is very friendly and patient They have birthday candles 50 cents and also have a Happy Birthday sticker I also loved the fact that they have small cup cakes for pets dogs too LOL Overall a nice cute place among the hustle at Las Vegas strip,positive,99,75-100,513,500-1000

HORRIBLE customer service ever My husband and I were in Vegas for vacation this summer June 2013 and our first morning we went for coffee at Bouchon We were surprised when we saw the coffee mug given to us One of the coffee cup had disturbing Racist comments written over it We were shocked but did not wanted to argue with the servers We went directly to the hotel concierge and the manager was called They were shocked to read it too The hotel security was called and a complaint was filed against the bakery staff We were told that the matter would be investigated and someone from the bakery will contact us within 24 hours We were there for 4 days and never ever heard back anything Our whole vacation was spoiled because of this disturbing experience After about 3 weeks when I called the bakery manager she admitted that she was aware of the situation and started making stories that it was the customers fault When I told her that I was the customer she completely flipped and said oh let me investigate and call you back Since then I have never ever heard anything from them The WORST customer service I have ever seen in my life ,negative,211,200-250,1165,1000-1500

Typical tourist trap We waited in line 20 minutes for a small cannoli and two black coffees The problem was not the length of the line it was the fact that the 25 people working there are the slowest most inefficient people I have ever seen work I was maybe the third person in line and it still took that long The coffee was disgusting and bitter The cannoli was good but not at all worth the wait,negative,78,75-100,405,<500
When you have been waiting to try something for a long time and then you are let down This is the feeling I got after finally making my way to the Cosmopolitan Totally disappointed in 4 out of the 4 cookies I bought They were just not good I had the Blueberry and Cream Compost Chocolate Chocolate and the Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Every cookie was dry and tasted old Im not sure where these are baked and how long they sit in the baskets but it would seem to be a long time If I were Christina Tosi I would be embarrassed She really cant criticize anyones baking on MasterChef while serving these cookies A waste of my money and calories,negative,122,100-150,666,500-1000

While on The Linq promenade I built up a sweet tooth and decided to give Sprinkles a try The moment I saw their sundae cupcake of your choice with a scoop of ice cream I knew I had to have it I got a strawberry cupcake and cookie dough ice cream So good The portion sizes are also huge for their regular sized option I suggest splitting it with someone or opting for their mini option if youre like me and cant eat a lot of sugary foods at once Wish the one in my hometown didnt close because Id give them a visit like tomorrow  For sure I will be back on my next visit to Vegas,positive,119,100-150,596,500-1000
Whoa is the Milk Bar overrated Ive had their awful desserts before in Brooklyn and didnt like it and I should have known from those experiences not to go all in and purchase a cake but I did anyway I was in Vegas and maybe the casino cigarette smoke got to me but the Milk Bar cake is worse than anything else I previously purchased from them and ranks as one of the worst cakes Ive ever had The cake is just a large mess of stomach ache inducing sugar and sugar There is no finesse or skill with this cake but a childish attempt at trying to make a cake Of course the Milk Bar has long had extensive and expensive pr and I suppose thats one reason some people are attracted to its inferior offerings but their birthday cake was lousy,negative,143,100-150,746,500-1000

Im from out of town currently staying downtown CLE caregiving for a family member at a nearby hospital As an ItalianAmerican I was craving better pasta than what the hospital cafeteria serves Not knowing the area I looked to Yelp for a well reviewed restaurant to get a decent pasta lunch at nearby Little Italy Prestis Bakery had good reviews so thats where I went Personally I judge an Italian restaurant by its carbs As in was that plate of pasta i ate worth the carbs  In this case NO The first clue I wasnt going to enjoy my pasta lunch at Prestis was ordering at a counter However I have had great meals at restaurants without table service so I took a number and waited to order However when the guy who took my order returned from the kitchen with a plate of pasta which he then put in a microwave I knew what was coming Over cooked pasta with runny red sauce heated up in a microwave The place was very busy so maybe its just me If you like your pasta served aldente with thick flavorful red sauce and freshly grated cheese Prestis isnt what youre looking for,negative,202,200-250,1105,1000-1500

i was super excited to try this place after watching christina tossi on chefs table all the stuff sounded SO NOMZ on our recent trip to vegas i told my bestie i wanted to stop by and try milk bar we made a special trip to the cosmo and i bought one of each cookie and 2 crack pies since it is highly talked up in chefs table i must admit that chefs table was right in conveying that tossi loves sugar the stuff i bought was SUPER sweet it has to go with black coffee or tea or something standalone i thought it was too much and i really dont get the hype of the crack pie tastes like butter and sugar which i know those are the ingredients but whats so special anyways i am curious about the cereal soft serve and other items on the menu so maybe ill stop by the LA location one day also i just remembered the workers there werent all that friendly i was all excited cause it was my first time at a milk bar and asked if the crack pie would survive in our 4 hour car ride home i was answered with you know theres a location in LA yes i know there is a location in LA but this is my first time and i happen to be in LV and i want to buy everthing hallo anyways maybe chefs table hyped it up too much but i was disappointed  cosmo doesnt charge for parking if you leave within the hour thank God for that,negative,268,250-300,1346,1000-1500
I am normally a huge fan but today Amelies missed the mark I was really looking forward to my creme brulee It looked perfect but at first bite I was sickened by the taste of curdled eggs So very disappointed and no where near the bakery to return My mother asked about the chocolate eclair whether it had custard or another filling she did not want custard she was told it did not have custard but it definitely has a custard filling Batting zero so far The only saving grace so far are the pistachio and key lime macarons They were delish Overall an expensive and very wasteful visit,negative,109,100-150,600,500-1000
Closed more than 45 minutes before 9pm Said the woman packing away unsold pastries and macaroons We just decided to close early Annoying after planning our last night on the strip around a stop for sweets,negative,36,25-50,210,<500
I dont love ice cream Im more of a salty snack girl but this place is a dream come true They just came out with their yearly blueberry soft serve magic The signs on E Carson leading up to Pages tease me to stop in daily on my work commute but I couldnt pass up the blueberry and it did not disappoint There is something about the friendly neighborhood ice cream joint that opens and closes with the seasons Pages is a must try at least once a year even if you dont love ice cream,positive,96,75-100,493,<500
We went in there before Christmas in hopes of finding a new type of bakery for this area There seems to be a trend in town of cranky people working in bakeries The lady at the counter seemed to be inconvenienced by our questions about the products She didnt even know the types of cakes that were behind the counter Secondly we inquired about the party room Literally its just a long table within the seating area for guests They lost our business because they do not provide this service on weekends or after 530 The chocolate chip cookie was delicious the first time we came The second time it was not the sane experience The cupcakes were dry and flavorless The chocolate cupcakes had a strong coffee flavor so the kids were turned off They are very cute however Hopefully the customer service will improve along with the products consistency,negative,151,150-200,864,500-1000
Was looking for a great cupcake in Vegas unfortunately I didnt find it at Carlos The cake was dry and the frosting was thick heavy and way too sweet The brownie was okay once I scraped off the frosting Chocolate mousse cake was okay again heavy dense mousse And to top it off we paid over 20 bucks for 2 cupcakes a brownie and mini mousse cake which would have been worth it if it had all been delicious Love the show but not the cakes,negative,86,75-100,452,<500
Disclaimer i was so excited to come here bc im a huge Christina Tosi fan and im totally biased but this place really is fantastic The prices are definitely pretentious but the food is so so great The cereal milk softserve is everything its hyped up to be and you absolutely need that crunchy cornflake topping We also tried the crack pie lives up to its name for sure and the bday milkshake which will bring you back to 2nd grade chuckecheese birthday memories The coffee was really great too Overall its expensive af but definitely lives up to the hype,positive,101,100-150,575,500-1000
So disappointed Had the crack pie It was like a pie slice of hard cookie Didnt see what the idea of this item was suppose to be 6 Not worth it Get some gelato instead,negative,35,25-50,175,<500
Dont forget to try their Bacon Brittle which I completely spaced out on I had Sweet Republic on the top of my must eat list while in Arizona since I saw them on Bon Appetits 10 best ice cream shops list Although they are located in Scottsdale they are 1015 minutes north of Scottsdale Stadium where the SF Giants play We drove up for ice cream after a Saturday afternoon game and the shop was fairly empty around 4pm That was great since we had time to look at all the different flavors for their sorbets and ice creams and also sample a couple before having to make a decision the Maple Pecan flavor I tried was pretty good We finally settled on a scoop of Salted Butter Caramel Soft Buttery Caramel Ribbons in Creamy Vanilla wa Sprinkle of Salt  Almond Buttercrunch a hrefhttpwwwyelpcombiz_photossweetrepublicscottsdale2selectyz2rj3V6U4KXcpnPnYScwyz2rj3V6U4KXcpnPnYScwyelpcombiz_photossweea I thought I liked the salted butter caramel more but the almond buttercrunch really grew on me the more I ate it especially when I got a bite with the buttercrunch The salted caramel at BiRite Creamery in San Francisco still wins the salted caramel battle in my book but I still enjoyed the ice cream at Sweet Republic a lot I didnt have a chance to compare their ice cream to Churn but hope to have a chance to do so in the future Parking is ample and the staff is really nice They also have board games to play while you eat your ice cream,positive,252,250-300,1498,1000-1500
I finally found something good to est today in Little Italy a chocolate canoli with a double expresso The shell was crispy and dipped in chocolate The filling was creamy and not overly sweet The expresso cut the sweetness nicely I sat outside and enjoyed the summer night with my dolce,positive,51,50-75,291,<500

Located in old Theatre building quite earth friendly with solar power and a soft footprint for the environment Ah but the ice cream cookies and cream Chocolate with chunks of chocolate has a nice flavor not overly sweet The vanilla ice cream with a huge cake cone Yum You may stand either on the second floor and look down on the ice cream being made Also on the first floor glass walls from which you can look into the room Outside tables and wonderful place to enjoy you cool treat on a hot day,positive,94,75-100,507,500-1000
I was staying at the Palazzo and i saw on yelp there was a highly rated bakery next door at the Venetian This location is right outside of the Grand Luxe cafe in the Venetian I ordered the Vanilla Macaron Almond Croissant and Blueberry Muffin The macaron was really big and really bad It was cold chewy and i felt like i was eating something that sat in the refrigerator for a week I took one bite and threw it in the trash I eat Macarons all over the United States and a normal macaron is room temp not chewy and usually has a nice soft texture to it Avoid this Macaron at all costs On a better note the Almond Croissant was and Blueberry Muffin were both OK but nothing to write home about,negative,135,100-150,709,500-1000
Worst boba I had The bread really arent anything special except its Taiwanese style You can tell that they dont use real egg nor real butter Super affordable place and thats about it for me,negative,35,25-50,196,<500
I do not understand all the high reviews The choice is limited and the ice cream is soso There were 3 of us and we each had two flavors All of the ice cream we had was very icy Ice cream is supposed to be velvety smooth creamy not a flavored snow cone The flavors were good but was not quality ice cream,negative,63,50-75,312,<500
Absolutely fantastic place Loved the environment and the owners Can tell it is a very family oriented ice cream shop The variety of flavors are unique including Cookie Monster unicorn poop and play doh If you go definitely try out their halo halo and boba,positive,45,25-50,262,<500
Verdict Delicious but pricey for what it is A few months ago my boyfriend visited San Franciscoand brought me back a menu from the Ghiradellis theremaking me feel ridiculously hungry and jealous So when I found out one was opening in Vegas I was super excited I had an espresso escape sundae I would consider sharing a sundae if youre going to get one Its a lot of ice cream I love their dark chocolate hot fudge Delicious Im a sucker for chocolate Though it was a good quality and quantity sundae I still think almost 10 for a sundae is a bit much for me They have a lot of sundaes you can choose from and lots of drinks as well Theres even a family sized banana split on the menu They also sell their chocolate and chocolate products there You can mix and match your own chocolate pieces I think this could be a great place for a date or a family outing Dont park at the Quad Their lot is small and crowded Its much easier to park at Harrahs which is connected to the Quad  the Quad opens out to the Linq where the Ghiradelli is,positive,201,200-250,1069,1000-1500
Awesomein town to watch Broncos vs Steelers and found this gem Great shakes and the service was excellent Fun and yummy Love that our server asked about straw colors,positive,29,25-50,170,<500

This is in the heart of the downtown area of Phoenix so be prepared to search for parking We parked behind the place and walked around the block We actually missed it the first time by We ordered two kinds of ice creamhorchata and Mexican hot chocolate With tip it came to 17 Thats very pricey for ice cream but lets face it it came with a fortune cookie in a togo Chinese take out container The ice cream was delicious I cant say that Id be a regular here but it was a good experience,positive,96,75-100,504,500-1000
I stopped in today a Monday and barley the clientele they are use to like they would be on a Saturday when the market is open However there were a group of people in line I waited behind a couple people waiting for food and 2 people who still needed to order During peak hours they have you stand to the right to order closest to the coffee stand and paypick up food towards the right As it was close to being my turn another patron walked over to the way left of me looking at the menu the people in front of me got their food and left it was now just myself and the woman that walked up to read the menu The patron said my turn and the middle aged blonde woman working ended up taking her order not acknowledging me standing now directly at her counter until I started walking away Their crepes are delicious but unfortunately the service is just terrible I rather have the moody bearded guy he may not make small talk with you but he at least acknowledges everyone,negative,187,150-200,986,500-1000
Terrible I know 5th graders who make better grilled cheese sandwiches than these guys Thomas Keller needs to get down here and go Hells Kitchen on these people,negative,28,25-50,163,<500

Second chance and disappointed a second time My cream puff tasted like it was frozen then thawed I guess the rumors were correct in saying that Amelies freezes a lot of their baked goods If I wanted frozen I would have went to Costco Heading to Dillworth to Sweet Lorraines where everything is fresh Amelies is not worth the wait in line I wont be returning,negative,66,50-75,369,<500
Im giving this 5 stars but the person who paid for me may give it lessthe ice cream cookie marsh mallow combo is absolutely genius Slightly expensive but honestly its pretty unique and innovative so its worth the extra few bucks,positive,41,25-50,238,<500
This place was alright if you needed a quick and semi cheaper breakfast place Wife and I ended up getting a chocolate croissant and a ham and cheese croissant with a coffee and a latte My ham and cheese croissant was warmed up and pretty good Came with a coffee so it was about 10 bucks with their meal deal The wifes chocolate croissant was pretty good too but to me I feel like you could save a dollar and get a similar one from starbucks That and the latte was like another 8 bucks or so I wanted to try more things but I already lost a bunch of money playing craps that morning so had to cut my loses Ill have to go back since that monkey bread was calling my name,positive,134,100-150,680,500-1000
LOOK AWAY JUST SAVE YOUR MONEY This place is NOT worth trying 750 down the drain just like that One bite in I had tears streaming down my face My wallet was crying too JUST KIDDING But it was that bad The consistency and taste was not up to par If I were ever in New York I would not make a stop at Milk Bar,negative,66,50-75,320,<500

We LOVE AmÃlies On our 24 hour visit to Charlotte we ate there twice and took 32 worth of to go treats That said this afternoon they disappointed me I asked for a large cup of tea for my long drive home which I had gotten without a problem this AM at the other location and they refused to put it in a large cup I wouldve paid more for the bigger cup even though it probably wouldnt have cost them anything I asked several different people for the additional water and no one could make it happen even though they had a larger cup on the counter While the treats were wonderful the service left a bad taste in my mouth,negative,122,100-150,635,500-1000
Long lines for overpriced gross tasting belowaverage food that taste just like Panera I asked for my sandwich to be wrapped in lettuce keeping it healthy but they never heard of that before they told me so I was given a plate of unwashed field greens with a slice of slimy deli turkey thrown on top Not to mention I asked for the vinaigrette dressing and they literally gave me half a tablespoon fullmy husband commented that it looked as if they reused it from another customer They were out of all the featured sides as well Grossness Does not even begin to cover the nasty tasting food Yuck I left hungry My husband had the Brie and roast beef sandwich He said the one tiny slice of Brie was good there was 1 slice of roast beef in the sandwich which did not even cover the length of the bread He said he would never go back also The desserts did not taste fresh either Overpriced food which tastes disgusting Terrible service long lines I am not a fan of Panera but I would take Panera a thousand times over this crappy junky place,negative,195,150-200,1064,1000-1500
GET YOUR WIFI TOGETHER Coffee shops and bakeries are where most people like myself like to go to get away from home or the office to plug in and get things done Its frustrating spending 20 for a coffee and pastries to only realize you cant connect to the wifi As a business you should know your average daily customers and should adjust your wifi package and services accordingly Horrible customer experience,negative,72,50-75,422,<500
Maybe i am not fancy enough but it just tasted like a cupcake It was funny to order from an ATM I rank it low because it was expensive 450 each and not all that special they are also not big at all For the price i expected it to be a larger cupcake,negative,54,50-75,258,<500
The store has very limited products and is hard to find Croissants were very dry and hard like a rock They must have been sitting there at least 2 days You need a lot of water to swallow them very disappointed,negative,41,25-50,214,<500

Trendy delicious friendly  unique Thats it Thats the review Seriously The hype is real when it comes to Jenis Love the South End vibe  wanted ice cream after lunch  of course Jenis is the place to be Its usually packed but went around 3ish on a Monday and it wasnt busy as it usually is I strolled in no tasting of flavors no sitting inside but you can ask the friendly worker what flavors they recommend I went with Brambleberry Ooey Gooey butter cake  Almond brittle If I didnt have lunch I wouldve gotten more flavors to be honest Lol The flavors she offers are unique and delicious I have nothing negative to say about this place I always want to buy her ice cream in the store but its so expensive but I guess you gotta pay for quality I recommend you try Jenis either in store or at one of her many locations,positive,159,150-200,852,500-1000
We purchased two puppy and each of them is more than 50 dollars nobody tell us any thing before we made any payment when we opened the puppy in their store and checked if everything was ok and the other puppy was broken and we ask for a exchange they told us theres no exchange how ridiculous they are we just get this product one minutes ago and the employees who ever ran us up admitted that she never tell us that she explained their policy and she said that her fault but they didnt do anything and their manager who looks doesnt know anything and just tell me it not her fault and without doing anything useless Never go back to them because they have no service at all and their people just want the sale and push you out The most important is be aware to their quality,negative,150,100-150,791,500-1000
This place is nothing great than a regular bakery you find at the end of every street in america They have very limited selection of pastries and they tasted mediocre The cup cakes werent perfectly iced and they were sliding  Not a big fan of their workoverpriced and over hyped,negative,51,50-75,282,<500

My sister ordered a key lime cake for my birthday celebration The person who helped us when we picked up the cake was so lovely and the location is a cute kind of cottage core style place The cake was denser tha I had anticipated and had a more shortbread or pound cake thickness Lime curd was tasty All around good cake but would prefer to try something else next time Would give a 45 if I could,positive,78,75-100,404,<500

I love Buddy and his family oriented bakery  TV Show Cake Boss so naturally I had to go out of my way and stand in a long obnoxious line to get a taste of his pastries After doing my homework by reading tons of reviews  browsing through pics I came to the conclusion that the only item worth trying would be their Lobster Tail I was right Their cookiesbiscotti were basic and insanely overpriced at around 17 a pound The Lobster Tail pastry alone cost 6 for one so I was good with that The exterior shell was so crispy as in crunchy not flaky like a croissant but more like it had a nice crunchy bite to it which I loved Filling consisted of a mixture of Custard Whipped Cream and Baileys Irish Cream Irish whiskey and cream based liqueur It was divine Tasted better the following day when the Baileys flavor was more developed and pronounced Great stuff Hope an LA location is on its way,positive,170,150-200,916,500-1000

I was soooooo excited to try this place after hearing rave reviews about it but boy was I disappointed My bestie and I shared the cereal milk soft serve with Frosted Flakes bc hello You cant go wrong with anything cerealmilk because cereal milk is bomb Well apparently you can The soft serve wasnt smooth and it was incredibly salty Somehow the Frosted Flakes made it even saltier I thought we had a bad batch but after reading some of these reviews I realize thats the norm We literally tossed it after one bite and it was 7 We pretty much paid 7 for a cute SnapchatIG story Thanks I guess,negative,111,100-150,612,500-1000
Its not the bakery that I go for even though their Eclairs and Macaroons are the closes thing to heaven Its the 24 hour availability the delicious sandwiches and coffee drinks and the free wifi This is a great place to kick back and get some reading done or just people watch Also a great place to take visitors Theyre impressed overtime,positive,62,50-75,347,<500

These arent awful donuts but they certainly arent the best Ive tried their donuts on three different occasions and each time was a lackluster experience Dry donuts describes it best,negative,30,25-50,189,<500
I used to love this place but lately they have gone down on quality and quantity and increased prices I can understand post covid a lot of businesses have to increase prices But Handels has not only increased prices but also reduced the size of scoop by more than half and there are hardly any pistachios in the pistachio ice cream and chocolate chip cookie dough zero cookie dough and barely 12 almond pieces in chocolate almond Very disappointing experience,negative,80,75-100,465,<500
I was reading all the good review and finally try this place drive thru The guy who help was not helpful since it was may FirstimeI order 1 dozen and he fid not even ask me what Flavor I like he just decide for me and charging me 35 bucks so he gave me the special flavors and regular and the special flavors request punch in but different from the box dishonest person  The cheese cake was good My kids does not like itMy first and last to this donut placeNextime I just get winchells donuts ,negative,98,75-100,510,500-1000
After hearing about Milk  their looong lines in New York I was excited for it to open in Vegas at the Cosmo It finally opened in late December  I was able to see what the hype was all about We got a slice of the Crack Pie cereal milk soft serve with cornflake toppings  crack pie soft serve with cornflake toppings as well I spent 20 for these three items I also was confused about the toppings  thought the cornflakes already came with the soft serve but I was wrong However they were nice about it  didnt charge me 2 for the two toppings 1 per topping I tried my crack pie soft serve first My first bite was good with the salty cornflake topping mixed with the super sweet soft serve But after a few bites especially when I ate all the toppings already it wasnt that great It was also messy to eat since they overload the soft serve onto a mini cup so be prepared with extra napkins or wet ones I didnt even bother finishing my soft serve since it wasnt worth it anymore Next I tried their crack pie Ive read reviews on yelp about how good it is however when I took a bite I wasnt impressed There was nothing extraordinary or good about it It was cold  mushy It didnt taste like anything tbh I wish I could say Milk was amazingly good  too die for But I would be lying if I said it did It was disappointing Maybe the original location in New York is waaaay better than this one,negative,276,250-300,1430,1000-1500

Great place to get ice cream on an obscenely hotas most are in Phoenixevening Its a real change from all the boring selfserve froyo chains that make you do all the work and charge you 9 for toppings I really liked the retro atmosphere and despite it being a bit crowded on a Friday night the line moved pretty fast I ordered a Peanut Butter Freeze without knowing what to expect The end result A cup full of peanut butter chips crumbled up Reeses cups and chocolate all smooshed together in a creamy concoction Needless to say I nearly polished it off on the ride home One other thing I liked was the outdoor seating in the back but youd probably have to eat pretty fast considering the weather Seemed like a real hangout spot for all ages,positive,138,100-150,763,500-1000
First time at this donut shop and my kiddo and I loved it I had the French Toast Donut and it was delicious My daughter had the Caramel Crunch I think which she literally had to do a whole happydance about The weather was really nice today so we headed towards the back where you can exit towards a courtyard with outdoor eating and sitting areas We didnt notice the rooftop seating at the beginning or else we probably wouldve enjoyed our food there instead Overall this spot exceeded my expectations for a dont shop,positive,95,75-100,530,500-1000
My kids enjoyed the ice cream and I couldnt take the picture fast enough This is my second time here and I cant wait to try more flavors On this visit we had the hazelnut with Nutella and the strawberry cheesecake chunk both in waffle cones Well be definitely be back for more,positive,53,50-75,284,<500
What a freaking ripoff I didnt try Momofuku Milk Bar the last time I was in New York so I was excited to hear they opened one on the West Coast several months ago Ive seen photos of their soft serve all over Instagram for years now and I wanted to see why it was so special There were mixed reviews of the Vegas and New York locations across Yelp but I still decided to give it a try for the experience LocationAmbiance 55 Milk Bar is a cute ice cream stand with a pinkandwhite theme that fits nicely with the vibe of The Cosmopolitan Its located on the second floor of the hotel next to its Asian fusion restaurant counterpart Momofuku Service 55 Came at midnight on a Sunday night and there was no line The cashier warmly greeted us and offered generous samples without us having to ask We tried three of their soft serve offerings Cereal Milk w Corn Flakes Crack Pie and Cinnaswirl Soft Serve  Prices 25 The texture was nice and smooth it wasnt too runny or frozen They also give you a decent amount However I really did not like any of the soft serve flavors They were also each priced at a hefty 650 with tax for a single serving Yikes 1 Cereal Milk w Corn Flakes 15  The soft serve tasted like rotten milk I was trying to hide my disgusted expression while tasting it in front of the worker The Corn Flakes did the dessert no justice as it made everything weirdly salty and just not appetizing 2 Crack Pie 5  I honestly do not remember much of what this tasted like or how it differed from the Cereal Milk I just remember that I was not a fan 3 Cinnaswirl 35  The best of the bunch in my opinion as it resembled Cinnamon Toast Crunch I wasnt in love with the flavor after sampling this but I still ended up ordering it because I felt bad for spending so much time sampling I later wished I had just tipped the guy and walked away since the flavor became way too sweet after several bites I couldnt even finish it because my teeth felt coated with sugar and Im normally one to lick my bowls clean Try this place at your own discretion or for the experience but theres a reason for all of the Milk Bar locations averaged 3  35 star ratings,negative,417,300- 500,2237,2000+
Visiting here one time is enough The ice cream was creamy and tasty I got the double chocolate and peanut butter The price was high but I wouldnt have minded paying it if the service was better There was no line when I went I entered the ice cream shop and no one was there and no employees to be seen I thought they were closed at first After 5 minutes a girl finally came out She seemed put out that I wanted ice cream She was not friendly what so ever I will not be going back again,negative,99,75-100,500,<500
So many delicious options that its hard to choose You cant go to Vegas and not grab dessert at Carlos Bakery Service was friendly and efficient,positive,26,25-50,147,<500
Save your money I have heard rave reviews of Sprinkles cupcakes I also watched every episode of Cupcakes Wars which the creator of Sprinkles cupcakes judges now I think I will rethink her opinions I got the cinnamon cupcakeI use the term cupcake loosely since mine tasted more like a dense muffin Even if I poured milk directly on it I doubt it would be moist My friend ordered the vanilla cupcake with milk chocolate frosting also nothing to write home about Overall I was thoroughly disappointed since I LOVE sweets There are plenty of other local cupcake shops that I would choose over this chain If someone bought me another cupcake from Sprinkles I would try it in hopes of redeeming the name but I will not be spending my money on these MUFFINS again Sorry Sprinklesstep it up,negative,140,100-150,804,500-1000
Shocked how rude the owner treated me when I went to go get ice cream I arrived there at 855 and the owner came and told me to leave because they closed at 9 She had a lobby completely full of other people but decided to turn me down As she is closing the door on my face I asked her why I couldnt come in when it was only 855 and she rudely told me she was aware of that She sarcastically winked at me too Just plain rude You dont treat customers that way If you dont want to take new customers DURING your business hours then at least be nice about it Will NEVER go back here because of how rudely I was treated,negative,127,100-150,627,500-1000
Went for the first time today Was so excited until i tried the Cannoli The number one rule is that the WHOLE thing is filled with creme When i got into the middle of mine there was a big gap Not ok and your staff needs to be a little mature maybe higher older people,negative,55,50-75,272,<500
The flavors are great and the quality is high Friendly staff and loud music to distract long waits for the good stuff The smores sundae is something you need to try once warning you will gain 4 lbs instantly The Vietnamese coffee is out of this world,positive,47,25-50,257,<500

It wouldve been nice if 85 degree bakery opened in Vegas a decades ago around 2009 but since they waited too long between all my trips to california and back in my home country my excitement about this bakery already vanished by the time they opened one in Vegas I finally had a chance to walk in for the first time today why because when they first opened I always see theres a super long line I do not want to waste my time waiting so finally today I see theres no line and I decided to walk in and check it out whats the hype first of all they dont even carry the most popular and most common bread Buttermilk Boroh Bun I couldnt find it so I decided to ask someone who worked at the store I believe her name was Jasmine heres how our conversation goes Excuse me but do you before I could even finish my sentence she said Sorry but the tray will be out soon wow is she a mind reader or something except that wasnt even what I was going to ask her I was just going to ask her if they have buttermilk bun I did want to give her credit for apologizing though but geez we give you two month and this is the kind of customer service you provide to just brush off customer with some common answers anyway to my shock she doesnt even know what buttermilk bun is I was in shock all ASIAN baker should know what that bread is and just fyi no its not pineapple bunstupid name they used in jj bakery the right translation should be buttermilk bun So that does it for me the customer service just completely turned me off Im glad I only wasted 5 minutes of my time in there,negative,310,300- 500,1628,1500-2000
So the first thing Ill mention is that Villanis is very impressive from a pure food and execution perspective Compared to some of the other unbelievably overrated bakeries in Charlotte that focus on style over substance Amelies or just plain cant deliver good flavor for literally anything besides cakes Suarez Villanis delivers on multiple fronts Cheesecake muffins bagels and croissants have all been very strong here If you care about taste above all else its a good spot However 2 thing still knock it down a bit for me First is price Its about par for the market though so maybe Im a cheapskate The main issue though is that the people who work here are  profoundly and uncomfortably  unfriendly I am not the type of person who needs steamboat willy behind the counter as I worked in food service for almost a decade From the moment you walk in its pretty clear that the employees here wish youd never arrived I was hoping it was a oneoff the first time I walked in the store or even that it was just me but thats not the case Theres no consideration for how theyre packing anything either  the savory stuff is gonna get dumped in right next to a cheesecake pretty much Im sure if you ask for 2 boxes youll get an eye roll Maybe its part of what makes it authentically New York I wish there was a way to order online and have them leave my order out by the front door so I dont have to go in Such a bummer,negative,268,250-300,1459,1000-1500
Great place for family friends and everyone in between Definitely romantic Has a great view of the city The eclectic atmosphere is inviting and friendly Went with my boyfriend an his daughter We got two tarts a palmier and a pastry All AMAZING,positive,43,25-50,252,<500

Such a cute cafebakery Great place to hang out if you have some time to spare or if you want to do some work The napoleon pastry was delicious and the cream was very light The icing on the top of the napoleon was overly sweet for me but I enjoyed the puff pastry and cream The salted caramel brownie had a great toffee flavor but it was too sweet as well There were endless unique flavors of macaroons to choose from that it was hard to decide Overall loved the pastries,positive,92,75-100,481,<500
Ok it must get better over time I hope Grand opening and the place wasnt too packed Got my red velvet chai latte lemon meringue triple cinnamon and vanilla All were way too dry and lacked flavor with the exception of the lemon But still way to dry They mustve baked way too many and had them sit out way too long Thats what I get for going to their grand opening I just pray this isnt what to expect in the future as I will just stick to their ice cream,negative,92,75-100,476,<500
One of Charlottes greatest bakeries with an overall amazing experience Its different but beautiful Pastries are delicious and when youre craving something at the wierd hours of the night they are OPEN,positive,32,25-50,206,<500
Dont miss much about my country But when I occasionally do this the place I go A great blend of french taste and American humour Merci,positive,26,25-50,140,<500
This Bouchon Bakery is located right along the strip as you walk outside the Venetian Although tiny it offers some cozy seating outside where one can enjoy a nice cup of coffee I tried the kougi aman which made a delicious afternoon snack Will try the macaroons next time I visit,positive,51,50-75,284,<500
Kind of a cute place clever Simpson painting on the wall in the bathroom but wishing we left the donuts in there too Not tasty at all,negative,27,25-50,136,<500
This rating is for the rude service today My son always orders the same flavors each time but this time he wanted to try few different flavors before ordering They didnt care to give him any samples and wanted him to order his normal flavor Rushing us,negative,47,25-50,256,<500
So I came to Las Vegas to celebrate my best friends birthday and I decided to go and get her cake from here I thought she love strawberries so lets get a cake with some it or in it simple right  Nope not at all all the cakes that had strawberries were I lil off the strawberries looked old but I think maybe they just got a lil dryed out nope old as the Vegas stripmolded as well just gross a cake full of moldy strawberriesI am so displeased by this dont go here if u want a fresh cake ,negative,102,100-150,522,500-1000
We love this place They got great boba and you can also adjust the sugar level to your liking Ice cream looks delicious might try it next time But definitely recommend the Thai tea boba ,positive,36,25-50,191,<500
I adore Jarlings It is the embodiment of an old time ice cream shoppe I have gone here ever since I was a little kid My friends and I were so disappointed when the owners said they would be closing Jarlings We were begging our parents to go and buy ice cream when they announced they were selling all of their inventory Thank goodness for the new owners The ice cream and style of delivery has not changed which is a huge plus I didnt feel like ordering a snowstorm when I went because I had eaten a lot that day Do not let the sizes deceive you the smalls are pretty large I had a kid sized strawberry with cold fudge and peanuts on top That hit the spot The strawberry flavor is subtle The cold fudge is something that you have to try if you go to Jarlings For some reason it gives a different feeling than hot fudge It melds into the ice cream and becomes one with it giving a smooth finish to the sweet treat Some people may say that it is pricey for what you order But I would pay more for this quality ice cream because it is so refreshing Pro Tip Many people go to the window on the very right of the store and the line looks like it is out the door They think that you have to wait in line and then go to an open window This is not how it works There are 3 windows and 3 different lines In my experience the window on the very left is the shortest,positive,274,250-300,1384,1000-1500
I noticed a lot of pictures for the location in the Clock Tower on this listing This one is located on downstairs not the tower Walking in I noticed the display case right away and all of the goodies inside it When I saw they had Chocolate Almond Croissants I knew that would be my choice The price was marked 4 for the croissant and it was packaged togo for me Inside this location is smaller but there is some seating and tables right outside if you want to soak up some of the Strip air while you enjoy your fooddrink Later for dessert at home I heated up the Chocolate Almond Croissant and it was flaky and tasted good Id like to try the Apple Croissant next French pastries tarts macarons cupcakes and cookies as well sandwiches and salads that are made fresh each day are offered here on the menu Coffee teas and housemade juices are the beverages offered When on the Strip Id stop by again for sure,positive,171,150-200,930,500-1000
The Yelp rating brought us here The experience and the food will keep us away This place is definitely overrated and an absolute fraud of a french bakerycafe Entering the restaurant you feel a darkness that does not match the mood of Paris at all The hodgepodge of furniture and items meant to be eclectic parisian trinkets seem displaced in an undefined space that isnt warm and doesnt have ambience I was especially disappointed that the pastries which they should perfect as a core competency were truly disappointing Every croissant was crispy We ordered 6 Worst of all the option of spinach on the breakfast sandwichis actually dried frozen spinach The one good thing I had was a Layered Latte and it was delicious For that I give it a star Needless to say I wont be back but truly hope the owners of this place will have a real Parisian experience and revamp this attempt at offering one,negative,159,150-200,925,500-1000
With all the hype on how good the butter pecan icecream is we gave it a try It tasted just like cheap store bought icecream What a disappointment The cookie was the only item that tasted any good,negative,38,25-50,204,<500
Delicious and generous amounts scooped here They might be a little more expensive than Baskin Robbins but they are so much better A wide variety of flavors and seasonal ones to boot I decided to go with the snickerdoodle cookie and mint ice cream I am a huge fan of mint ice cream and this ice cream was not your average mint ice cream I could taste that it was made with fresh mint and it was delicious Cant wait to bring our friends here to try it out,positive,89,75-100,462,<500
Upon entry they tried to sell their signature dish which for 250 more than a single scoop got you a small cookie and a bite of cooked marshmallow No thanks Ordered a single scoop and it was about two bites worth Probably the smallest single I have ever seen Way overpriced for what you get,negative,55,50-75,298,<500
I stopped here yesterday after a show at the CLO Cabaret for some treats to take home and enjoy The girl working the shop was polite and efficient I ordered the peanut butter chunk cupcake cookie dough cupcake and two milk chocolate turtles The cupcakes were moist with a sweet icing but not too sweet light and fluffy cake texture and just overall delicious The turtles were huge and nearly twice the size of other chocolate shops on Pittsburgh they were crammed with pecans and lots of caramel Awesome shop in the heart of downtown and I look forward to returning soon,positive,102,100-150,579,500-1000
Cute little place Mainly ice cream mixtures instead boba or drinks Nice for the summer hangout Very casual laidback place,positive,20,<50,125,<500

I became skeptical of this place when I saw that the ice cream came in Chinese takeout cartons and came with a fortune cookie I tried 2 flavors and was out The ice cream was flatout not good,negative,38,25-50,193,<500
The milk ice cream and cereal flakes is of course a must get In addition I recommend getting the birthday cookie So good,positive,23,<50,124,<500
Amazing handmade ice cream in an awesomely eclectic location To top it off they are open till 1am on Friday and Saturday for those late night ice cream cravings With this being said it is not a question of wether I will be back but wether I will ever go back home,positive,52,50-75,268,<500
was looking forward to trying this place and finally made my way to downtown in the morning i got an assortment of donuts but every single donut I tried was dry dry dry this was during peak business hrs they really need to change the recipies because they are not up to par I kept hoping the next one would be better ended up throwing everything out they need to work on their glazing technique too looked like a bunch of 5 yr olds were in charge of that part of production very messy ,negative,95,75-100,496,<500
Wow wow wow and wow I had no idea ice cream could be this amazing They have a lot of unique flavors not because they want to be different but because they can make even the most esoteric flavors taste delicious Hands down my favorite is the toffee banoffee sundae The salted caramel drizzle alone is worth the trip It makes me want to grab the squeezeit bottle and suck on it like a baby Aside from the sundae my next favorite is the peaberry espresso ice cream Im not sure what a peaberry is but Im pretty sure its code for frickin delicious This is definitely the place to go to indulge yourself and impress your family or coworkers Funny tidbit my wife and I went here all the time while we were dating When I proposed I sent my wife on a scavenger hunt to all of our memorable and favorite places around the Valley The employees at Sweet Republic were gracious enough to help out and give my wife the last clue that directed her to the proposal spot Sweet Republic will always be a special place to us because of this Please open a location in Chandler or Tempe ,positive,204,200-250,1098,1000-1500

After spending 145 on a fondant cake that I probably couldve got 12 the price at another bakery and been more satisfied Im writing this review in hopes that they will fix whatever is going on down there Not only is the staff unprofessional but they are clearly uneducated I called in 4 different times to speak with someone on when the cake would be ready and also to make sure the special instructions were received  when you order online it doesnt allow you to type more than 78 characters good luck with that After finally getting through to someone he had to ask my name 3 different times and placed me on hold that many as well to go see the status of the cake I paid extra to have the lemon and raspberry filling which was good I wouldnt go above that Im giving this 2 stars because when your dealing with a business of this caliber you expect a little more greatness The day of picking the cake up I had to wait 35 mins with another gentleman just to get my cake That just seems unethical I dont know if its because they are understaffed or just the crowd situation due to poor planning of having guest wait in line I really hope more detail is payed attention to here in the future I definitely wont be ordering anymore birthday cakes from here for a while In my pictures youll see flour all over the fondant and cake from putting the bow on Also the icing layer to stick the fondant on the cake was so thick it took over the filling flavor and left you with a sweet piece of cake that you didnt want to finish We ended up just eating the center and throwing out the rest Buddy please visit this store and fix what is going on,negative,316,300- 500,1670,1500-2000
TLDR long lines at night for both sides no restroom 24hour ATM drinksclothes available awesome service Sprinkles Cupcakes and Ice Cream prides itself on maintaining its creativeminded and petloving culture and it shows The flavors rotate based on the days of the week but at 375 a pop some argue its not even worth it I very much enjoy my buy one get one free cupcakes and sometimes Ill splurge on one But theyre sooooo good I would avoid the black and whiteits just too bland compared to the rest This location has 4 seats but no restrooms and an evercrowded atmosphere The cupcakes are generally always fresh and the ice cream never with freezer burn If youre willing to invest in this expensive dessert I recommend getting an ice cream with cupcake topper Indulge your sweet tooth The service is always on point and you are welcomed with a smile most of the time You can purchase coffee milk water or apple juice and you can even take a mini cupcake home to your dog Their packaging is classic and theres always a sticker for every occasion If you have the time and energy to go to the inside of the LINQ I would recommend making the trip to try Sprinkles,positive,212,200-250,1199,1000-1500
Painfully slow service pointless to take a number Seems the system there is organized chaos Had the glasses dude mentioned in prior reviews scoffed and cackled at previous customer elderly as I was walking up Lived in Cleveland for 4 years service had been slow as molasseschaotic the 3 times Ive been here Not worth it,negative,56,50-75,333,<500
Pretty good location we were so happy it didnt have a line coming out the front door The ice cream flavors were awesomr so different than all the regular places,positive,30,25-50,165,<500
We stopped off at this cute cupcake shop on the way out the shopping area around the Linq and the High Roller We got a marshmallow filled chocolate tastes like an gourmet hostess cupcake and a black and white chocolate cake with white frosting and chocolate sprinkles They were both rich moist and amazing I didnt eat mine until we were back at the hotel and I was kicking myself we didnt get more Plus they have a 24 hour cupcake ATM which is just beyond cute,positive,87,75-100,475,<500
Wow the treats here were amazing It took my family and I a good 10 minutes to figure out what we wanted to eat I ended up with a waffle cone of Moosetracks ice cream and a scoop of brownie batter on top So delicious My dad got a tub of brownie batter and a chocolate dipped pretzel I really wanted to try one of the probably dozen flavors of cupcakes but it was hot out and ice cream won The staff was super friendly and the shop was clean,positive,90,75-100,448,<500
Ordered a cake for Thanksgiving to be delivered 3 DAYS PRIOR to our event and it still has not arrived 2 days AFTER said event Thanks Horrible customer service,negative,29,25-50,164,<500
Never got to taste the ice cream Waited in line behind one person for 5 minutes and left All they wanted was an ice cream cone Perhaps the employees should be focused on customers instead of talking among themselves And this was at 130 on a Sunday afternoon I can get bad service anywhere I wont be going back,negative,59,50-75,318,<500
On the Friday before Mothers Day I visited Sinful Sweets and bought a large box of assorted chocolate for my mother As she was eating some of the chocolate last evening she took a bite and noticed there was a long HAIR in one of the pieces The hair was not on top of the chocolate but actually embedded IN the piece meaning it had to have come there during the cooking process I stopped by the store and spoke with the what seemed the ownermanager very privately to avoid having customers overhear and to my surprise he did not even offer a refund nor try to do anything else someone in his position would be expected to do in this sort of situation So of course here I am on the bullhorn to hopefully warn at least some people about the customer service and more importantly lack of hygiene at Sinful Sweets,negative,153,150-200,819,500-1000
Today we visited Carlos Bakery in the Venitian There was a line out the bakery but we figured we would wait because we wanted to try it First the line moves fast then we got into the bakery and were right inside for at least 30 minutes There were only 3 people in front of us and it took way too long Everyone in line was upset and the employees were just taking their time and talking to each other It was so unprofessional and we will not be going back The employees needed to be quicker and more attentive to the guests It was a huge disappointment We waited in line for an hour at least and it should not have taken that long Not to mention the beer in buddys restaurant across the hall was 10 for one We are not happy customers ALSO when we left we were looking to see exactly how expensive everything was and realized that the cashier charged us for 2 cookies We only ordered one I know it was only a 2 cookie but still The whole thing sucked,negative,187,150-200,971,500-1000

I never knew Ice Cream could be so complex Through my childhood I was always used to eating the ice cream basics I never knew of the possibilities Some of the flavors at Sweet Republic are a little out there but still amazing I have always been pretty open to trying new weird or interesting foods but ice cream was always supposed to be a safe bet Lucky for me I know that if you want to have fun in life you have to take risks And so I did The strangest flavors I tried at Sweet Republic I did not expect to be good at all I think the two most surprising were the Bacon and the Jalapeno Avacodo which were strangely delicious My very favorites were Mayan Chocolate and Peach which surprisingly tasted good together My best memory at Sweet Republic was the eating contest which unfortunately I could not take part in because Im allergic to bananas but watching was almost as fun The service here is great they are so friendly and helpful to people who are new to ice cream exploration You can really tell that they are passionate about what they do,positive,198,150-200,1072,1000-1500
Masons is a great place to go if youre looking for unique flavor combinations and homemade ice cream The menu is constantly changing and they have vegan and dairyfree options My alltime favorite is the cardamom ice cream but today I opted for the pistachio over the French toast which I also sampled Prices are fair  2 scoops for 450 in a cup I would rate 5 stars except parking is super limited  Ohio City is a very popular neighborhood with small lots Try to get street parking nearby if you can,positive,94,75-100,512,500-1000
Its this Strawberry Cinnamon Toast Crunch Milk Shake from the good folks dayandnightnc Cereal Bar for me tho This is a Dope Black Owned Cereal Bar Milkshake concept that came across during my travels in Charlotte NCThey are doing some great things in that kitchen Hit them up if you are ever in the area they rock dayandnightnc,positive,58,50-75,334,<500
Guys maybe its just me But Im not a fan I dont get the hype Besides the service everything else ranged from underwhelming to not delicious Im not a fan of the cereal milk soft serve nor was anyone else in our group of five people The crack pie soft serve was not my jam either The bday truffles taste like a Starbucks cake pop without the fake chocolate coating Everything kinda tastes the same and its not a taste I want more of I feel a little dumb giving a place two stars because they dont like up with my taste butI cant be the only one right,negative,109,100-150,573,500-1000
Open 24 hrs Love all the pasteries and breads My favorites Lemon curd raspberry tart french style macaroons and their the eclairs the only thing they get wrong is the cofee As you get older and your tastebuds start to die like the rest of you you need a really good cup of cofee There cofee and espresso is week and they have no decaf espresso If that changes it would definately merrit 5 stars,positive,75,50-75,405,<500
I have always wanted a birthday cake from the famous carlos bakery We moved her just before my 40th bday I was so excited I told my mom and husband that is the cake i wanted a carlos bakery cake I showed him a picture from a visit before that I wanted He got me the beach cake I was so excited When he got home half the top of the decorations had slid off the top and down the side It looked horrible and my husband felt horrible But who cares lets dive into to the yummy cake Not The fondant peeled off the cake rather than through it when cut Tasted nasty and plain and hard The cake was barely tasteful to eat Never saw 1 part of the rave of carlos bakery cakes I have heard about forever We didnt even want to finish it we threw half of it away I would have rather had a 10 cake from the store rather than this nasty little runny cake for 50 I never want a cake or anything from carlos again,negative,184,150-200,921,500-1000

Heard a saying dont judge the book by its cover Very apt here this shop looks quite pretty but ice cream is not that good And the price they charge for such a mediocre ice cream is hard to justify Lastly staff here is not pleasant at all and dont have a bit of sense on how best to treat the customers Definitely skip this place unless you are in a mood for average ice cream with high price and bad customer service,negative,83,75-100,426,<500
Caffe Bene is a place I really want to like but I cant The menu is shockingly expensive it seems like most drinks start at above four dollars For the price they are charging youd expect amazing drinks but unfortunately that is not the case Ive tried the pearl milk tea which IIRC cost closer to 5 dollars and it was unfortunately too sweet and the pearl was still hard in the center I suspect it was not made from brewed tea but instead made from some kind of powder mix Ive also had the cafe mocha which was good but it wasnt worth the price Even though I think Caffe Bene is a poor value I still enjoy my visits there The decor is a nice switch from the other local coffeeshops with a nice modern twist on the coffeeshop concept This place is also brightly lit unlike some other places nearby Additionally the wifi is great and there are quite a few power plugs avalilable This is a place I think Ill return to when I need to study or get things done,negative,185,150-200,977,500-1000
3 bucks for a cone No sitting inside with AC Biting flies on the hot patio hmmmm not my idea of a good time in during August in Phoenix As for the Ice Cream Got the Strawberry Wasnt thick and rich Kinda thin milky and icy Not saying that is bad if it is the style you like But I like my ice cream thick and rich Ben and Jerrys style I dont really like Ice Milk I dunno I really wonder sometimes how places get rated so high Like they paid for reviews or something Because this place is not 5 stars,negative,103,100-150,517,500-1000

Cereal milk soft serve So good I think I could eat a pint by myself in one sitting Its not overly sweet with a delicious malt taste like the whoppers malted chocolate balls from my childhood Surprisingly refreshing for a soft serve Definitely get it with corn flake topping Wouldnt be the same without it Been wanting to try it in NY but glad to finally try it here,positive,69,50-75,374,<500
Pastries were fine It doesnt even matter because of the god awful service we received At first I thought maybe the guy behind the counter was trying to be funny because he was being such an obnoxious di He was not funny he was just an ass Everything he said other than  would you like a coffee was rude He swung the bag with my pastry on it as he gleefully skipped to the register He insulted How I ordered he insulted how I inserted my credit card and he got my order wrong Is this guy family Because he shouldnt be working anywhere near the public,negative,108,100-150,570,500-1000
The coconut sorbet is amazing and I dont even like coconut I cant wait to go back and eat more They have very unique flavor a that are hard to explain but I would recommend that you give it a try,positive,41,25-50,199,<500
Orange chocolate chip is the best from Babcock and brought to the Union One of the few treats left in life As far as outside the UnionBeautiful landscaping and inside great updates for the ice cream area Impressive was the beautiful Bucky by the lake You can now buy your ice cream outside also Very cool I especially was impressed by the Star Wars bar band music being played far away at the hoofers club,positive,75,50-75,416,<500
Ordered a 6 strawberry short cake for my friends birthday and he loved it My only and biggest issue about this bakery is their IRREGULAR BUSINESS HOURS this past weekend Since I was visiting from out of town I attempted to come through to order some of their infamous cannolis twice First time around was to pick up my preordered cake The security was telling everyone that the shop was closed even tho the workers were helping some customers inside If I didnt place a preorder I wouldnt have had the chance to get my friends cake I came back the next day hoping that theyd be back to their regular hours Sadly they havent been open for over an hour of their posted opening nor did they leave a sign of why It was just weird People did line up for more than an hour in hopes to get goodies and they did  after being in line for over two hours I couldnt do what they did coz I needed to be on the road back home Itd be nice to try their other baked goods in the future but thats only if they open during their posted business hours,negative,202,200-250,1060,1000-1500
Stopped by here for a snack after making a deposit into the Megabucks machine Figured that I deserved something after winning absolutely nothing Anyways took me a minute to finally find the place and it is true that they do not any places to sit Scanned the display case and everything looked pretty good Decided on a carrot cake cookie sandwich and a chocolate macaroon I am not a big macaroon fan but decided to try one of these because everyone says its the thing to get here Wellyeah still not a macaroon fan but it was alrite Carrot cake cookie sandwich on the other hand was mighty fine Next time I make another deposit into one of those one arm bandits I will make sure I have a lil something left to try out one of those Oreo looking things,positive,141,100-150,764,500-1000
Wanted to treat myself after a half marathon and this place was perfect for it It is in such a cool area near downtown we loved the outdoor seating area under the trees I had a doughnut stuffed with butter pecan ice cream and it was to me a perfect combination of flavors and textures it was truly delicious,positive,59,50-75,317,<500

Its not badbut it can be a lot better I was recommended to this place for some French bakery and small snacks I dont think I will comebacktheir service is really night though but if i want true French snacks for this price I can go somewhere else Setup and staff are very friendly though,negative,55,50-75,300,<500
Not the pastry they have the best products ever We love to go once in a while myself my wife and my two kids Its about the lady at the cash register I feel she just downgraded us every time we are there I think because my wife wears a muslim scarf she does not go the extra mile to help us like she does with every customer in the line Today again we had the same bad attitude towards us Thats why I decided to write this review I have more things to say but Ill stop here,negative,99,75-100,485,<500
A little backstory Im not an ice cream person Thats a strange thing to read probably because everyone loves ice cream But its true Ive gone months without eating ice cream gasps I remember eating gelato from a famous gelato place in Rome that was in Eat Pray Love and thinking it was OK maybe even overrated Initially I thought it was awesome but after some thought I had to wonder if it was the place that made it taste good  Rome being romantic beautiful and rich in history and all But Handels ice cream  I feel like I could eat blindfolded in some dark dank corner of the universe and still think it tastes great We Yelpdiscovered this ice cream place in San Diego and I almost fainted when I saw that we have it here in Vegas too With Handels Im finally excited about ice cream Im almost 40 so Ive tasted a lot of stuff and I know my sugar well Pretty sure Ive met my ice cream soulmate with Handels Im also at a point where I think that if I get love handles Love Handels from eating Handels I wouldnt hate myself for it Id be like OK Handels makes their ice cream fresh daily Which means it tastes fresh and heavenly Ive tried only a handful of flavors so far but judging by the flavors that Ive tried I feel like the Handels were very discerning in how they developed their flavors Their ice cream is delicious but never overpowering Their pistachio flavor which I want to try next should confirm this Because every pistachio ice cream out there literally tastes like some plasticky almond We shall see Love you Handels,positive,289,250-300,1600,1500-2000
Italian bakery with no cannoli  tiramisu What a disappointment No wonder theres no line waiting in front of the store anymore,negative,22,<50,130,<500

I havent found a decent ice cream in the Southwest since we left Wisconsin a year ago That all changed the moment we tried Handels this is literally the best stuff in all of Nevada I cant believe they dont have a location on the Strip yet but also yay for us locals we dont have to go to the Strip for this ice cream,positive,65,50-75,330,<500
The ice cream here is only so so They have rented out a huge place You cannot go inside You must place your order at a window that a woman opens There are NO restrooms NO place to sit Not customer friendly Maybe the business should relocate to a place that people can enjoy sitting down,negative,56,50-75,294,<500
A friend bought my boyfriend  I what I believe was The Blue Monster  First time trying ice cream from the company  we were really loving it UntilI went in for another bite  a long piece of hair came out Hard to see but zoom into picture its a white hair  I have Black hair so its definitely not mine I get it I work in the food industry  it happens Will definitely reconsider changing my review  rating whenever we do decide to take a trip thereAs long as I dont find another piece of hair,negative,102,100-150,513,500-1000
Honestly theyre just okay The last couple times Ive gotten them at the Cleveland zoo theyve had the taste of old oil I prefer the yeast donut to the fry cake donut which I find rather dry I appreciate they are different and topped instead of filled but I like the creaminess of a filled donut filling Their topped donuts need to hold their shape so it has the consistency of a buttercream frosting instead of a cream which I find disappointing They are never short on flavor options though so if youre looking for a variety they have it,negative,100,75-100,553,500-1000
Oui ou Non Ummm Non Amelies French Bakery is not quite une boulangerie franÃaise The pastries dont remind me of France or even Canada and I suspect its because of the use of margarine as a substitute for real full fat butter There isnt much bread to purchase which usually is a staple at a French bakery and everything taste a bit frozen I feel like taking an international flight just to get a delicious pineapple coconut cream cheese ring or a simple freshly made baguette The Pros The staff are the nicest people ever The shop stays open 24 hours which is rare in Charlotte The food is visually appealing The Cons The eating area is filthy which makes me nervous about the kitchen Seating is limited The decor is a tacky mix of the idea of what Paris should look like mixed with the local thrift store Overpriced for quality,negative,152,150-200,849,500-1000
Overpriced The wait is forever Dont order anything when you are in a hurry Bubble milk tea is not as good as CocoMero The only good thing is that they make it after you order it so you can adjust it by less sugar less ice etc as opposed to the premade milk tea at CocoMero which you cant ask for less sugar Besides that CocoMero serves better milk tea better taste with a similar price Pistachio macaroons are okay dont compare them to LadurÃe Other flavors are meh Staff is nice today,negative,93,75-100,513,500-1000
I was very excited when I heard about Amelieshoping Charlotte finally got a good Europeanstyle bakery So I went there a few days ago for lunch with a friend Was mesmerized by the display case of tarts eclairs croissants pains au chocolate and a few cakes The employee at the counter told us they also had lunch available so we decided to stay for lunch The sandwichesa roast beef sandwich and a Croquemonsieurwere good The CM actually was awesome But 2 sandwiches and 2 sodas cost around 17 if I remember correctly We got some sweets to goone large Napoleon and a chocolate croissant I I should have known by the dark brown color of the pastry that the Napoleon was over baked but I went ahead and got it And tasting it I knew that the pastry was definitely way overcooked and the filling could not overcome that overbaked flavor I suspect the baker must have been Prussian and didnt care for the namesake of this dessert because everything else in the case looked good The pain au chocolate which I saved for breakfast the next morning was good too I honestly am more of a cake person so I may go back to try one or two of the cakey items they have and the tarts look good too I left with an overall good impression any 24hour bakery gets high marks in my book The prices also seemed a bit high but perhaps I am just used to my local latino bakery where everything seems ridiculously cheap Definitely a good place to get something different and I will definitely go back,positive,274,250-300,1517,1500-2000
Had the Neapolitan and the mini cannoli Ive never heard of this place prior to coming to his place but the baked goods are pretty good Layers of the Neapolitan were still very crispy and the cannoli were very tasty,positive,40,25-50,219,<500
Im going to assume that most of the people posting are fairly inebriated when they write their reviews I had a chocolate marshmallow cupcake and I was seriously disappointed The chocolate flavor was lacking and the cupcake was somehow both dry and greasy at the same time It could just be the flavor combination I selected but Im sure there are far better cupcakes in Vegas I just know that I took one bite and didnt have another,negative,78,75-100,437,<500
I think I like Miette cupcakes more These were super hard and dry Though I had the flourless it was super dense I also ordered the lemon coconut and still dry The frosting was not soft and fluffy more like hard and overly sweet The place is pretty neat though One side is cupcakes only the other is ice cream  cupcake experience Basically you pick a cupcake and put ice cream on it Or you can have ice cream with cookies like an ice cream sandwich A bit pricy for me for two cupcakes around 750,negative,97,75-100,511,500-1000
Now that it is Fall give the seasonal flavors a try The pumpkin and pumpkin pecan are scrumptious,positive,18,<50,100,<500
I have to rate Sprinkles with 1 star I purchased a 4pack of cupcakes from them this past Saturday The first three were good but the fourth one was bad  my husband took a bite of it and pulled out a rather large piece of a rubber glove  rather disturbing and disgusting Makes me question their quality control and cleanliness I emailed Sprinkles about it and never heard back from anyone,negative,73,50-75,395,<500
This place symbolizes overrated businesses glamorized by the media for no justifiable reason The Lobster Tail people are raving about  It was completely stale with tasteless cream This is just a cream roll that you can get for cheaper and better in a Chinatown bakery Strawberry Shortcake  average Cream could have used more flavor and tasted less commercial and fattening Cookies  we tried one of each and none of them were good I literally took a bite and threw the rest away How is it possible to make cookies that arent good At this point you might think I sound like a negative snob and I attribute that to the amazing bakeries of San Francisco  so I apologize for having standards The icing to this cake was that we waited 1 hour to order  receive and most of the shelves were empty because they were selling faster than they could bake Im still mad over the stale lobster tail  especially for the price we paid Why would you come here,negative,176,150-200,968,500-1000
What a great place to grab dessert This place reminded me of something youd find in Chicago my hometown I had the smores sundae and all I can say is YUM Chocolate ice cream honey graham crackers seared marshmallow fluff etc what more could I have asked for My boyfriend had a brownie ala mode with hot fudge and the brownie was phenomenal I highly recommend this establishment if youre looking for a fun innovative dessert Added bonus they are open late,positive,82,75-100,476,<500

The only place I go to to get my matcha ice cream fix I freaking love this place So good And its such a cute atmosphere I love the matcha hojicha and the earl grey,positive,35,25-50,169,<500
I continue to awe at the amazing flavor quality of Jenis ice creams You can tell so much detail and care goes into each flavor Im so happy Charlotte has three locations with this one and NoDa being a bit bigger than Park Rd Shopping Center Literally any flavor you get is amazing I dont have a favorite because I love getting different flavors each visit  and thats easy to do because theres always new seasonal flavors coming out And can we talk about the drool worthy aroma that hits your nostrils as soon as you walk in I love the smell of freshly made waffle cones I love that you can also see them roll fresh ones behind the counter All of the locations are decorated with the same vibrancy  it makes for a great atmosphere This location has a good handful of seats inside and outside so you can beat the heat if youre lucky The fact that Jenis is always so welcoming to Yelpers is also another reason why I adore them so much They care about their customers and the products they offer them,positive,190,150-200,1023,1000-1500
I have always wanted to try this bakery and finally but the bullet last night I was not craving for cakes so I i tried the hazelnut cream puff and hazelnut lobster tail Unfortunately the cream puff was stale  so that was a downer However the lobster tail was good Not great Just good We didnt have to wait too long in line and was checked out less than 5 mins Two lobster tails and 1 cream puff cost us 16rounded up Would i come back Maybe for the cake But not for the ones i have gotten last night,negative,101,100-150,516,500-1000
I was pretty skeptical of going to Masons for ramen given that it is known for being an ice cream store and the fact that it is pretty hard to find good ramen places in Cleveland The shop has pretty limited seating with a few bar stools and small tables that fit 24 people so I would recommend getting there before the big lunch or dinner crowds My friends and I tried the tonkatsu and the chicken ramen and we were all pleasantly surprised at how good it was The broths were full of flavor there were a generous amount of noodles and toppings and the soft boiled eggs were runny and delicious I would have rated it higher but the charsiu portion I received was a small strip of meat that was mainly fat and some sections of the noodles were clumped together and overly chewy perhaps it was overcooked Overall though I think this is one of the better ramen experiences I have had in Cleveland and would come again,positive,172,150-200,934,500-1000
I realize this is an outlier of a review but I did reach out to Donut Bar via their website with no response Overall these are some good donuts I had the maple bacon cinnamon roll before we headed off to Death Valley and Northern California The first few bites were pretty amazing but things turned when I got closer to the center which by this time we were in Indian Springs The girlfriend thought it was a molten center but it just turned out that the center was COMPLETELY RAW Im not saying this was the contributing factor to some stomach problems I had for the following few days but exactly rule it out either The other thing is the kids donuts they have on Saturday And while they are cool they are really no different than those overiced heavily food colored donuts you can get at a supermarket,negative,150,100-150,819,500-1000
Got delivery via postmates Order arrived with missing half the order bc delivery driver said they were out of the apple fritters This is both a jack frost issue and postmate issue Restuarant should notify consumer and or the delivery service they dont have an item before showing up at your door with only half the order so that the order can be adjusted Only reason we ordered were for the apple fritters we added a few single donuts to make the delivery worth it Single donuts arrived and no fritters and still trying to get refunded What a joke,negative,100,75-100,555,500-1000
We ordered a chocolate cake for my nephews fortieth birthday celebration Even his 8 and 10 year olds couldnt eat it Never knew a cake could be so dry Icing was tasteless The cake was kind of cute with broken Oreos on top That was the only good part of the cake Not worth the additional 5 per person charge from our restaurant to cut it for us,negative,68,50-75,352,<500
I used to like their cookies but the quality and taste has declined tremendously This is the third time in a row Ive bought the cookies and it tastes stale and just doesnt taste good in general After all the hype this bakery has gotten the efforts arent there anymore Theres a reason why people raved about this place when it first opened but come on Youre going to lose your customers if your passion for baking doesnt reflect the results,negative,81,75-100,453,<500
Really good  tasty We had the Butter Pecan The only thing negative we could say about it is that the pecans were over roasted  tasted just shy of burnt We understand that this could be preference but since butter pecan is my absolute favorite ice cream Ive eaten plenty of it to know when the pecans were over roasted But overall it was still pretty good The guys behind the counter were very friendly  helpful The decor of the parlor was lively  bright Its not a cheap treat 2 scoops in a cup 450 3 scoops in a cup 550 but a nice indulgence especially with friends,positive,111,100-150,586,500-1000
We work in the area we often grab a quiche  soup  sandwich Little pricey but top quality We eat here at least once a week  call ahead for quick takeout,positive,33,25-50,161,<500
Hands down one of the best cafes Ive been to yet I came from east coast and was recommended to try out this place It was honestly life changing how fresh the breads were and I must say no other place on the east coast compares to this place The strawberry white chocolate bread was so fluffy and the filling was light nothing too overwhelming Just the right amount of sweetness My friend literally inhaled the pizza bread and I watched it disappear in 10 seconds Its safe to say he enjoyed the bread that much,positive,96,75-100,519,500-1000
This place has such great ice cream The menu is big enough that I can try something new every time I come Be careful if you have a nut allergy but it is nice that all the flavors are soft serve so there is no cross contamination from the scoops My friends and I keep coming back here Ill miss it when I graduate from Pitt,positive,66,50-75,328,<500
This is an update from my orginal post This is now my second time visiting Donutbar and unfortunately it will be mt last I totally understand the excitement about this location and how it reminds people of Voodoo Donuts from Portland but its not the same What makes Voodoo Donuts different from Donut Bar here in Las Vegas is that they never out They are continuously making their popular donuts for the people For example if Donutbar knows that their French Toast donut is only sold on the weekend then they should make enough due to its popularity In regards to their donuts they are super soft and fresh I truly enjoyed the split open strawberry donut because the strawberries are fresh and whipped cream is really smoothFresh  Light The strawberry cheesecake donut simply tastes like a strawberry jelly filled donut,negative,142,100-150,834,500-1000
Carlos bakery is my favorite bakery I had been dying to go to this place for the longest time The lines are always very long everytime I had gone And the place is pretty dang hard to find in the Venetian I had tried to figure out the best times to go as sometimes Id go on a Friday at noon and understandably they are packed I mean packed I mean a line like a ride at a theme park Today however ahhhh today was different Today was MY day Today was the day that I would get to eat baked goods from the great cake boss I decided who would go on a Wednesday at 4pm Boom Only a short line I looked for about 10 minutes and there was so many decisions These are big decisions Not life or death obviously But big in my mind SoI got the carrot cake and 2 red velvet cupcakes It came to about 15 which is expensive but also fair They put them in a nice little box so I could take it home and enjoy I dont have much else to say about the place It is well maintained clean and the people are friendly You can see the workers in the window working on the food Now how were the baked goods Delicious They were among my favorite for the red velvet cupcakes And the carrot cake was superb as well Like I  But like I said the lines can be crazy long and finding the place is quite a challenge So my advice go there and if the line is tooooooo long then come back another time Like say Wednesday around 4pm,positive,285,250-300,1434,1000-1500
It was me and my fiancÃs first time going to Las Vegas for New Years One of the first things were to definitely visit Carlos Bakery because we are big fans of the show We bought the Cannoli Bundle that came with 5 cannoli 4 regular and one chocolate cannoli We also bought the slice of red velvet cake We were so excited to finally try Carlos Cannolis but unfortunately it did not meet our expectations The cannoli filling had a weird texture We expected it to be light and tasteful It was heavy and not flavorful The red velvet cake also did not meet our expectations It did not taste great like we thought it would be Unfortunately the only good thing I can say about this place was the service Me and my fiancÃ were so sad because we love the show but it was a disappointment to us,negative,151,150-200,801,500-1000
I love Cake boss and have been watching it since season 1 so imagine my excitement when I see Carlos bakery on the strip  I ordered a creme puff for my son The creme inside the puff was oozing out but taste good  The puff on the other hand tasted stale The counters werent marked well neither looked cared for  Looked like people who work in the store had a price tag for their smiles too,negative,79,75-100,395,<500
Wonderful Wanted to find a nice local joint to have dessert and found this gem The staff were all very kind sweet courteousand the ice creamOHHH the ice cream I got the Toffe banaffee and it was heavenly My wife got the Campfire Smores and she said it was DEELISH The price is comparable to ANY CHAIN but the quality is BETTER I will agree with Natalie W this place IS BANGIN,positive,72,50-75,403,<500
Ive been here twice and both times have been bad experiences The first time I came the pastry I got was old and hard The second time I got a couple of pastries and shared them with a few other people and we all got food poisioning I dont know if the bakers arent being very clean when baking ie not washing hands or sneezingcoughing on baked goods or if certain ingredients arent being stored properly but something needs to be fixed,negative,82,75-100,448,<500
So many yummy flavors to choose from We both got the sundae which included 3 flavors a wet topping hot fudge caramel or marshmallow sauce and one dry topping candy or nuts plus whipped cream and a cherry for 995 each I really liked my flavors and would go back to try different flavors,positive,54,50-75,298,<500
The worst part about Mitchells is the long line usually starting as soon as you walk in the door The rotation of seasonal ice creams is a great feature and they work wether it be winter summer spring or fall Cone or cup will be the easiest decision you make once you hit that glads counter and see all the flavors your next road block will be one scoop or two,positive,71,50-75,368,<500

I have been dying to make a stop at Bouchon bakery one of five locations by the renowned Chef Thomas Keller This was checked off my wish list today The PALM SIZED macarons were yummy and had the perfect consistency The raspberry and caramel macarons were delightfully delicious and for coffee lovers the coffee macaron was on the strong side but I love my coffee black so I was a huge fan of it This cute little shop in the Venetian also has coffee wraps salads muffins and cinnamon rolls available Ill be back for seconds on macarons and to try the cinnamon roll,positive,104,100-150,577,500-1000
So excited when we asked then ordered based on the wall pic two Strike It Rich with carmel to replace the butterscotch and a third order What we got was two Gold Rush with syrup we think Rather replace it we got doubled teamed what we ordered was basically the same I guess hamburger cheeseburger basically the same For the cost of it should had been done correctly and replaced,negative,70,50-75,389,<500
I loved it They have so many different flavors There are even non dairy options also I wanted to try something new so I got the non traditional banana bread split Three scoops of ice cream and your choice or peanut butter or regular whip cream It was crunchy smooth and refreshing And then to make it better The spoon changes colors with cold temperature You bet I took that baby home to reuse Youll see me here petting all the doggos that visit and eating ice cream all summer,positive,90,75-100,490,<500
DONT buy your wedding cake here I ordered a cake here from Elizabeth the manager She was very nice I text her a picture of the cake A naked cake No flowers no fondant very little icing I wanted 4 layers for 150 people Yellow cake with Bailey cream filling with fresh berries filling She showed me the cake on display and said it would be that size I asked the price and she quoted me 650 I said OK I asked about delivery My venue was 27 miles away from the bakery She said they did not have a delivery truck but that the cake would have to be assembled at the venue So she decided that someone would indeed have to deliver and assemble it I asked what the charge would be and she said about 50 I agreed to that charge and said if it was more to give me a call I offered to pay in full but she said that would not be necessary I left assuming my order was set She never called me back so I assumed that there was no problem A WEEK before the wedding I called to give them my credit card number and long story short Elizabeth now says the price for the cake is now 1200  With a 200 delivery charge because one of their employees would have to use their own vehicle She said it was a very complex cake and that it required all kinds of complex construction She said she had called the office in Hoboken and they said thats what the charge is I said I would have to think about that since they had almost doubled the price AFTER I placed my order and had no time to shop for another cake I emailed the Hoboken bakery and they said they had forwarded my email to the Las Vegas bakery and that I would receive a call from them within 48 hours No one ever called So less than a week from the wedding I had to shop for a wedding cake again Fortunately the Monte Carlo Hotel came to my rescue and made the same cake but bigger for 650 and delivered it free Guess Carlos Bakery is such a big name that they dont care about my business or their reputation as a new bakery in this town Very very disappointed,negative,401,300- 500,2051,2000+
My original review of this place is below which I wrote while I was sitting in the bakery I had given it 4 stars and some really nice comments but felt I should update it after the rest of my experience here Ive truly never had such an upsetting experience at any business in my life In the review I had said the worker was seemingly condescending implying that her attitude might not have been intentional and trying to give her the benefit of the doubt while she was rolling her eyes at me while I decided between the desserts She had read my review while I was in the bakery which is fine although she pointed out how obvious it was that I was writing it as if I was trying to hide it She brought my coffee to me and said Here you go Jasmine making a point that she had seen my review as I hadnt told her my name and didnt use a card to pay She went back to the counter and got on her phone About ten minutes later two of her friends came in went to the counter and began quoting my review out loud while saying things like how dumb is this person its actually hilarious The girl working said like I actually want to show them this review we literally do not care what people say on Yelp like I should frame that and hang it up here Which is interesting because Im pretty sure reviews are for other possible guests not to hurt some 20 year old workers feelings They continued to talk about about me loud and clear enough so I could hear them from the other side of the room saying We came down here as fast as we could when we saw this I read it on the way down it actually made me laugh Is that her right there Ohh my I could tell she was writing it like its so obvious when people are doing it After 15 minutes of this I went up to the girl and said Okay as you clearly want since youve been standing up here intentionally talking about me Im leaving Just so you understand that review was not written as a personal jab at you it was written to help other customers and the business which is why I gave it 4 stars I intentionally didnt use a description of you or gender because I didnt want to pinpoint a certain person As I said this the three of them were mimicking my body language and chuckling to themselvesit was like watching 7th graders interact on a playground As I walked out the door the girl yelled its okay guys some people are just miserable So I guess by giving a business 4 stars and an honest review Im a miserable person which by this point yeah I probably was I also thought it was interesting that she was figuring out I was the one that wrote the reviewif I was trying to hide who I was I probably wouldnt have gone around taking pictures and wrote the review while I was sitting there I work in a restaurant myself I do my best to be an understanding and friendly customer I know how it feels when a customer upsets you I just cant believe anyone would think its okay to treat any person like this let alone when theyre representing a business I had sent texts out to my friends and family telling them to try this place at first but naturally Ive taken that back Enjoy reading this review you dont care about darling ORIGINAL REVIEW Nice atmosphere decent espresso drinks DELICIOUS desserts Cozy relaxed Victorian style atmosphere that makes you feel right at home Seems to usually be about 6 deserts at a time with vegan options as well I had a slice of salted caramel chocolate cake that was so big and rich I had to take some home Limited espresso menuno flavors or milk options but my cappuccino was made well My only complaint was the person working at the time wasnt the most friendly person in the worldnot sure if they were the owner or just a worker but they definitely didnt seem happy to have a new customer as they were short and seemingly condescending Kind of a turnoff but the place is so nice in itself I will most likely return,negative,750,500+,4001,2000+

Okay so the first time Ive ever heard of Sprinkles is when it opened in Las Vegas I know I know Im deprived or whatever youd like to call it Anyways I went to the Linq with two of my friends with the intention of trying Sprinkles for the first time Whenever I go to a popular cupcake place if they have red velvet  then that will be the flavor Ill be trying It also helps that people rave about it First off they kind of have a schedule of flavors for the cupcakes Certain flavors of cupcakes are only available certain days of the week There are a few however that are available all the time which includes their red velvet and vanilla I believe So if theres a certain flavor you want to try make sure to check their schedule Each cupcake is 375 which seems normal kind of for one of these popular cupcakeries Whats great is that they even have a mini cupcake treat available for you to buy for your dog for 250 My friend actually bought one for her doggie  Awwww Also love the fact that the plate they give you and the forkknife are all wooden Its cute and ecofriendly When I first took a bite of the red velvet Ill admit  it wasnt heaven BUT it was really good The cake was really moist and flavorful The frosting was really sweet and heavy but that is what you expect from a cream cheese frosting Sprinkles is probably one of the few places that could make a red velvet cupcake correctly Ive tried a lot of different ones and not all are as moist as Sprinkles so yay Now Im a little interested in how their Strawberry cupcake tastes like I had considered getting one but  I wasnt sure if I could finish it or if my friends wanted to help me finish it boooo They also have a Cupcake ATM outside From what I heard its supposed to be 24 hours You can order their cupcakes andor cookies from it However the prices of the cupcakes from what I noticed is about 50 cents more expensive I guess because its 24 hours Or the novelty of it If it werent for the fact that its on the strip I would go to Sprinkles more often Alas for me its not worth the trouble,positive,405,300- 500,2149,2000+
Made it in about 30 minutes before close and after waiting 20 minutes for the line to clear we arrive at the counter only to hear they are not making any of the things we wanted Disappointed we left Why staff your place with one person to close on a Friday night The lone girl working had such great vibe and smile so this rating has nothing to do with her or the yummy looking desserts,negative,76,75-100,394,<500
Amazing bakery I got the chocolate croissant and it was delicious The chocolate bouchons were amazing I came here two days in a row because of how much I liked it They have sandwich options in a baguette or a croissant The line goes by quick and the prices are very reasonable for the quality Service is great and quick Highly recommend this bakery,positive,64,50-75,356,<500
This is a great little joint We stopped in here with some friends on a whim shortly before closing time but they still had all the flavors out and the staff was very nice despite it being a few minutes before close They were very nice about letting us try a few different flavors before ordering I finally decided on the salted caramel which was excellent My husband got the guiness chocolate and we another friend got the cinnamon We all tried the bacon ice cream which was very unique and not bad at all I tried the blue cheese ice cream and while it was good Im not sure I could do a whole scoop of it They had some wonderful looking ice cream sandwiches with big cookies that I would like to try next time I will definitely stop by here again,positive,144,100-150,758,500-1000

The strawberry shortcake was delicious The customer service was awful I waited in line for over ten minutes before reaching the counter and was promptly ignored by the cashier when attempting to pick up my online order When I finally got sick of waiting and handed her my confirmation for my order she didnt even say a word just handed off the paper to another employee Though we enjoyed the cake we will not be back The staff didnt even offer a greeting to any of their customers upon walking in or wish them well when they were leaving,negative,99,75-100,548,500-1000
This place is awesome First come first serve so come early They have plenty of vegan options and they change the flavors all the time Donuts were fresh and delicious Highly recommend,positive,32,25-50,187,<500

Amazingly BAD we as many people went to Vegas to get married and when I found out we were staying at The Venetian and they has a Carlos Bakery there I called to get a small wedding cake ordered I asked for a small round cake all white possibly a little pink and was told no problem they just need 24 hours so if we have time just come into the bakery when we arrive and we can work with them directly We did just this and when we arrived were tole the best they could do is a week maybe 3 days or we could pick something out of the case We asked to see the manager and were told they were not there So we got stuck with an ugly cake with a brown bow and orange and green dots They asked if we wanted anything written on it we said sure Congratulations and our names on the cake and they used blood red and it ran down the side of the cake looking like it was bleeding When we did serve the cake we had nothing but snickers from our friends the fontdant was so driy it cracked and fell off and the cake was dense and dryer than a pound cake Basically ir was a bad cake from a bakery that just didnt care about the product it put out When we called to complain no one ever called back We emailed them and after several days got a vague email saying sorry send me a copy of your receipt Then over a week later got another email saying sorry next time your in Vegas you can have 10 off anything in the store BIG THANKS ruin my wedding and toss me a pathetic 10 off I SAY PASS THIS BY AND GET YOUR SWEETS FOR HOSTESS THEY WILL BE BETTER,negative,315,300- 500,1547,1500-2000
I can understand this place is hyped up because the guy has his own show etc But the ordering and payment process is ridiculous So unorganized Even if your items are boxed and ready to go theres a 5 minute wait at least to pay 10 for a mini cheesecake Meh There are much better places to go on the strip Save your time and money,negative,66,50-75,344,<500
Ive always liked Amelies pastries and had been many times before so when it came time to plan my sisters bridal party I ordered a couple of trays ahead to pick up the morning of the brunch The manager who took my order was very polite and helpful When I arrived however  half an hour after the time I was promised theyd be ready  the sandwiches evidently werent even prepared When I pointed out that Id been promised trays not bags the reply was that Nobody told them that though everything was fixed I was disappointed In the extra trouble in an already stressful wedding weekend,negative,108,100-150,601,500-1000
I love love love Sprinkles Cupcakes So glad they came to Vegas Great staff clean space and quick service what else could you ask for One thing I did notice people complaining about was that there isnt much seating but then again how long should I take you to actually eat a cupcake even when youre taking your sweet time Very flavorful and moist cupcakes with great options everyday,positive,69,50-75,393,<500
The cupcake trend is gone but this chain is still going strong and just opened at The Linq Thought Id try a place recommended by quite a few SoCal Yelpers Did not expect to be as disappointed as I was Tiny space leaves little room for a line menu is large and not easy to read at a distance save for the list of flavors and cute colorful caketopper symbols indicating which flavors are currently available Service is a trainwreck Even busy this place doesnt need 6 people behind the counter their ordering and fulfillment process makes no sense Made it to counter placed order for one single dark chocolate cupcake plated to eat on location My name was taken and I was told someone would be with me in a minute Im not sure why the same guy couldnt just reach into the case next to us and hand me the cupcake Paying for my order was hectic Girl misprounced my name to get my attention gave me correct flavor on a plate with no fork After handing me plate asked for my card Awkwardly set it down retrieved card then had to reach again for my ID for a four dollar purchase after waiting nearly 10 minutes Really Finally snagged a seat to eat Cupcake frosting was good Cake itself was dry Just because I ordered at 9PM should make no difference to the quality of your product Cake texture and frosting texture didnt really work well together due to the extreme dryness of the cake and the hardened frosting topping Opted for a cake without sprinkles wanting to get the cute circle symbol instead When I ate it I nearly chipped a tooth Given the low quality cupcake received dining in while they were still open and busy Im hesitant to try the cupcake ATM Cant imagine they retain their moisture well in what must essentially be a refrigerator Sprinkles you have a great brand and clever marketing facilitating your business in an amazing new and highlytrafficked area Step up your game in the kitchen and train your employees on efficiency,negative,354,300- 500,1989,1500-2000
Holy Moly  I went here twice in five days My family first came here during lunch time and convinced me that I needed to eat ice cream before dinner still cant decide if that was a bad or good idea We each got the miniature cones with one heaping scoop of ice cream Dont try to walk around eating this ice cream because you will get it all over your hand and face and look ridiculous You should just sit down for the 10 minutes it takes to eat the ice cream and enjoy the people watching If you need to use the restroom there are keys to let you in,positive,112,100-150,560,500-1000
I dont know how this didnt get 5 stars every time The salted Carmel is unreal Its a very throw back type ice cream parlor My fiance and I got our engagement pictures taken here due to the decor Helen the owner is super nice and they always have new flavors Unfortunately Im a creature of habit and always get the same thing salted butter Carmel and chocolate in a cup It is a touch pricey but you get what you pay for Also whole foods carries SR in their store so that is a def plus We love this place,positive,101,100-150,516,500-1000
I thought CJs was up there until I tried this ice cream This is less showy and more straight forward The flavors were delicious and the texture was almost like soft serve ice cream I got the 2 scoop waffle cone with Blueberry Cobbler and the Graham Central Station They went perfectly together,positive,53,50-75,299,<500
Back in the Ninetys I had a doughnut from here Went to the store all they had was a jelly doughnut People were buying dozens of these Not kidding  who only sells one kind a doughnut  123 dozen at a time in fact As fast as they were being made they were sold It was good like Krispy Creme smaller not icing covered Now they have regular size doughnuts with fancy toppings Memmh theyre decent but not as good as the hype These are good dont get my wrong its the hype over them thats over blown Thats just my opinion so tryem for yourself ,negative,108,100-150,566,500-1000

Yes yes yes If I could live here I would I recommend the medium size bag that you can fill your own with a smorgasbord of flavor options If you are watching your waistline go for the mini chocolates because you can eat more of them and not feel guilty ,positive,51,50-75,260,<500

YUMMMY Its a close race between here and the place in Memorial Union but I have to go with this one in the end I often have sudden cravings for the Zanzibar chocolate and actively avoid walking through State Street on the way home just so Im not tempted to walk in only this once then Ill stop for an entire month CHA RIGHT,positive,64,50-75,341,<500

I have been enjoying Hopscotch baked goods since their Art Mart days and have had plenty of great experiences Unfortunately the order this review is based on will be our last from this bakery due both to the quality of the cake and the awful customer service I experienced I placed a custom order of a cake and 3 dozen cupcakes for my dads 50th birthday party in May which they estimated would feed around 60 people This order cost 230 for price reference At the end of the night we had all but 7 cupcakes and 1 slice of cake left due to the fact that the cake was almost inedible The cake was supposed to be camouflage  Im not sure if the bakery was confused on the coloring or if they were just too busy to care I was told on two occasions that they had several wedding orders they were working on as well but what we ended up with was three of the ugliest shades of green swirled together on the cake and two shades of green dotted onto the cupcakes My dad did not even know it was supposed to be camoflage and likely wouldnt have known it tied into the theme at all if I hadnt purchased duck toppers for it The cake was dense very dry and reminded me more of weekold muffins or scones than chocolate cake I had requested 3 flavors of cupcakes but only received two lemon and some variation of vanilla we believe  neither had much if any flavor What was supposed to be buttercream icing was completely void of flavor and the texture was far too fluffy  Im talking airy flavorless goop  and ugly goop at that I tried a cupcake first and asked several close friends to taste as well thinking my palate might have just been confused that night The consensus was much the same  the cake was dry had likely been either overcooked andor frozen for too long and not properly thawed and neither the cake nor the icing had any flavor at all I was so embarrassed we just skipped dessert all together and I boxed up the cake to return to the bakery I placed 4 calls to the bakery that next week I believe all were answered by the same woman at the front counter who relayed 3 separate stories about why the owner had not been in contact with me not in today has been on vacation isnt in until this afternoon but she insisted the owner would receive the message and call me back She never did To this day I have not received a phone call or apology I happened to be reviewing my bank account and saw a full refund for my order a week after my first call to the bakery While I am thankful for the refund it just doesnt excuse the awful service and terrible quality of the cake We have thankfully found a fantastic baker in Effingham to use instead for our upcoming wedding and wedding festivities as Hopscotch was going to be our bakery of choice If you are considering Hopscotch and are looking for good quality tasty baked goods I would sincerely suggest you keep looking,negative,549,500+,2926,2000+

I went to the new Milk in Vegas after hearing the hype and I must say it wasnt worth it at all I got the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes and it didnt taste like anything at all I ate the whole thing and felt like I ate a cone of air There was zero flavor  you could hardly call that cereal milk I also sampled the sweet potato pie soft serve and while it had a lot of flavor it didnt exactly taste like sweet potato pie There was something a little off about it The only thing it was good for was a cute photo of the ice cream in front of the neon sign Milk is definitely all hype overpriced and not worth it,negative,130,100-150,632,500-1000
Waaay understaffed Employees dont talk to customers Only 3 employees and 1 in the back  while the other 2 are moving slowly Very frustrating Everyone in line complaining At least if employees hustled to speedup line and make cutomers feel like their hurrying and trying their best But its like they they dont have a care in the world they just take their time as if theres only one person to serve and not 20 Annoyed the entire time,negative,80,75-100,445,<500
Really good customer service Everything is made fresh and is realllllly yummy The only complaint is that these donuts wont last more than a day After the first day the donut bread gets hard and stale and for the price they charge i feel like they should last longer Still really worth it if youre gonna get one or two and eat them the same day,positive,66,50-75,351,<500
Worst experience at a Ghirardelli ever As I was waiting for my order we seen some roaches crawling under the tables and on the walls I quietly mentioned it to one of the workers because I have seen other people explode in a store after seeing a roach and was trying to avoid that for them He told every co worker there and they all started laughing After he went to kill it he walked away and mocked me saying OMG theres roaches as if theyre gonna hurt anybody Did not even finish the ice cream I was disgusted by the service,negative,102,100-150,535,500-1000
Have stayed at the Venetian twice three nights each time within the past four years Both times we had breakfast each day at Bouchon at The Clocktower We always would get a latte and a kouign amann They were absolutely delicious Like a croissant but with layers of sugar spread throughout The sugar caramelizes during the baking Two medium lattes and two pastries was about 20 per day Well worth it in my opinion I actually came home and looked up recipes for this pastry I made them for my husbands birthday Very timeconsuming,positive,94,75-100,545,500-1000
Arrived to find none of the staff behind the counter were wearing any type of protection  no mask  gloves  nothing  No thanks After my post I received a negative email from management there I assume arguing with me Sounded like it was written by a 3rd grader Absolutely no interest I going back No regard for the safety of their clients at all,negative,67,50-75,354,<500
1010 bakery vibes food and service I came here on a Monday during the day and it was very relaxing and not too busy The service was amazing I was stuck between what pastry to get and the woman patiently walked me through her favorites and helped me choose one I ended up getting the espresso entrement see pictures which she recommended and it was delicious It also looked so cool as a bubble kind of pastry and seemed too pretty to eat The inside was huge it had a lot of seating and the decor was nice to look at I worked from here and it had a nice and relaxing vibe definitely recommend checking it out,positive,118,100-150,621,500-1000
Waited in line for over 25 minutes The one girl working made a crepe maybe every 6 minutes with at least four text messages and three coffee breaks between each one People literally got out of line I would have too if I didnt just have my wisdom teeth out and need soft food Horrible service,negative,56,50-75,298,<500
This is a great bakery when it comes to their baked goods Unfortunately their service leaves a lot to be desired One usually comes to places like this to relax but the two ladies behind the counter were apathetic at best and did not care how they packaged the goods before giving them to the customer This experience takes away so much from the food,negative,65,50-75,355,<500
I was visiting a friend nearby and got a serious craving for ice cream Of course I turned to Yelp for suggestions on where to go as I was not familiar with that neighborhood Fatty Daddys came up and as soon as I saw that toasted marshmallow in pictures I was sold I grabbed my bag and run out of the house and headed to fatty Daddys The parlor is small but very cozy with tables and chairs that I can accommodate from a small group or push together for a bigger group They have a pretty good selection of ice creams the most unique I saw was mango habanero The lady behind the counter indulged my desire to sample the different flavors I got a double scoop of the mango habanero for my sister because she loves ice cream and she loves spice I didnt tell her what it was but when she tasted it the look on her face said everything She loved it For myself I chose the Irish whiskey cream flavor You could really taste the flavor of the whiskey without it actually being alcoholic I got a double scoop with the toasted marshmallow on top It was fun to watch praise the blowtorch to get the candy toasted and it tasted amazing My only critique was that the ice creams were not as creamy as I had hoped they would be and the banana flavor they have is not as sweet as I expected Otherwise this place is pretty legit and I would probably go back another time,positive,263,250-300,1374,1000-1500
Terrible Got a Thai tea smoothie for close to six bucks and it was the worst thai tea flavored thing Ive ever tasted just straight up tasted like milk Friend got a milk tea latte and it was half powder not mixed properly They dont even try it seems Another friend got gelato which tasted like frozen sugar water and nothing like pomegranate also ridiculous expensive for small portion I have yet to hear anything good on their menu but especially stay away from thai tea milk tea red velvet any gelato,negative,92,75-100,516,500-1000
This is a must visit ice cream shop There is a constant rotation of new and unique ice cream flavors and their dough melts are heavenly with the perfect balance of doughnut fluffiness but dense enough to hold the ice cream I go there every time Im in the area,positive,50,25-50,262,<500
Mmmmm Ice cream sandwich This dessert is really great because its really two desserts I like that a lot So I went here this afternoon for dinner and got the Vietnamese coffee ice cream between two chocolate chip cookies so good It was a little salty and sweet and coffee y what more could I ask for The BF got peanut butter ice cream with snickerdoodles also very very tasty The thing is the ice cream wasnt blow your mind awesome and the flavors were pretty ho hum I would definitely come back here if I were in the neighborhood but I probably wouldnt make a special trip again,positive,109,100-150,611,500-1000
WARNING This place must no longer be what the pictures and other reviews are saying Melt is now just a rolling cart stand at this address The ice cream flavors were super limited They didnt offer any toppings other than their signature fortune cookie I have to say the ice cream wasnt horrible just far off from what I was expecting based on the other reviews and pictures,negative,68,50-75,382,<500
I really dont get the hype I love donuts and was extremely dissapointed with what I found here The donuts my friend and I got were heavy with soaked up grease overly sweet and too rich to think of finishing If thats your cup of tea then enjoy it before your early grave Just no I realize donuts are supposed to be an indulgence but I like a little subtlety with my calorie rich foods The Sunlike density of the calories in this donut were literally obvious from just picking up one of these hunks of edible lead,negative,98,75-100,526,500-1000

So 200 plus reviews later not sure anything else can addbut here we go anyway I am just about positive am the last yelper that I know in Vegas that finally checked out Donut Bar I noticed recently Donut Bar has started to open maybe once month or random times at night So was like NICE finally get to try the pop tart and the creme brÃlÃe All the videos seen of the creme brÃlÃe and one of the stables pop tart looked delicious I do love my donuts from time to time I heard that generally there a line when first open and the earlier get here the better The later you come not really the best idea cause they make only so much donuts everyday and by the end slim pickings truth nothing worst then stale donut I got down little earlier because not sure where the place was and parking downtown flat out sucks Honest if you park near Donut Bar they have self pay parking meters If ur lucky depending time of day its SUPER easy and cost is cheaper then paying any hotel or parking structure Dollar on the meter gives you hour More then enough time maybe if the line is long then that another story I was surprise but the line was not that bad only four people ahead of me Just the fact there was LINE for donut shop still blows my mind Donut Bar does carry strong name brand Chef Jeff is not only a passionate owner The guy knows his donuts and all positive vibes The minute he open the door greeting all five or six of us come on in Friendly all smiles and love the atmosphere The smell was awesome minute walked in Fresh batch of donuts the display case truly gives the donuts even more eye candy the diversity crazy oversize homer donut rectangle pop tart small circle creme brÃlÃe traditional size ones but nothing traditional with the flavors or colors and untraditional ones with donut cones fill with ice cream or strawberry split and it long line of donut goodies You might forget the selection at the top of the line The place is small so gets filled up fast if want sit down It located literally next to Carson Kitchen or look for the famous Donut Bar sign outside The stumpton cold crew deserves shout out I never had that brand before I decided try the coconut flavor cold brew in carton It was perfect compliment go with the donuts They have other flavors I believe one was chocolate and the other not sure They also offer it on tap if you like The donuts the pop tart is HUGE If one person can eat one that pretty good The way pop tart melting into the donut not sure if tasted any of the crust associate with pop tart The filling you know if fan of pop tart is true and true The icing and the goodies on top just pushed it sugar overload I loved it The creme brÃlÃe was good I think that one better eat it on the spot cause the longer it sits the crack on top break it apart Rock solid I had fill out my box was got strawberry split The strawberries was fresh juicy and I keep thinking strawberry shortcake,positive,562,500+,2993,2000+
Carlo should focus on quality His bakery in Hoboken has been around for such a long time and is delicious  it use to be anyway  Spent 5400 on some lobster tails and cannoli to bring home for a treat Got home and couldnt wait to try They were disgusting  Literally threw them out They were old and had no flavor  Shame on you Buddy for taking advantage and profiteering from tourists ,negative,76,75-100,393,<500
Fun colorful shop Pretty pricey for what you get nothing really that amazing Tried banana which was very good and the raspberry ice cream which was mediocre at best Tried a couple samples of their most popular nothing really stood out Definitely not in the top one hundred ice cream places weve been to,negative,54,50-75,309,<500
Coming from LA particularly the 626 area I am a frequent visitor at this store I was visiting Vegas for a family birthday and decided to order the cake slices rather than a whole cake and settled for 85 since it was a familiar name We placed our order an hour before the given pickup time and arrived around that time When we arrived inside the first thing I noticed was a sewer stench and I thought I would get used to it but the 15 mins we were there I did not or does the plaza sell durian and I dont know about it We went up to the pickup window and someone eventually helped us because it was so busy and the line was pretty long but thats ok The thing that led me to write this review was that they did not have the order ready when we arrived so it took a much longer wait while they prepared it We came in at the same time as someone else and I noticed they left way after us so what was the point of having an online order function So we get dibs on the items After we got our order and left for home we realized that the order was incorrect and they mixed up 2 items It was our fault for not checking too but could our experience get any worse I dont blame the guy that put our order together but management should well manage better in terms of work flow and get on that online ordering issue For all the folks that bother to read this maybe skip out on online orders for now because you might have a better experience going into order Would still probably go back in the future just to see if I have better experience but in the mean time disappointed,negative,313,300- 500,1594,1500-2000
It was such a cute late night spot I had the Ron Swanson with graham crackers it was AHMAYZING All their ice cream is hand made and they switch up flavors Idk how often They are super patient with you when asking for samples they want to ensure you love what you get Definitely recommend,positive,55,50-75,297,<500
Stopped in during Picklesburgh to pick up some treats since we were in town and dont have too many small bakeries where I am from Everything LOOKED delicious but unfortunately that was basically where it ended I attempted to verify with the person working that the cupcakes might withstand an approximate 3 hour drive She confirmed that the icing was buttercream so it shouldnt melt with the exception of the red velvet cupcake and something else the carrot cake cupcake because its cream cheese based frosting obviously we purchased a chocolate peanut butter cupcake cant remember the exact name but it was something to the effect of peanut butter and chocolate it was a completely chocolate cupcake with chocolate filling and chocolate icing with a bit of crushed Reeses cups on top Hardly peanut butter anything as reported by the person it was for I shared a carrot cake cupcake with my significant other and while the cake part was moist and pretty good the cream cheese frosting was almost unidentifiable There was so much powdered sugar in the cream cheese frosting you could barely taste any cream cheese and the consistency was almost gritty Very off putting and sickeningly sweetened The truffle placed on top did not taste like anything and I was very unimpressed It was reported to me by the person who ate it that the almond torte cupcake was good but a little melted We also purchased edible cookie dough which while it doesnt taste bad I will probably be disposing of The back of the package states it is shelf stable at room temperature for 60 days and 120 days refrigerated Good in theory except for the fact there was no date on the cookie dough so I have no idea how long it already had sat out in the shop before I purchased it,negative,310,300- 500,1782,1500-2000
Holy cow what a treat Hidden behind Churchs and Bobs Bikes I love good ice cream I heard from two separate people who know my weakness told me I had to try this new place I was not disappointed The cup is layers of cookies and ice cream A slice of heaven A must try,positive,55,50-75,278,<500
I didnt get any of their extravagant desserts but they seem to be known for their soft serve which was very mediocre I got a sample of the cereal milk flavor and it was OK It tasted a little like malt flavor almost bland I ultimately ordered the crack pie flavor with corn flakes WAYYYY too sweet Maybe its just a preference but the ice cream was very light almost fluffy Personally I like my soft serve to be dense and creamy,negative,82,75-100,442,<500
Plus a few stars for adorable atmosphere minus a few stars for the food The caramel brownie is diabetes in bar form more like fudge covered in caramel than a true brownie The chocolate croissant was awful Gritty chocolate paste center with a bready consistency croissant rather than buttery flakes Pecan sticky bun was hard as a rock Macaroon was tough and chewy like a hard marshmallow Awesome coffee though,negative,70,50-75,417,<500
Best ice cream in Phoenix We have tried a bunch of places and this is the best Get one of the donut ice cream sandwiches,positive,25,<50,123,<500
Today Fathers Day was our first time at Jack Frost Donuts It was to be a treat for my husband who had been wanting to go for a long time Weve heard great things for awhile So I planned this and nothing else for Fathers Day because he was going to be spending the rest of the day on a ladder in the heat painting our house I thought it would be nice to let him sleep in but when we showed up at 11am there was nothing left My husband had for the first time in 7 years of marriage actually been so excited about this present that he smiled and high fived me Never have I gotten anything but a meh from him for ANYTHING before But when we walked in and were told they were sold out four hours after opening with no plans to restock their shelves for the rest of the 9 hours they were supposed to be open my husband was so disappointed and so was I I had finally done something that he really wanted and it was ruined because they run a crappy business They dont even have a website or a menu When we walked in the girl at the counter asked us if we had preordered Were we supposed to How would we know to do that Where is that requirement posted We will NEVER go back They may have trendy donuts that everyone is going bonkers for now but they suck at customer service and they lost me today Screw it Ill buy a dozen glazed donuts at the store shoot whip cream all over them and sprinkle a bunch of Reeses Pieces on them Done,negative,287,250-300,1460,1000-1500
Not sure why everyone likes this place Over priced sweets that taste like paper My macaroon was so hard I had to throw it out Not a fan,negative,28,25-50,139,<500
Before the Milk store had opened the CEO of the Cosmo had a cake ordered for a birthday he was celebrating at the restaurant I work at upstairs After cutting the cake of course I tasted a piece from what was stuck to the cardboard bottom after slicing I was so disappointed and didnt understand the craze I figured it was probably just because the cake had been shipped and was nowhere near as fresh as it should have been When the store opened up a few months later all of my coworkers and I were really excited to try everything but the majority of us were let down The crack pie soft serve tastes like brown sugarvanilla nothing special Weve tasted tested 6 different cookie flavors which I think is all of them and nothing has left a lasting impression Someone else mentioned the cookie is tough and chewy but not the chewy goodness youd expect I gave them one more try yesterday before work and I regret it The cookies were cold which leads me to believe theyre made somewhere else and shipped there and kept in the fridge until theyre ready to be sold Uhmmm no thanks The place will be successful because its inside a hotel and people recognize the name but I cant imagine a freestanding store surviving here in Vegas,negative,226,200-250,1251,1000-1500
I think that might have been the best ice cream I have ever had Flavors were great too I had smores and coffee but the underlying ice cream base was spectacular  super fresh cream and just the right consistency and richness Wow Its a good thing they dont have this where I live 0 Cool to be able to watch them making various flavors from the second floor space overlooking the production area Definitely worth a visit,positive,78,75-100,432,<500
We have some happy kids and adults This is the ultimate sweet shop The ice cream is amazing but the cookies also rock I love the salted chocolate chip Great outdoor seating to make you feel comfortable This would be a perfect end or start to a date Actually Windsor restaurant is next door has amazing food so this is a one stop win,positive,64,50-75,346,<500
I came here every week overall I enjoyed the environment and service every time but I had a bad experience today I feel like Im not respected by the baristacashier  Jesse thats what she told me not sure if she made it up Id like some milk for my dripped coffee but she did not seem like to help me with it She was reluctant to get me the milk but instead trying to have me used the cream on the table That is not something I need and when I insist on getting the milk she took the milk out from the fridge with a lot of aversion on her face I feel like being discriminated as she treats other caucasian customers with a MUCH MORE friendly manner I feel like your store needs an ethical training especially for Jesse,negative,142,100-150,730,500-1000
First time trying Novel and I am thoroughly impressed I am quite the connoisseur of desserts and this place has a great selection of highquality handcrafted smallbatch ice cream I tried the indecisive ice flight It was all amazing The owners are local they support local New favorite downtown for ice cream,positive,52,50-75,323,<500
This is my husbands favorite ice cream shop Since its quite a drive from our house we dont get to go that often but the times we do Sweet Republic never disappoints They have such a great variety of uncommon flavors The hubs always buys a scoop or two there and then purchases a pint of their lime basil sorbet togo every single time Im not going to lie Im a pretty boring icecream eater so I always just eat the Madagascar vanilla bean icecream I figure if it aint broke dont fix it ,positive,95,75-100,509,500-1000
Rude employees The person at the cash register wasnt willing to help with the order They just kept starting at us until we ordered something One of them just threw the ice cream scoop at us and didnt even apologize It fell sideways and then just handed it to us and walked away,negative,53,50-75,284,<500
Wow Hello delicious Seriously so good and very nice people The ice cream texture and flavor are on point Go visit them,positive,22,<50,124,<500
I had a Groupon so we paid a visit Being a local Id heard good things and read about how amazing the icecream is supposed to be in the newspaper I found it to be good but not great Im not in any rush to go back Follow up I went in to purchase a gift card I waited in line behind three guys while the guy behind the counter served them Meanwhile a huge group of at least 12 kids and 5 adults shows up in line behind me The guy in front is ordering 6 different things and finally a girl comes out from the back to help because at this point there are at least twenty people in line She asked me what I wanted to which I replied a gift card She said he can help you with that pointing to the guy behind the counter still painstakingly slowly helping the guy ordering 6 different things She then served the lady behind me while I waited Finally I walked out and got a gift card at Menchies Pathetic customer service So overrated Will never go back in here or ever recommend it,negative,196,150-200,1000,500-1000
I would agree with the other reviewers 1 over rated 2 over priced 3 average baked goods my theory is that they are slow and the long lines are intentional to create a buzz that there is something great here and worth the wait anytime people see a long line they naturally are inclined to think the food must be fabulous the reality is they have 1 cashier and 1 girl taking your order like many things in vegas this just another celebrity gimmick slapping their name on an establishment,negative,90,75-100,493,<500
Anytime Im by the Time Warner Center in NYC I cant not stop by Bouchon Bakery to get a TKO or some other pastry treats So when the GFs family and I were in Vegas I knew I had to bring them by Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian ProTip If its your first time you will get lost trying to find this small outpost so make sure you leave enough time if youve got other events on the agenda After asking 4 different staff members and getting 4 different answers for two different floors I ultimately lucked my way unto the Bakery If youre walking towards the guest elevators do NOT go up them Instead youll find Bouchon Bakery literally behind the escalators Pistachio Macaron 350 I started off with a few macarons Perfectly textured with a nice chew the pistachio imparted a slightly nutty flavor which was nice Salted Caramel Macaron 350 You cant go wrong with the salted caramel which had great depth and richness Better Nutter 325 The better nutter was better than your average Nutter Butter indeed Within crisply thin cookies was a gorgeously creamy and light peanut butter that wasnt too intense Pass the milk please TKO 325 But really we were here for the TKO Better than your average Oreo the juxtaposition of the creme and the bitter chocolate notes from the cookies brought me back to childhood indeed The pricing is admittedly a bit high but youre paying for technique and precision from the pastry kitchen of Thomas Keller one of Americas notable chefs So if youve got a sweet tooth and need to satiate that craving head on over to Bouchon Bakery  if you can find it,positive,286,250-300,1626,1500-2000
This place isnt very good I ordered a sundae and asked for a flavored ice cream but was told they could only do chocolate or vanilla because of how they mix it Its a sundae so no mixing is involved so I dont understand that Then when I got it it was missing half the toppings that were listed in the description Definitely not as good as people claim Wont be going back,negative,73,50-75,382,<500
Let me say I love these cupcakes Its more about service Lets just say terrible especially if u are another race and dont look like a million bucks Before me I saw plenty of people get great service then they tried to not even help me and were just plain rude Never again poor service especially judging people,negative,58,50-75,326,<500
We came in on a Friday night and walked in with a crowd shortly behind us My boyfriend got just a scoop of the Netflix and chill flavor and honestly it was not very good HOWEVER I am a smart girl so I went for the cookie cup I chose the captain crunch ice cream and a red velvet macaroon It was SO good My boyfriend ended up throwing his out and we shared the Cookie cup He was not disappointed with my choice Would definitely recommend popping in here Try your flavor a first make sure its the right one for you,positive,103,100-150,528,500-1000
Superb ice cream parlor  definitely a musttry if youre in downtown Madison The interior is ordinary but they have a wide array of ice cream flavors  I had the chocolate and peanut butter flavors in a dish and life was very good for the time they lasted ,positive,50,25-50,263,<500
I was rather disappointed with Bouchon I read an article on Yahoo that they had one of the best donuts in the country Unfortunately a few friends and I showed up here around one in the afternoon only to find out they sold out earlier in the morning Laaaaaaaame So since we were there we might as well try something right Clarisse C and Jeffrey L purchased a red velvet cupcake a chocolate cupcake with custard in the middle and a TKO The red velvet cupcake wasnt as great as I thought it would be Jeff was really disappointed with it too The chocolate cupcake wasnt much better but a slight redemption from the red velvet Among four of us we all enjoyed the TKO which was basically a fancy Oreo cookie If I could suggest any delicacy Id say grab yourself a couple of those Unitl I get around to trying the donuts this review remains at 2stars That is all,negative,162,150-200,884,500-1000
I am so happy that my brother and I stopped by this donut shop on the way to the airport First of all the cashier girl dont remember her name was super friendly and provided great service We did stop by around 11AM so it wasnt busy but they still had a lot of flavors still available When trying to choose what donuts to add to our half dozen it was so overwhelming to choose The two most notable donuts we got were the Maple Bacon and the Pumpkin Pie We chose the Maple Bacon donut as that was recommended by the cashier I can see why this flavor was the most popular donut It has the right amount of sweetness and has the perfect breakfast flavor Highly recommend that if you get this flavor try it with some milk It is the perfect combination The other flavor that stuck out to me was the Pumpkin Pie Apparently the owners wife makes the pumpkin pie filling from scratch herself and oh boy you can definitely tell that it was homemade pumpkin pie filling No wonder we got the last donut of this flavor It was SO GOOD,positive,197,150-200,1042,1000-1500
What a horrible set up to an ice cream shop They have a doorman to let you in A doorman Seriously Its ice cream not a club Once inside the staff is very confused about who has been helped their area to work in is incredibly tiny so they are constantly running into each other and moving quite slow Then once you finally get your ice cream the cashier has to call you up by name to take your money That last part seems easy since the door guy only lets about 7 people in at a time but apparently its brain surgery Definitely not worth the ice cream or frozen yogurt or whatever it is Go to Cold Stone or buy some at a grocery store or make some yourself even though I have no idea how to do that Any of those options would be better than paying for some here,negative,153,150-200,777,500-1000
All Im saying is  if you go get the cookie cup Its two scoops of ice cream a macaroon and a freshly toasted marshmallow on top Decadent The person working there was polite and friendly We loved the ice cream  and the price was right This is a tiny little shop tucked away near the bike shop facing the street Basically you have to be actively looking for it You dont accidentally stumble upon this place If Im back in Scottsdale again Ill be sure to return A great Yelpy find,positive,93,75-100,497,<500
Meh is just the word We are Las Vegas locals I have been here once before and had an OK experience then as well The first time we came rather late there was a very minimal selection We chalked it up to how late in the evening we arrived On our recent second visit we came at a decent time midday It was the same scenario barely a selection The macaroons are OK We got the Salted Caramel Vanilla and Chocolate One of them was really stale and hard to bite in unfortunately The texture is on point but sadly the taste just isnt there They all tasted very similar with not munch of difference in flavor We also got the Chocolate and Vanilla eclairPastry and what seems like just whipped cream in the middle Also again very disappointing I by no means a food snob But I felt for the price and size I was really missing out The staff was friendly however we were over charged by 10 There were quite a few people and they were busy We didnt have a receipt our mistake So we just made a note to never come back Real downer but if I were you I would spend my time and money elsewhere,negative,212,200-250,1114,1000-1500
Great place for homemade ice cream Location is on the Ohio city strip so if you dont want to eat your ice cream in store there are places to walk to The ice cream is tremendous smooth in texture and tastes great Being homemade ice cream this location features the magic shop where all the ice cream is made while you wait,positive,62,50-75,331,<500
I was not impressed We were just passing by when I thought it would be nice to enjoy a cupcake for an afternoon snack What a waist We got 4 cupcakes for which we paid almost 20 and three of us ended up dumping half of our cupcakes For gourmet cupcakes especially at that price I definitely expected more Wont go there again,negative,63,50-75,332,<500

I went to Sprinkles during its first month or so of opening and was excited because of the hype and when I got my cupcake I was so disssappointed It was disgusting I dont know if it was just because they hadnt been open for long and were still getting the hang of things but my double chocolate cupcake was extremely dry and lacking all the flavor The icing was better than the actual cupcake and thats sad My cupcake tasted more like cornbread than a cupcake Totally not worth 3 Id rather go to ghiradelli across and spend more and get better dessert Its just simply way too overhyped,negative,110,100-150,603,500-1000
Ever since my wife and I got back from Paris last year she cant get enough of this place The macaroons are identical in taste and quality to what we had there A definite must try if youve never had them before The chocolate eclairs are also very good and arent overly sweet and heavy like some can be As many have commented already the Carmel brownie is excellent The brownie consistency is a bit more dense than what in was expecting but it really worked well with the Carmel Their drinks are pretty stellar as well Try the lemonade you wont be disappointed Its also good to know that they are open 24 hours This may come in handy if you have a wife thats pregnant or you are fat like me and wake up dreaming of delicious deserts Mmmmmm brownies,positive,142,100-150,766,500-1000
Had the smores sundae here which was not all that great considering how hyped this place is Just because the items that go into this sundae are sweet doesnt mean that they should go together The Belgian chocolate ice cream is actually good however Service here is also extremely lacking manager had an attitude from the getgo It seems her priority was training her employees as a simple question I had was the biggest burden to her and she was quick to turn back around and get back to training on how to make cones,negative,95,75-100,525,500-1000
The croque monsiuer here are delicious Even with the huge glops of mustard But the lattes are wwwwwwaaayyy too sweet and I even overheard a customer sitting behind me that he couldnt finish his drink because it was too sweet And the mosaic table will scratch the ish out of your phone ,negative,53,50-75,291,<500
Ice cream here is good but owners are NOT customer focussed I have never been to an ice cream place that charges you ADDITIONAL charges to change the ice cream flavor on a sundae until today Very nickel and dime I usually would not object to something like this but they already charge very high premium prices and it felt like buying a car with the upsell prices When you buy one scoop of ice cream are the prices different for every scoop If I want a scoop of Belgium Chocolate the price should be less since the other flavors cost more to substitute from the smores sundae right First time I had ice cream and left with a bad taste in my mouth actually in the end I left without ordering what I intended and went to Cold Stone While the ice cream is good Im not sure it is worth the attitude,negative,154,150-200,813,500-1000
Ive had milk bar shipped to Washington and the cakes are delicious I thought they would be even better fresh from the bakery so I bought one during my trip to Las Vegas It was terrible nothing like the Milk Bar Ive had before The cake was very dry and the truffles on top were hard as a rock So disappointed since I have been such a fan,negative,68,50-75,346,<500
Found this gem in the Venetian Amazing amazing amazing We got a slice of the rainbow cake and it was the perfect balance of cake and icing We also ordered two lobster tails I wish we ate them right away We waited a tad too long to eat them and they were a bit hard Taste was there though you know that its the most popular item they have when there were only a few left on the tray Hehe,positive,80,75-100,399,<500
This place is a waste of time You wait in line for over an hour Granted I understand their method of a conventional style bakery But to that fact maybe you should include on your website the fact not all of your desserts are served daily Very disappointed and feel that they should fix situations like this instead of the usual sorry and smile,negative,64,50-75,353,<500
First off the thing that caught my eye about this place was how it looked so much like a movie theatre from the outside My husband and I decided to spontaneously check it out and we were impressed It was very spacious and lots of seating even on the second floor where you can look out to the production floor of the staff making the ice cream I ordered the Chocolate Peanut Butter Cup and it was just okay for me it was a bit too sweet but props for adding real PB cups to the mix I would definitely like to check out their other flavours in the future,positive,110,100-150,561,500-1000

Alright I know Im spoiled because I come from LA where there are 15 artisinal highquality ice cream shops in one square mile so it might not be fair But I was not at all blown away by Sweet Republic My biggest issue is that the flavors had an odd texture  they not only left a sandy feeling on my spoon but while I ate it I felt like there was a slippery thick film on the roof of my mouth Ive experienced this before with offbrand whipped cream Its not a pleasant texture at all Fortunately the flavor options are great The Mayan chocolate almond brittle and brown butter pecan were delicious If you put brittle in ice cream I will eat it I just wasnt a huge fan of the aftertexture if thats a thing,negative,138,100-150,722,500-1000
The birthday cake is the most overhyped thing Ive ever eaten It tasted like a grocery store cake with some flavored frosting Id rather gamble that 15 bucks away Momofuku has been a giant pile of disappointment,negative,37,25-50,215,<500
I just tried this place for the first time and I think this may be my favorite bakery in Charlotte The desserts are delicious I had been wanting to try this place and am so happy that it lived up to the hype My favorite item was the oatmeal cream pie Other items I had were pumpkin loaf apple caramel cheesecake bar cinnamon coffee cake  apple hand pie All were delicious Everything is so flavorful and perfectly spiced I cant wait to come back and try one of their cakes,positive,91,75-100,486,<500
I was so stoked to come here I got a dipped cannoli rainbow chocolate fudge cake crumb cake and an mms cookie the cakes were both the biggest disappointment extremely dry and cant even eat the crumb cake just no flavor The cannoli was alright just very bland Spent a lot of money here and feel like a huge waste of money I dont recommend this place Hype is not there,negative,71,50-75,379,<500

We used to love going to Mary Coyle Wed even go there to buy a quart of ice cream to take home However lately their quality has gone downhill and their service is awful We were warmly greeted when we walked in However our ice cream was served in small paper cups not the nicer and larger glass cups they used to have And only plastic spoons The teens who were working were insensitive to the customers They laughed and carried on such loud conversations that we couldnt hear each other across the table We asked them to tone it down but within a few minutes they were loudly socializing with each other again Dont they have things to do when there are no customers in line The quality of the ice cream has deteriorated too The flavors are bland and lack the richness they used to have There are so many ice cream shops in the area that I cant imagine how Mary Coyle stays in business Its been our goto ice cream shop for many years in the former location and now in this location But were crossing it off the list Even the grocerystore ice cream is better,negative,201,200-250,1087,1000-1500

I was sadly disappointed by Milk Bar We ended up not finishing any of the items we got We got the cereal milk ice cream and it tasted like cornflakes that barely touched milk I honestly wouldve preferred plain vanilla over this The milk bar pie was also disappointing and we got two cookies that tasted stale We both agreed we wish we wouldve stopped elsewhere for our late night dessert  I wish we wouldve tried out their cake instead of the ice cream pie and cookies not sure if its worth trying again after our disappointment I will say the customer service was great and the employees did a great job turning orders quickly I think the product flavors were sadly just not for us,negative,127,100-150,701,500-1000
Wow really Bought one item from them a ham and cheese croissant First I couldnt pay with my credit card since they werent ready for such a strange form of payment Then they were supposedly heating my order up with their toaster oven press and when I got to my room it was as if they had taken it out of the refrigerator Too bad I didnt notice it until I was already to my room Obviously they didnt have their little heater plugged in or something Plus the woman at the counter who took my cash didnt even say thank you The other lady who thought she was heating up my order did say thank you to me Thats the only reason theyre getting two stars and not one You provide lousy service you get one or two stars from me on Yelp Dont underestimate the power of reviews from real customers Itll decrease your businesses if you stink Thanks for reading,negative,163,150-200,873,500-1000

Visiting Phoenix and noted the rave reviews on this place so decided to try this on our way back to our hotel When we came at around 830 PM on Friday night there was only one other couple in front of us so we were served pretty quickly Service Only 2 people working We were greeted immediately when we walked in but I got the feeling that I was supposed to have known what I wanted at that time The employee who helped us was not super friendly but maybe it had been a long shift or Ice cream My husband got the TC2 and the salted caramel and I got the almond buttercrunch and apple cinnamon I also sampled the honey blue cheese and the sugar and spice I didnt get much of the almond flavor out of the almond buttercrunch but the other flavors were alright The texture was not great  kind of icy not very creamy for all the hype around this place Pricing Reasonable If one is in the area and wants ice cream with original flavors for a decent price might stop in Otherwise I would not recommend going out of ones way for the ice cream here Allinall my husband and I were nonplused were also spoiled by some really great ice cream in the SF bay area,negative,225,200-250,1188,1000-1500
Updating this review as the old Ninetys is LONG GONE and the new Ninetys is my new ice cream goto The owners are incredibly friendly and super helpful when picking from the variety of ice cream and cookie dough treats they have available Their milkshakes are spoton for extra you can add icing and toppings on the outside for that perfect instagram photo and their macaron ice cream sandwiches are messy but delicious I would highly recommend any of their cookie dough pops While the location itself is off the beaten path in University its worth the trip to try these unique treats,positive,103,100-150,606,500-1000
Heard of this place through work Very disappointed Flys are horrible and trapped in the dishes no seating Outside few tables only had one umbrella for shade so we were melting in the sun Music is blaring They were out of nuts had spoiled butter pecan sitting in the freezer with the other ice cream Horrible horrible place,negative,58,50-75,331,<500
I cant walk past this place without grabbing a waffle cone of ice cream I dont have a favorite and usually rotate flavors They have a cookies N cream shake that is out of this world Service is as expected nothing good or bad to say Im there for the food unless the server is awful I dont notice,positive,59,50-75,303,<500
If you are looking for a place with good customer service or reasonable prices this is NOT it I waited more than 10 mins for a yogurt cup while 4 employees stood behind the counter chatting in the nearly empty shop When the yogurt finally came it was 4oz for 450 Tasted good but definitely not worth the cost especially considering the wait I keep wanting to like this place,negative,70,50-75,387,<500
We stopped in on a Friday night after dinner and bought a variety of items to try Cupcakes that rely on two inches of frosting to make them palatable are not my thing  and the cake was horribly dry For those who say you get what you get at the end of the day at the end of the week  if these cupcakes had been made fresh that morning or even Thursday they would not have been so horrid this soon Additionally it was a Boston Cream variation but the pudding filling was negligible and did nothing to help with moistness Next up something that looked like a ding dong  chocolate cake white filling coated in chocolate You would think that a chocolate coating would help with freshness but no So very disappointing We also bought some candies  salted caramels and turtles The chocolate covered caramels are more chocolate than caramel so no points there We havent tried the turtles yet One can take only so much disappointment in one evening One star for upbeat and encouraging sales person,negative,183,150-200,1021,1000-1500
Always great Ive even special ordered a cake from here and it was amazing and very affordable You can never go wrong with an eclair or fruit tarts,positive,28,25-50,150,<500
Probably the only cupcake place that has made a name for itself and still surviving with people who crave miniature cakes I was craving something sweet and I never had sprinkles before so I said to hell with it I walked in and was immediate greeted by two lovely ladies who asked me if I needed help I told them give me a minute and they did We ended up getting a carrot cupcake and a water Total came up to 6 Not bad since we are in Las Vegas The carrot cup cake had little strands of carrots It was super delicious and something I never had before They also had a cute ice cream place next door but you have to go through another door Cupcakes on the left and ice cream on the right ,positive,138,100-150,703,500-1000

Wow what customer service I own a business and i have even stayed late as the business owner making sure that my customers were happy I show up its not 11 oclock the time when its supposed to close on a Saturday almost all the ice cream is put away and Im awarded with a notation of sorry man Ive already put everything away and Im not going to make you ice cream 1052 the time it was when I got there is not closing time and as far as I am concerned in the service industry the customer is always right and it doesnt matter that you want to get out a little early Its your job quite literally to wait until 11 to pack it up Ive been coming here since theyve opened and have seen a slight bit steady decline in caring about the job every time Im sad to see my ice cream shop with the mallow on top I also understand you take the good with the bad so everyone is happy Right now Im not happy Im just glad my wife isnt pregnant this time I guess next time Ill get it a 4 pm and wait till 11 to eat it Thanks again Jeremy,negative,211,200-250,1044,1000-1500
Went here for the 1st time tonight I ordered a turtle tornado It was excellent TONS of pecans and lots of flavor I guess I could be picky and say that it melted incredibly fast Too bad my wife and son didnt have the same experience My son ordered a plain chocolate cone My wife ordered a vanilla cone w a chocolate dip I tasted both after they said theirs didnt taste very good I totally agreed Both were very watery in flavor My sons had a bit of an icy consistency Instead of ice cream or custard  they resembled ice milk Not going back Jarlings Custard Cup is way way better,negative,113,100-150,599,500-1000

I have eaten here three times and they never disappoint Staff are friendly and make an effort to talk and get your order correct Ghirardelli chocolate is my favorite so I am some biased but the ice cream chocolate chip cookies and candy selection are out of this world The first time I go was sundae with Ghirardelli fudge and two kinds of ice cream Of course I also bought a bag of assorted Ghirardelli squares to go The second time I tried the large chocolate chip cookie It was warm and filled with huge chocolate chips tasting as freshly baked Third time was waffle bowl sundae with hot fudge and of course waffle bowl is fudge dipped as well Had to have another one of those cookies too This sundae was so big I nearly didnt finish all but was worth every bite My favorite part is how they give a free promotional flavor chocolate square at the door Definitely recommend anyone in the area try this place for ice cream cookies or brownies And of course chocolate,positive,179,150-200,990,500-1000
Jack Frost Donuts in Cleveland has some of the best donuts you will ever have in your life and I am very picky when it comes to donuts I dont usually care for the super fancy ones but these are amazing They have a huge selection You can have plain donuts or go nuts and get ones with creamy fillings or tops My favorite is the chocolate cream filled and this is the only place where I have found a chocolate cream filled that is not so sweet you cant eat it without your teeth hurting The service is great They are so friendly You will love this place If you are every within 30 miles go there,positive,118,100-150,606,500-1000

It makes me sad to write this review Ive been a fan of cakeboss for a while Meanwhile my wife and I were in New York we passed by his Hoboken New Jersey location That was overpriced and under delivered big time We got there late so there was not much selection I wanted to give him another shot when we were in Vegas My wife wanted to try his lobster tails and I wanted the cannoli We got 4 lobster tails one cannoli and one eclair Unfortunately it was the same thing as last time The lobster tails were overcooked the cannoli cream had little flavor and the eclair tasted worst than store bought Im not sure whats up with Carlos As a business owner I would be paying attention to the reviews All of his locations have low performing reviews Yet either hes not paying attention or doesnt care Im not sure but I dont believe he deserves the title of cake boss with horrible desserts like the overpriced once Ive tried This is my opinion Save your time and money,negative,183,150-200,990,500-1000
Anyone rating this place above 2 stars has only experienced cupcakes from a box I have been following Sprinkles for years Pretty much since the beginning of Cupcake Wars The minute I heard Sprinkles was opening I was thrilled I had to try it I went on a Sunday and settled of a mini red velvet mini chocolate marshmallow Lemon and Vanilla meets Chocolate I also got a kiddie sundae with red velvet ice cream and a mini dark chocolate cupcake WHAT a disappointment Heres a breakdown Red Velvet Cake is okay but the frosting tastes like chip dip Mini Chocolate Marshmallow Forgettable Lemon Frosting is good but the cake which has no hint of lemon whatsoever tastes like a cross between a dry biscuit a pancake and coffee cake Awful Vanilla Meets Chocolate See lemon for cake Frosting too sweet All you tastes is sugar Dark chocolate Grab a cup of milk Extremely dry and very bitter Youll like it if you really love super dark chocolate Red Velvet Ice Cream Have you ever had an ice cream sandwich One of the ones you get from the ice cream man Well remove the ice cream in the middle and crumble and red velvet cupcake in it Voila Now you have Sprinkles Red Velvet ice cream I wont attack the price for these concoctions because it is located on the strip As a selfprolaimed cupcake connoisseur I will say that this is the worst cupcake establishment in Vegas Its even worse than Caked which is hard to believe I caution you to save your money,negative,265,250-300,1493,1000-1500

I cant tell you if this is the best ice cream in Madison but I can tell you Im totally happy that I tried it If I lived in Madison Id easily go here all the time I decided to go with the Alumni Park After Dark Chocolate It obviously wasnt dark because it was in the middle of the day but I couldnt pass up dark chocolate ice cream It was dark chocolate ice cream with white chocolate chips You should know that the white chocolate chips were more like shavings than chips I IMMEDIATELY FELL IN LOVE It was also supposed to have caramel I didnt taste the caramel in my scoop but it was certainly gooey I decided on a waffle cone It was a small mistake because there was a hole in the bottom It made things messy It is true what they say The messier the dish the better but when I eat ice cream the last thing I want to be is all sticky This place is like most shops Pick your cone or bowl Choose your size Pick your flavors They have some typical flavors like vanilla cookies and cream and mint chocolate chip They also have other flavors All of them sound delicious I want to go back to try their orange custard chocolate chip If youre near this place and need a refreshing treat go here After you get your ice cream there are also plenty of places to walk around outside There were hordes of people the day I was there Ok maybe not hordes but I couldnt pass up the opportunity to use hordes in a review,positive,278,250-300,1449,1000-1500
Some days you just need ice cream Yesterday was one of those days Ive never been to Jenis before though Ive walked by it on King St in Charleston Theres always a line there and Id heard a lot of buzz about it coming to Charlotte My sister who lives in Charleston had always told me it was overrated but I knew I needed to try it for myself After a lunch in South End I convinced her to go with me to share some dessert There wasnt a line when we got there though we did have to wait for the people in front of us to sample quite a few flavors We shared a flight of minis Id never had an ice cream flight before and Im sold I loved getting to try different flavors and scooping some of it up with the pieces of waffle cone was a great touch We picked Frose Lavender Wildberry and Gooey Buttercake The Frose was absolutely incredible It had a strong pear flavor The Gooey Buttercake was also fabulous Very sweet in the most satisfying way The Lavender Wildberry was only okay somewhat of a disappointment to me The texture of all of them was slightly differently but very good My sister said to always order the Pear and Riesling when its on the menu Its a cute little place I liked the decorations inside There arent many seats inside but there was a lot of space outside All in all I wont wait in a line for it ever I think its too expensive 6 for the flight but I will pay that price occasionally But its darn good ice cream,positive,281,250-300,1480,1000-1500
Fresh ice cream great service served in a brightopen setting thats the Mitchells experience This location in Ohio City is right in the middle of great restaurants and shopping and its the place we go to for dessert after spending a few hours dining and exploring the area The storefront is located in front of their large processing facility so you can see the actual fresh ingredients going into their product Nothing to hide hear you can literally stand along a glass wall and watch ice cream being made While youre there dont forget to get some to go home with  theyll even sell you some dry ice to make sure it makes it home safely Seriously I cannot get enough of this place You should go NOW,positive,129,100-150,724,500-1000
I had the cannoli and this definitely is not a New York cannoli The impastata was most likely thinned out with whipped cream I can guarantee Carlos doesnt make their cannoli the same way on the east coast If they did they would be out of business I was very disappointed,negative,51,50-75,276,<500
I grew up in NYC the home of the best Italian pasty shops in the world It is the only thing I miss about NYC I was very excited when I read that Carlos was opening here in Las Vegas I like many others watched the tv show and enjoyed it I was sure I was finally going to get authentic Italian pastry right here in my town The first time we attempted to buy some pastries the line was out the door and we gave up We went again last week and were successful One of my favorite pastries is sfogiliatella I bought four I was in heaven When I got home I attacked my first one It was horrible It was DRY DRY Such a disappointment My husband tried the second and he agreed I wound up just throwing the other two away Im soooooooo disappointed,negative,148,100-150,757,500-1000

Omg in love I love that Vegas has a place like this It reminds me something you would see in a smaller town and back on the East coast I love little ice cream places like this The best deal is the four scoop sampler You get four scoops of ice cream for 425 What a steal I got this and tried chocolate chip cookie dough pistachio chocolate peanut butter and another peanut butter flavor but the name escapes me oops   I loved the pistachioone of my favorite flavors for sure There is no inside to this place so be prepared to wait outside It also can be very busyI waited over a half hour last time I was there It would be nice if they were better staffed to accommodate the large crowds because last time they only had two people working,positive,145,100-150,759,500-1000
Nice little shop right on Liberty near Point State Park and the Cultural District Stopped in the evening looking for some chocolate truffles to surprise my wife with at home They have lots of other sweet options as well including cookie dough and ice cream too but the truffles were speaking to me Price was reasonable and I got a 4pack sampler of peanut butter dark chocolate fudge Guinness and Espresso The fudge and peanut butter were our favorites overall but each was good in its own right Will probably stop in again soon,positive,94,75-100,537,500-1000
Im going to give this place two stars instead of one for two reasons 1 The cashierserver was very kind 2 I love the idea of this place Unfortunately the food itself fell flat Both the smoothie and the flavored ice tea were taking any flavor at all I ordered mango for both maybe its the mango but I was left completely underwhelmed The smoothie tasted like a blend of water and milk with a bit of crushed ice I dont like super sweet beverages but the tea had absolutely no sugar and no flavor I was looking for a fun treat this week but was left disappointed Sorry but I would not revisit this place,negative,116,100-150,620,500-1000
This review is for the little Bouchon located under the escalator near the theatre I stopped by here 3 times during the course of my stay at the Venetian Five stars for the pastries but one star for the poor service Pastries I tried the macaroons in salted caramel coffee and pistachio and all were excellent These are large about 3x the size o a normal macaroon and were perfectly gooey in the center and crunchy on the outside I also trie a croissant which was flaky and light Service poor sloppy rude My latte came out too hot and I could taste the burnt milk I used to be a barista so I know they steamed it way over 140 degrees When I asked them to redo it the guy rolled his eyes didnt acknowledge me and handed it back to the barista No apologies that my overly expensive 6 latte tasted shitty Also they got my macaroon order wrong and I didnt find out till I flew home Bouchon is a prestigious brand and Im surprised theyd hire bratty little teenagers or people with the service level of a McDonalds to represent their brand No matter if its the flagship restaurant or a little express location like this one Bouchon should ensure consistency and quality in the experience of their brand,negative,223,200-250,1232,1000-1500
Got the soft serve with cornflakes It was OK I liked that it wasnt too sweet but other than that I didnt really care for it unfortunately,negative,27,25-50,143,<500
I just wasnt that impressed My apple whatever donut was a regular donut with what seemed to be industrial kitchen straight out of a bag pie filling on top I tried another of their donuts and it seemed to be the same type of deal Regular donut with a very sugary industrial filling on top I might consider for buying dozens for an event but I wont be making Sunday morning trips with the family,negative,75,50-75,401,<500
My friend kept hyping up milk bar so I had high expectations before coming here It did look good dont get me wrong but I was not amazed I wouldve shared with my friend but since he kept saying how good it was I thought id be better if we had our own cup of soft serve to ourselves than sharing I got the soft serve with chocolate syrup and it was just OK Ive honestly had better soft serve elsewhere and this was pretty basic It was also expensive as well At least my friend still enjoyed it but I probably wont be going out of my way to get it,negative,112,100-150,557,500-1000

Wow Fabulous ice cream The flavors truly are flavorful Not like some others Ive had that promise exciting tastes but never deliver These are awesome Ive tried ice cream from several other dairy programs at a few notable universities around the country and these measure up And for 260 a HUGE single scoop I ordered two flavors and it was almost more than I could eat But I powered through Fabulous If I were a student here this would be on my weekly rotation all year long Great place Quick service Friendly people,positive,93,75-100,535,500-1000
Im a big fan of the show so we were excited to try this place since we are guests here in the hotel For the weekend but we found this in our rainbow fudge cake slice Very disappointed  disgusted The counter clerk was not friendly at all seemed bothered when we asked a question I probably will not make a purchase again from any of their locations but still a fan of show  buddy of course,negative,78,75-100,395,<500
Meh Ice latte was good The cake I got was kind of dry and it definitely wasnt very freshly baked because the butter cream kind of fell off it,negative,29,25-50,145,<500
Im not a huge fan There are so many other places on the strip to get a decent cupcake for the same expensive price Its too sweet Even for someone who likes sugar And the flavors are not that great Though the cupcakes I did have were moist Still I dont think its worth the ,negative,56,50-75,286,<500
Super excited to try their pastries cause cake boss Line wasnt too bad at 3 pm on a Saturday About 15 min wait They had cool displays of fondant cake that you can see as you wait in line You can also watch bakers bake through the window next to the storefront A bit pricey around 45 for one pastry I tried the cookies and cream lobster tail Expected the lobster tail to be light and flaky but tasted stale and hard to bite into My friends lobster tails were also stale tasting Hope I have a better experience next time,negative,101,100-150,533,500-1000
Went on a Tuesday night with friends and my boyfriend and it was 275scoop Tuesday Like its an actual thing they have We got there around 7 almost 8 and the line extended out the parking lot It was pippin to be honest but the line went by quickly and we didnt mind the wait because we were deciding on which flavors to get See here I have a major love for blue Cookie Monster ice cream So when I saw that Handels has blue monster flavor I had to try it out myself because my mission is to find the best blue Cookie Monster in town From my opinion it was pretty good BUT it didnt hit the spot I had a scoop of that and banana fosters Surprisingly it was good together haha My friends and boyfriend had the salty caramel truffle and a mocha flavor one I dont remember the name but they all loved their flavors even though it wasnt their original pick The staff who helped my friends said to check on Grubhub for which flavors are available in store,positive,185,150-200,982,500-1000
Really good ice cream and chocolate I had the make your own quake shake that was really good You pick 3 individual square of chocolate from their selection of chocolate give it the cashier and they will mix it into a thick milk shake  Yum yum Little pricey but worth it,positive,52,50-75,275,<500
Only giving this place 2 because theres a good atmosphere to it Its a great place to get some studying done or a get together with a friend The desserts do not live up to the hype and overpriced The only thing I actually like is the blossom honey iced tea,negative,51,50-75,261,<500
I have only tried their giant macaron unfortunately the raspberry filling was way too sweet for my taste buds,negative,19,<50,112,<500
The macarons here are DELICIOUS Theyre so chewy but not too sweet I wish they had more flavors however Their vanilla eclair is also very good The vanilla is very light and you can see vanilla bean specks in it The only complaint I have is with the staff When asking about the macaron flavors I was told that I had the choice between vanilla lemon raspberry and chocolate I chose vanilla and chocolate after the girl helping me told me that the vanilla she picked up was a different color because it was prepared today and the others were not Great I thought Ends up the macaron was a different color however because it was lemon It was still good but do everyone a favor and ask your fellow workers before you start making things up  Rubric 5  Mindblowing 4  Excellent 3  I see the charm 2  Disappointing 1  Never again,positive,158,150-200,852,500-1000

The Bouchon Bakery kiosk is one of the reasons I like to stay at The Venetian and it is also why I prefer the old tower Located at the base of the elevators everything Ive had from Bouchon Bakery has been great Yesterday my wife and I picked up a pistachio macaron a peanut butter and jelly macaron and a chocolate chip cookie All three were fantastic In the past couple years on prior trips Ive also had their cinnamon rolls sandwiches cookies treats  you name it If Bouchon Bakery sells it it wont just be good  you can bet it will be great Im giving Bouchon Bakery 4 stars rather than 5 stars because of the staff and because of the lack of seating The staff doesnt really display much of a sense of urgency so the line doesnt move as quickly as it should and there is nowhere nearby to sit down Still fantastic place Highly recommend,positive,161,150-200,867,500-1000
The place is terrible Rude service punk kids The now hiring sign was biggest sign i had ever seen in my life The ice cream was just weird and it seemed like it was not the same as used to be when they were on 7 ave Idk why they moved and down sized but maybe they should have just folded all together The pink spoons they use were like rubber we couldnt even eat our ice cream with them The sundea we got wasnt a sundea There was chocalate syrup everwhere but in it and the peanuts where whole and not even granulated after we asked if we could have some because they didnt put any on it We got a cup of what looked like nasty old peanuts Not one table was clean but on of the punk kids was cleaning windows lol with a wet rag I though i was watching a play about an ice cream parlor Completely bogus,negative,163,150-200,811,500-1000
We were visiting Las Vegas for a week and I was very excited to check out Carlos Bakery Big fan of the show It is located in the Venetian Forum shop right across from Bobbys V Restaurant The place was pretty busy so they had workers that she cant even take your orders on a iPad they were really patient they explain anything that you needed to explain So customer service was pretty good Once your order was ready they call you up by name and you receive your order from there while you wait you could actually look and see the bakers making the cake and all the goodies that they sell Once we got back to the hotel and try some other stuff it was pretty good but its not worth on the 40 that we spend on everything So it is pretty expensive I think its just because of the show was on TV Cannoli was very sweet that I didnt finish it rainbow cake and velvet cake was just okay as well I had kind of better that was really moist Because this in a little refrigerator so it stays the kind of little old or still Overall excited to experience the cake and goodies Maybe it was one of those oneanddone type things,positive,218,200-250,1136,1000-1500

TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE The treats here are good but with all the other places in the city to get sweets take your money somewhere else where they will be happy to have you I work downtown and have visited this shop numerous times and have yet to have a pleasant experience with the staff The teenagers working there are too busy on their phones to care about helping you I visited a few minutes before close and was immediately met with annoyance It was made very clear the girl behind the counter didnt want to help me and wanted me to leave  I left empty handed and wont be going back,negative,112,100-150,600,500-1000
I am not an ice cream fan as I am not really fond of sweet things My husband usually gets something and I taste it and then I am done with ice cream Thats what I was expecting when he asked if I wanted to try this place He ordered a donut with a scoop of honey lavender ice cream He took it had a bite and offered it to me for my taste Imagine my shock when I didnt want to give it back to him I asked for my own and ate the whole thing Best ice cream I have ever had We go back every time we are in Phoenix I rave about it and drag all of my out of town visitors to try it,positive,129,100-150,586,500-1000
took a trip to Jack Frost for a classmates birthday it was a little out of the way but the donuts looked too BOMB on yelp not to go I came here around 700am and surprisingly there was a little line a good sign I ended up ordering a dozen for about 15 The donuts I would guess they probably had 30  different flavors when I was there They had a variety of cake and yeast donuts but it seemed like more cake donuts Some flavors that I remember include salted caramel counter lady said it was the best selling maple bacon german chocolate pumpkin cheesecake apple cinnamon samoa smores fruity pebbles and captain crunch cereal covered donuts The donuts are really well made The texture of the cake itself is good but the toppings were incredible and super fresh Like people have said before I have to take a star off for the unlabeled donuts I would at least have a list or a sign It got super tedious having to ask the worker what each donut was and i noticed that customers in front of me just opted for a variety box where you dont choose what you get,positive,202,200-250,1086,1000-1500
I just came back from Vegas after spending my St Patricks Day birthday there I was given a free cupcake at Sprinkles It was a good thing it was free or I would have said something The cake tasted like it had been baked a week ago Dry as could be The icing 34 hard as a rock icing and 14 cake Then the price 500 for a little bitty cupcake I could make over a dozen for less then that and the cake would be moist and the icing would be creamy From the reviews it looks like Im the only one that feels this way My son bought a cupcake and said his was terrible as well No more Sprinkles for me,negative,124,100-150,613,500-1000
Okwhat am I missing All the rave reviews and the local news papers critic award for good ice cream I was eager to go there There were several weirdo flavors and a few of the basic Perhaps I should have stayed with the basic Instead I chose the trufflethinking I was getting the sweet treat truffle One taste and YUCK I asked what it was and was told that it was made with trufflebut the fungus truffle I was not aware ANYONE would make ice cream out that I needed a palate cleanser right awayI could not get that nasty taste out of my mouth The girl behind the counter thought it was very humorous My cup went straight into to garbage I just dont understand the buzz about that place I like using fresh and local ingredients so give me Crave or Udder Delights ice cream any day,negative,149,100-150,811,500-1000

I really like sweet republic I am obsessed with the smore campfire sundae and all of the ice cream always has such unique flavors and what a fun atmosphere I have never seen an ice cream parlor with a stack of board games for its patrons to play while they enjoy their treats Its so fun The problem is this is not where I got on a regular basis for ice cream Its very pricey79 for a speciality sundae and thats what I go there for This is not somewhere I go just to get a scoop of ice cream this is for special occasions I think they are awesome and everything being made In house down to the marshmallows is so cool one day Ill try the sundae featured on the food network but until then the smore will have to do,positive,143,100-150,737,500-1000
I got 2 cake slices from the cake vending machineone chocolate and one red velvet Awful cake The chocolate was so sweet and hardly chocolate flavored even though it looks very chocolaty I couldnt even eat half of the slice The red velvet was barely better but the cream cheese frosting did taste ok I was expecting a high end cake slice since hes the Cake Boss Nopecheap low quality Tastes like shortening type frosting A cake mix or grocery store would have been better Dont waste your money,negative,89,75-100,507,500-1000
This place is located on the second floor of the mall that connects the palazzo and the venetian OK seriously this is the most overrated and overpriced dessert house i have ever been to OK its the strip I should have been more awarebut when you order 6 pastries and it comes to 68 dollars it better be the best fing pastry you have ever tasted taste was average at best But the boxes and string were first ratei suspect thats what i was paying for just another example of an all hyped out fancy schmancy underwhelming and thoroughly disappointing experience on the strip Why is it that all these places on the strip put so much into the visual experience and short people on the tatse experiencethese are places to eat not places to look at viewssmh,negative,138,100-150,761,500-1000
Pure Americana right here Some of the best soft serve ice cream in all of Pittsburgh There menu is so vast you could probably order something different every day of the summer Personal favorites include South Side Shakes Arctic Swirls and the Nancy Bs Cookie Sundae If you dont know about Nancy Bs cookies in Homestead then make sure you add it to your list of delicious places to visit Prepare to wait in long lines here but trust meits worth it Also a cash only establishmentthere is an ATM on site for those of us like me who never carry cash,positive,102,100-150,571,500-1000
They will not let you order the soft serve on the cone and the only way you can get the cone is to pay 2 more to have them put it in upside down in a cup They also did not have the cold brew float,negative,46,25-50,199,<500
Okay but steeply priced ice cream Ordered two sundaes and wasnt really impressed Mainly because the items were advertised as certain things ie brownie sundae but the starfeature item was severely lacking My brownie fudge sundae had a small chunk of brownie on the very top and then layers of bland how is this possible vanilla ice cream and lukewarm hardening chocolate fudge It was not enjoyable and I didnt even bother finishing the whole thing This is how I knew it was not good since brownie sundaes are a favorite of mine My husband got a chocolate strawberry sundae that he described as just okay We would have been better off getting milkshakes from InNOut,negative,116,100-150,685,500-1000
For some reason I kept thinkingbe kind rewind SuperStar when I seen the name of the store Tonight we came for the ice cream and it didnt disappoint My bf and shared the cookies and cream on a waffle coneit had your regular cookies and cream ice cream topped with Cookie Crips cereal and Coco Puffs I love chocolate soooo this was perfect all around This place sets itself apart from others by incorporating childhood cereals and oh so great memories Granted my parents never got us the Cookie Crips because they were full of sugar Look at me now Lol Id come back again to try the boba teas I give extra stars to places that have backgrounds for pictures Bonus,positive,122,100-150,683,500-1000
Really good long line Much smaller than the NYC store but bigger than the Vegas location When we got there early we saw EVERYTHING available We went again before we left Napa and A LOT of stuff were gone  Everything is pretty expensive but I absolutely love their baked goods,positive,51,50-75,287,<500
The hot chocolate is not hot its less than warm and one of the staff said that I should have ordered extra hot Seriously its called hot chocolate for a reason They remake the drink and its its perfectly hot but it taste like warm milk The macaroons are stale at 350 cents a piece We ordered 5 we got one free the vanilla was perfect and the rest are hard and chewy,negative,73,50-75,375,<500
If I could give this zero stars I would This was some of the worst desserts I have ever had My boyfriend and I bought the chocolate birthday cake chocolate shake and cereal soft serve and all of it tasted horrible You will have better spent your money going to eat dessert at McDonalds after chowing down on one of their forever burgers because while that food might be incredibly bad for you and difficult for your body to digest at least it is a pleasant experience eating it This place these desserts will not be a pleasant experience Horribly gross If disappointment was a food this would be that I for the life of me do not understand why this place is called Milk The food had hardly any milk if any It only consisted of sugar The chocolate cake It was very dense and served cold Not a huge problem except that there was no chocolate flavor It was just sugar Each bite contained lumps of cakesugar that when bit into my mouth could only comprehend the acidic taste of straight sugar Any chocolate or wheat or anything else about the cake was immediately lost to this overpowering sensation The consistency of this cake was also atrocious It was dry crumbly lumpy and gummy The frosting was basically solid and only sugar It was like they took a block of sugar watered it down just a little and slapped between the solid blocks of cake Not to mention the slice of cake was about 40 frosting leaving almost nothing to show for a 13 slice of cake The chocolate shake As with the cake there was absolutely no flavor to this shake It was just plain sugar with the addition of being suspended in what I thought was milk but who knows I couldnt taste it so it may have been the ejaculate of Pillsbury doughboy for all I know They literally took the chocolate cake and blended it up with this mystery liquid and put in a cup It was so hard to drink because the solid clumps of cake were clogging the straw and eating them was even less satisfying because they had no flavor only sugar The cereal soft serve This mysterious concoction mustve been made by an elementary school student who thinks that fun dip is the pinnacle of high quality dessertssnackscandy Again there was zero flavor but there was the overwhelming sensation of thick sugary nothingness Imagine that white fun dip stick that you would dip into the fun dip as a kid Now forget about the fun dip itself and imagine that fun dip stick flavor Now imagine that fun dip stick but in the form of very thick soft serve ice cream That was probably the closest description of the socalled flavor of this soft serve and even this description is generous I got some strawberry jam topping which improved this concoction only slightly It was still bad but there was at least something that resembled some form of flavor that was distinct and not just plain sugar Overall I wish I could go back in time and just go to McDonalds instead because going to McDonalds would have been a far less disappointing experience and actually enjoyable,negative,547,500+,3075,2000+
I have been wanting to try this place forever We finally got a chance when we got a free nights stay at The Venetian I dont think we went to the actual bakery because I didnt see half the desserts people are posting in pictures We asked an employee of the hotel and she directed us to a small shop upstairs foe the casino with only a small selection of desserts We didnt mind because we were going only for the macarons I was hesitant and couldnt believe I was spending almost 20 bucks on 6 cookies Ive never had a macaron and was nervous because what if they were gross Luckily these were so good We got vanilla chocolate raspberry pumpkin PB and jelly and pistachio They looked so beautiful in the box I tried the vanilla first I loved the texture Soft and chewy and so good The PB and Jelly was my absolute favorite and the chocolate was my daughters favorite Least favorite was the pumpkin The pistachio and vanilla tastes very similar to me but were still delicious So glad we finally tried this place Unfortunately its located on the strip and we dont go down there often but just might have to make a special trip for another PB and Jelly Yum,positive,217,200-250,1185,1000-1500
Ill be honest I had never heard Sweet Republic until recently Im not sure how I let that happen it won Best Ice Cream from the New Times in 2008 Failing to try ice cream that can be described as Best is unforgivable in my book But at long last I got my first taste Ill be back to taste again Descriptions of really good ice cream seem clichÃ rich creamy smooth clean flavorful But even so they apply They make their ice cream and sorbet from quality ingredients from scratch The only flavor I tried was the salted butter caramel or something like that and it was fantastic And they have many more flavors to try So Ill be back,positive,121,100-150,660,500-1000
I dont think people who rate 5 4 stars knows what the hell they are talking about trust me being from NY Brooklyn can tell you Carlos bake shop is rated low on Brooklyn New Jersey great chart The reason people think it is great and taste YUMMY as a lot of you call it is because your mind tricks you in thinking you are tasting something great since slice bread Trust me hes pastries are ok but not great just below avg,negative,83,75-100,424,<500
Ice cream is one of my favorite food groups If you want to try some crazy awesome flavors of ice cream and sorbets like taro flan halva Brie  jam Masons is the place to go They let you sample any flavor and with all the interesting options I feel like take advantage of this you know to make sure I make the right choice They nail the flavors The staff is friendly and down to earth which is a big bonus As I said I love ice cream you could give me a bucket of value vanilla and Im happy camper but Masons ice creams are always a flavor adventure However the most impressive thing is Masons events and philanthropy They have ramen nights show outdoor movies in the summer and host fundraising events with corresponding flavors and unique eats please bring back the chocotaco and PB whipped cream I got my bike tuned up there for a donation to help a girl who got in a serious bike accident All that is more impressive than anything I can shove in my mouth I love supporting a local business supporting great causes and if I HAVE to eat ice cream in the process Ill enjoy every bite,positive,208,200-250,1125,1000-1500
Obsessed with the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch Every time I am in Vegas I hit this place up for dessert sometimes twice or three times during a weekend trip to Vegas 6 is a kind of pricy for a small soft serve but the flavor is so unique I think it is definitely worth it They offer samples of the soft serve Take advantage before forking out the 6 Ive tried a few of their cookies not great Ive never waited more than 15 minutes between standing in line and getting the soft serve Seating is sometimes an issue but I could easily stand and eat,positive,109,100-150,577,500-1000
Have to be honest not that good Waited 15 minutes to place my order with one person ahead of me Hot fudge not hot at all Mediocre at best and EXPENSIVE,negative,31,25-50,154,<500
Ok this place was a treat We are talking the best macaroons I have had like ever and I go out of my way to try them when I find a place that sells them If you go here try a couple of their crazy flavors like captain crunch or the popcorn ice cream then order a cookie cup they will let use a couple flavors in it,positive,68,50-75,317,<500
This is so annoying  I waited in line for 25 mins for chocolate covered strawberries for their not to be any Not to mention I was stared at by staff for over 10 mins while they fulfill everyone elses order and cut some fucking tape and completely ignore me This is beyond rude and completely stupid The manger even came out to see her so hard working staff be complete idiots There is no sense of customer service what so ever Thanks for nothing carlos bakery Im headed to Godiva,negative,91,75-100,501,500-1000
If you want the best matcha in town this is your place The strawberry matcha is delicious The ambiance of the location is so welcoming and beautiful The staff is so kind and willing to answer any questions you may have I will be back and highly recommend,positive,48,25-50,260,<500
Most disgusting desserts Ive ever had Ordered the combo with the cookie pie truffles and ice cream Had to spit it out and request a refund EVERYTHING is pre packaged and not fresh except for the ice cream which wasnt good either I asked for my 25 back and they did a refund ,negative,54,50-75,287,<500
Do not order the pizza If your idea of pizza us bread with cheese and sauce of it then you might enjoy it I has the pepperoni sausage It had one piece of sausage In my opinion if you want pizza you would be better to get one from 711 or a frozen one from the grocery store However the desserts look fabulous It did not try any If you want coffeeesoresso and a biscotti or other dessert then this is probably a great place,negative,85,75-100,434,<500
Bouchon Bakery is one of those pilgrimage bakeries that you must visit at least once a year or once a month if youre an LV native for all Im concerned Their macarons are crazy delicious and are really large like the rest of the pastries there I would personally recommend getting in addition to a box of macarons the chocolate croissant the chocolate bouchons and the TKO Thomas Keller Oreo,positive,70,50-75,405,<500
I love to bake and love to try others creations when I can This place left us UNDERWHELMED The two stars are for the polite staff encountered on two occasions We tried an array of items Crack Pie Tastes likes pecan pie without pecans in an oilytasteless crust Still do not understand the hype around this item Bday cake slice It is a decent hunk of cake but 14 seemed highbut it was my bday so I went for it I love buttercreambut not buttercream that tastes like over churned butter The cake itself was cute to look at but it had a tough cornbread tastetexture Compost Cookie Truly the worst cookie we ever tasted It is supposed to have pretzels chocolate potato chips and other stuff All we tasted was a bland oily mess Cereal Milk Soft Serve Soft serve was yummythis was the only one I would call a winner if I had to choose one It does remind you of the sugary remnants of cereal in milk Glad we tried it but would not purchase again They serve this with their signature cereal flakes around the edge beware they charge for the flakeswhich they do not tell you The flakes were not good They tasted like flakes soaked in butter and salt Anyone can create a fattening butter laden dessertbut what about adding flavors instead Milk is a whimsical and visually appealing dessert bar That was about it After spending around 34 for the above treats I still wanted an actual dessert If you must get something try the soft serve But I suggest passing on this place,negative,271,250-300,1512,1500-2000
Disappointed I had visited Carlos Bakery on a previous trip to Las Vegas and had a good experience So good in fact I knew it was a must stop on my recent trip there However I was not impressed and neither were my friends We each got a cupcake though there werent many flavors to choose from but you could never go wrong with chocolate or vanilla right Mind you we went at 930 at night but Vegas is the city that never sleeps Our cupcakes were dry and hard If youre a Cakeboss fan and must stop here in Vegas plan to stop early when the desserts are likely more fresh,negative,112,100-150,583,500-1000
We got there right as they opened on Saturday as we were expecting freshly made donuts The employees were friendly and helped us decide on what to get We went with a Boston cream blueberry poptart donut maple bacon cinnamon roll oreo cake donut donut grilled cheese creme Bru Lee and the Nutella donut The Boston cream was average nothing special it was nice and airy and the had a good cream ratio The blueberry poptart donut was cool but again nothing special The cinnamon roll was overbaked but the very center was good The oreo cake donut was good as long as you got a bite full of oreo The donut grilled cheese was massive and was pretty good I think It came with a Sriracha dipping sauce I forgot to snag a pic of it The creme Bru Lee was very underwhelming it just tasted like a plain donut with filling The Nutella donut was good but I didnt really taste the Nutella I gave this place 2 stars because I was expecting so much more due to its rating but for the most part I was disappointed Maybe Im just not a donut person,negative,197,150-200,1052,1000-1500
They dont want neither do they care about their customers We arrive They have maybe 10 customers mingling inside We get stopped outside at the doorsaying they cant let us in their starting a line  Im not waiting outsideitll take at least 5 min and then another 20 mins before getting to the register according to the employee So we walk away and as we do a group of 6 walk up and in so they only stopped us two and not the group of 6 The employee that blocked us held the door for the group of 6 This place is horrible Horrible run and horrible in their treatment of random people I waited a month to try this place out and I will never come back and I will make sure everyone I know never wastes their time with this place When I called To complain to manager got one lady who lied about being the store manager and when I confronted her about what just happened said she hadnt been at the store when it happened another lie because I said how are you answering the phone at the store when it just happened and you werent there Her reply let me get the manager Yep Not a manager Then I spoke to the manager Who first told me she was sorry I was confused over this understanding Im absolutely not confused and didnt misunderstand anything When I laid out facts and a no nonsense tone about it being unacceptable way to treat people she tried telling me not to call her names I never called her names These people are liars and shit poor excuse of a business Good thing they are suppose to have good food as itll take longer for this crappy treatment of people to destroy their business,negative,306,300- 500,1615,1500-2000

Have been to Venetian over a dozen times but this was the first time that I have spotted this Bouchon Bakery location It is a tiny spot that is actually located outside the hotel closer to the Clock Tower and Casino so NO air conditioning We were sweating as we chose which sweets to eat This is what we shared Kouign Aman was the bomb Such a simple and ordinary looking pastry It is rare when I really enjoy a pastry that is not very sweet After we shared one we bought the last 3 to go 5 stars Better Nutter was tasty It is a Peanut Butter cookie with peanut butter butter cream inside Not quite what I expected but would buy it again 4 stars Cheese danish was different than any Ive tried anywhere Looked more like a cupcake but did not taste like one This Cheese danish was dynamite It is Top 5 in my list of alltime best cheese danishes ever 45 stars Bouchon Bakery has a couple of other locations inside the Venetian You may want to try their goodies there where it is cooler I will be looking out for these delicious treats whenever we spot a Bouchon Bakery,positive,205,200-250,1100,1000-1500

Never leave yelp reviews but me and my fiancÃ stopped here for some sandwiches  I got a sandwich that had turkey  bacon lettuce  tomato and onion  I asked for no turkey and to add mayonnaise  When out food arrived my sandwich already came with mayonnaise on it without them telling me or having it on the menu while charging us for extra they placed ONE single piece of bacon on the sandwich  When I asked if I could possibly have more bacon I was told yes no problem  1 minute later the lady at the register says that will be 2 meanwhile I already took a meat off the sandwich and they charged me for something it already came with  Wont ever be coming back and dont recommend the sandwiches  Ice cream looks very good but the food is just not good at all and no one seems to be in charge ,negative,162,150-200,807,500-1000

My party of five walked in a little late and were the only people in the place for a few minutes Shortly after we ordered there was a line of ten or so people but the woman taking care of business made short work of the crowd The selection of flavors was fun and I was quite impressed with my cookie cup flavor combination of Whisky Irish Cream ice cream topped with a caramel macron and a toasted marshmallow Drool Ill be back in 365 days or so,positive,88,75-100,458,<500

Disgusting These people have never been to Paris to know how a real pastry should taste Everything I ordered was stale Maybe they have less turnover Bad and very slow service the child behind the counter was rude and wouldnt answer my questions regarding food allergies Would not come here again and really makes me question why people go to this place Poorly managed and went even further down hill due to COVID I question there cleanliness There are plenty of better bakeries in CLT this one isnt it,negative,89,75-100,514,500-1000

If youre looking for a good dessert I dont recommend this place It was super pricey for what you get I dont mind spending money on good food but this place missed the mark I had the Fruity Pebble ice cream it tasted nothing like them I was expecting sweet fruity flavors but it was super bland My husband got the Golden Knight Shake for 15 I was expecting it to at least be topped with whipped cream I really should have looked at reviews and the lack of line here Should have been a dead giveaway,negative,97,75-100,512,500-1000
Hipster ice cream place Overpriced and inefficient Line was long because the employees were hoodlums more interested in listening to their rap music than scooping ice cream Pretty unprofessional The ice cream was fine but nothing special,negative,37,25-50,242,<500
I was SO excited to try Donut Bar I got there around 1130 and ordered 5 donuts Guess what Every single one was stale So disappointed,negative,26,25-50,138,<500
DOES ANYONE JUST WANT COFFEE How many times can you scream that at a line of people before someone jabs you in the eye Really Just help everyone in line patiently and with the best humor you can muster No one ever did just want coffee and she never did help anyone who wanted anything else Besides that annoyance and the extremely long line itself there was also the demand that we get in line when my mother and I were just trying to look at the menu board and the young man who huffed and said Thats nice now what do you want when I explained we hadnt been to the property before and hadnt had a chance to look at the board We were rushed through start to finish The only saving grace was that the cakes were good Not good enough to make up for that though Definitely not going back,negative,154,150-200,805,500-1000
Thanks to Danny N of West Covina CA for giving me the 411 on this Hot and New business in Downtown Las Vegas We dont have these fancy 6 inch donuts in Hawaii so it was a fun discovery for me We arrived at about 9am and the line was out the door but it moved quickly since the workers are efficient skilled and friendly We easily found metered street parking right in the front of the shop on Carson Avenue I ran right in and was done before the meter maid caught me Oh yeah for free parking Donut Bar is a cozy place where the width of the shop showcases their eyepopping product Theres a row of stools along the counter on the far wall if you want to dine there The colors designs and names of the donuts really intrigued me It was so difficult to make a decision but I finally settled on the Caramelized pineapple and the Coconut Dream  Im from the Aloha State and I havent seen a pineapple donut before Mmm mmm it was a delight The Coconut Dream was even better because it reminded me of a Mounds candy with a thin layer of chocolate between the donut and the coconut layer Yummy Both donuts were 3 each They did leave an oily spot on the wax paper that lined the box and a bit of an oily feel in the mouth The donut itself seemed a bit denser and less cakey in texture I want to go back for the Mexican Hot Chocolate creme brulee chocolate bacon and the Strawberry Split  note vegan options are available I heard that there is a Donut Bar in San Diego  oh ohhere we come,positive,293,250-300,1533,1500-2000
I used to love Amelies but I feel that the pastries have gotten worse and more expensive They are so pretty to look at and look delicious but they virtually have no flavor I ordered this strawberry cake which is a perfect individual size I was super excited to try it The cream frosting had no flavor It tasted like whipped nonflavored air The sponge cake tasted like spongy nonflavored air The strawberry juice soaked into the sponge cake tasted like cold water The strawberry on top tasted like a strawberry So I ate a whole cake to taste a strawberry on top Super disappointed I will stick to sunflour baking company,negative,112,100-150,638,500-1000

This one is my favorite of the Amelies Maybe because it was my first but I think its because of the quaintness of the place and the many places you can sit with friends or get some work done Their bakery is endless Never know what to get but typically select something that has raspberries Bottom line you cant go wrong Located in Noda I love going to Amelies any time its open The smell Itself will wish you away Enjoy,positive,81,75-100,433,<500

I happened to be in the neighborhood and just looking to get my son a donut I was overwhelmed with options Huge donuts Reasonably priced I think I was in a hurry so I didnt try their coffee bar With all the rave reviews and tv appearances I expected out of this world Theyre super dry Toppings are really just ok I think the best one was the jelly filled which was really rich so I bite or two is more than enough My husbands apple fritter was huge but also super dry My son didnt even his lol Now we can at least say weve tried the famous donut bar with dry and less than average donuts Maybe their coffee is great,negative,123,100-150,633,500-1000
Okay so Im not one to normally post reviews but OH MAN THIS PLACE Ive had their ice cream twice The first time my roommate brought me home just a cup of strawberry ice cream It was probably the best strawberry ice cream Ive had The second time I went to the ice cream shop It is in a cute little hidden village of shops When we first walked in we were greeted immediately by the nice owners They let us try all the flavors we wanted I tried the Fat Elvis peanut butter ice cream w caramelized bananas and bacon It was delicious I also had to try the honey lavender because I have heard great things and it was so light and yummy But I was there for one thing The donut melt Donuts  ice cream What could be better I got the Cookie Monster blue cookies and cream flavor with chocolate chip cookies Oreos and vanilla wafers They warm up the donut sandwiches and they are so perfect And you get one free topping My boyfriend got the Leslie Knope which is a European waffle ice cream sandwich He chose the Fat Elvis flavor It was also delicious I would much rather support a local small shop and this is just the place I will be picking If you havent already GO TRY IT You wont be disappointed,positive,232,200-250,1237,1000-1500
Oh sprinklesI had high expectations for you given the glowing reviews and your reputationunfortunately my experience was not good I grabbed one of the seasonal gingerbread cupcakes and it was absolutely horrendous Dry cant even being to describe the texture of the cake itself and the icingwell it was a huge amount of overly sweet goop with no real flavor besides sugar Ugh I really wanted to love the cupcakes here but sadly once bitten twice shy and I wont be back for another,negative,84,75-100,496,<500
First time going to Jack Frost The counter lady was very nice and helpful This was early in the morning and she was still adding fresh warm donuts to the display case as I was trying to decide which ones I wanted to try No stuffed creamjellycustard here everything is on the top of the donut l,negative,57,50-75,298,<500

Ice cream was ok but sundaes were not great The hot fudge was cold chocolate syrup The toffee sundae was mostly overly sweet toffee that covered up all the rest of the flavors Very disappointing If you go stick to ice cream in a cup,negative,45,25-50,240,<500
This is my favorite gelato place in phx The flavors taste so real and theres so many to choose from and they constantly rotate It tastes like high quality gelato for sure The gelato comes in a Chinese takeout box with a fortune cookie on top  like I need MORE dessert But yes The answer to that question is always yes,positive,62,50-75,325,<500
Reminds me of the east coast pastries I love Coming from Connecticut to California it is very very hard to find Italian pastries that are even decent I love coming home with two or three boxes of pastries for my family and they are so good theyre gone in a few hours The lobster tails are my favorite They are a bit pricey but its Vegas and the Venetian I dont expect it to be that cheap Highly recommend,positive,79,75-100,413,<500
Ordered carrot cake tasted like a box cake you get off the shelf at the supermarket really bad you could tell it had been sitting around for a while Very dissatisfied,negative,31,25-50,168,<500
Ridiculously priced A scoop of ice cream was so small Macaroon and toasted marshmallow were very good but 850 Ice cream was not very rich or flavorful the girl working needs to be more enthusiastic for such an already blah ice cream shop Avoid,negative,44,25-50,255,<500
Wow Dont waste your time or the calories Pick up a pack of Nestle Tollhouse cookies and youll be thanking yourself I saw this place debuted on Netflix recently It seemed so fresh and homemade There is noting homemade or fresh about anything you buy or try here Mass produces garbage  They chef who created this place should be ashamed of herself Disgusting simply put,negative,66,50-75,378,<500

Since I was just passing through the area I hadnt been filled with any hype that could influence my experience Even though I didnt have any real expectations of Jarlings they still found a way to let me down I went on a Sunday evening and the crowd that was surrounding the front led me to believe there might be something worth checking out Unfortunately I found that these people either had no standards for frozen dessert or they simply just didnt care After placing my order a junior cookie dough snowstorm I waited and eventually grew bored of standing around Surprisingly however the staff hadnt become tired of standing and continued to do so as a few other customers received their orders before me even though I had placed my order before them This could explain the watery consistency of the custard being that it took so long to actually find its way to me As I worked my way through the cup I realized that the cookie dough was as sparse as the crowd at a WNBA game By the time I reached the bottom fourth of the cup there was nothing but a thin milky soup to remind me of the horrible choice I had made After driving miles and miles on straight highways through endless fields of corn it wouldnt have taken much to impress me but Jarlings was possibly more bland than the drive I wanted to like this place but the only thing I enjoyed was leaving,negative,253,250-300,1393,1000-1500
Disappointing Have been there 3x since theyve opened and left empty handed twice You figured this is a new and very popular bakery they would strive to be more accommodating Nope dont count on it Lines are ridiculous there is NEVER any product out and when they do bring breadpastries out its not announced I guess coming from California Im spoiled and love when they announce fresh bread Hopefully they will get it together soon But for now I dont recommend going Its pure disappointment,negative,85,75-100,509,500-1000
What is the hype about this place Only reason Im giving them two stars and not one is because of their chocolate cannoli I got one of their coffee cakes and it was just disgusting Threw it away right away It was a big piece of rock just old and stale Not worth a 15 min wait,negative,57,50-75,282,<500
After I had dinner I wanted a dessert and this was next to the place I ate for dinner They offer ice cream and cupcakes so I figured you cant go wrong with that I went to the ice cream counter and actually waited two minutes for someone to appear at the counter When she finally arrived from the menu I wanted the ice cream mixed with the cupcake You can choose the flavor that you prefer so I chose the cookie dough and the coconut cupcake I went to sit down and on the other side is actually where you choose to buy the cupcakes I love the display and they have a huge variety When I took a bite I enjoyed every sing bite It was actually bigger than I expected,positive,133,100-150,674,500-1000

I have always been a Matcha lover but my wife always turned her nose up to it Well not only does she love Matcha Cafe MaiKo but she got everyone in the family gift cards for Christmas I had my first taste this weekend I had a swirl of matcha with black sesame and a latte Both were very good and the latte was crafted with care The service is amazing and friendly The options and a description of all the choices were given as well as her personal preferences I was offered samples of everything as well This is a great addition to the area and I cant wait to go back,positive,113,100-150,578,500-1000
Originally went to their Concord location occasionally and was thrilled when they moved their location to Charlotte Forget Amaliesthese sweets and the people are even better They have the best brownies Ive ever had Also enjoy their macarons cream horns and olive oil cake The staff are also very friendly Ive never had their coffee but it always smells really nice,positive,61,50-75,377,<500

Not a fan It was my first time and the service wasnt very friendly as I was asking about what to try I just felt rushed and like I was a burden to them The ice cream was too runny for me and way over priced for what it was,negative,50,25-50,227,<500
This had been a staple breakfast option for years Few people realize they open very early so those of us students and hospital workers can get a huge delicious fresh croissant breast sandwich at 630 am Their pecan rolls are so good they disappear often within a few hours Try the standard Italian favorites like casada or tirimisu I dont like their coffee only You can get things like salads and cutlets by the pound to take home which often is a great fast dinner option,positive,86,75-100,480,<500

My boyfriend took me here  the food  drinks were pretty pricy  I wasnt honestly impressed with what I had I probably wouldnt go back but they do a lot of business from what I can tell so it could be that I just ordered the wrong item The decor  vibe is pretty cool  chill so I think that may have a lot to do with why people like it so much,negative,76,75-100,351,<500
I got there at 1030pm on a Saturday and everything was well stocked Except they didnt have any crumb cakes I ended up getting several cannolis a red velvet cupcake and original lobster tails They also had samples of their red velvet cake available which was delicious We brought the desserts back to our hotel room and enjoyed them right away I was looking forward to tasting the lobster tails Im a big fan of the show and Ive been wanting to try these for quite some time Maybe it was because of the build up but I wasnt impressed with the texture or flavor of the shell It tasted like it was stale and too crunchy The cream was a little on the runny side but it had good flavor Perhaps the texture of the shell would be different if it were fresh I dont know The cannoli Im not even a fan of cannoli but this this was really really good The cream was the perfect consistency and sweetness The shell was crunchy and slightly flaky Yum Get it You wont be disappointed I bought enough stuff to get Carlos Bakery swag glass cup If I were to return Id order a crumb cake in advance to try it out Hopefully I wont be disappointed,positive,217,200-250,1165,1000-1500

This is for sure the best ice cream I had the chocolate peanut butter cup ice cream and I was sold immediately by what a good size the peanut butter cups were It might sound silly but I know weve all encountered the disappointment of getting something with peanut butter cups in it and they are the size of a pea and you can barely test them The ice cream itself was also rich and delicious I loved the atmosphere here as well It was really cool to look back and see where they make the ice cream Service was fast and friendly Also it was very affordable I was expecting it to be more expensive for some reason but was pleasantly surprised Cant wait to go back,positive,128,100-150,676,500-1000
Im not new to 85 degrees but wanted to share a review on to yelp Once theyve opened one in Vegas a good majority of my money went here buying bread for my family boba runs and cakes for parties  Covid19 review Rules and regulations have changed since before Covid Now that LV is in its second wave of reopening things Ive noticed that they dont regulate the amount of people who are inside the store with someone monitoring the entrance  Arrival They practice social distancing with Xs telling you where to stand Each of the bread is individually wrapped and masks just like everywhere else are mandatory prior to entering the store Sitting areas are closed  Staff Everyone is wearing a mask and gloves There is glass in front of the cashier to ensure social distancing rules Theyre all so hardworking and make sure that the bread remains stocked Its extremely busy with every customer grabbing more than at least 5 items per visit  Menu Their drink menu stays the same with new seasonal drinks being promoted here and there The bread is kind of like a game of chance you never know whats on display and theres no way to ensure youll get a certain type of bread since its in a first come first serve basis  Price Extremely reasonable For the amount they make everyday and the popularity of the location Im surprised they keep it at such a low price Such a good reason to come back and try new items  FOOD  Every food and drink is really top notchconsistent Any location I visit whether its Vegas or Cali the pastries all taste the same and rarely really misses the mark  Bonus The times when you go and the bread you want is actually there its all worth it  Recommend Go if you have the TIME to get all the delicious pastries Dont go with an expectation to get a certain bakery item its most likely run out,positive,341,300- 500,1884,1500-2000
Staff is incredibly rude I got there at 5pm there were like 5 customers in the store two employees were standing at the door one looks like manager held the door for customers When I tried to enter the manager simply said we closed and directly shut the door on my face I almost hit the door I was shocked Then she reopened and explained grand opening is dec close the door again No sorry or anything I didnt even get a chance to talk Why are you so rush Im not try to break into the store and your open sign was on I know you had a busy day but thats not how you serve people,negative,118,100-150,601,500-1000
Over rated and over priced and the staff can be snooty but no where near as snooty as the customers 26 for 4 items none of which was larger than bagel Not going back anytime soon Oh and the coffee yeah um NO Weak and plain even the flavored ones lack flavor We were standing next to a lady from France while waiting in line I asked her if the items were truly French she told me well they look French but thats about all Good enough for me,negative,89,75-100,456,<500
I am not a huge ice cream fan but I must say I crave this place often The ice cream flavors change constantly and they allow you to taste as many of them as you would like before you order They make everything there fresh The cookies and churros for ice cream sandwiches as well as the egg waffle cones which is the most delicious way to enjoy ice cream Its warm and flaky combined with the cold sweet ice cream We tried the baklava and strawberry and creme The place is small and easy to pass if youre not looking but look for it and check it out asap,positive,110,100-150,565,500-1000

I have nothing against this custard place Its old school and an institution Im sure It has a ton of different menu items for the frequent visitor and I am sure that its custard is really good compared to other custard stands However in my humble fat opinion custard sucks It is just not that good of a dairy dessert Sorry but custard is basically softserv iced cream with a little zing owing to the addition of egg andor a little fermentation Anyway not my thing I would much rather go for scoops of regular Americanstyle ice cream a la Baskin Robbins down the street or better yet gelato if its fresh at Pekara,negative,114,100-150,637,500-1000
We visited the bakery today We went because my daughter is a fan of the show and wanted to see the bakery We arrived at 400 pm and were told it was about an hour wait We stood in line only because I didnt want to disappoint my daughter It took us 45 mins to get into the bakery I have to say I was underwhelmed I was expecting more of a variety Dont get me wrong they have cupcakes cookies biscotti eclairs a few different pastries and cannolis No pies and a few cakes Not to mention way OVERPRICED They write your order down then have you wait another 10 mins in a very small waiting area while they package your goodies Very inconvenient We purchased 4 small cannolis 2 strawberry cheesecakes  1095 each and they are a bit larger than the cupcakes 1 sugar dipped cookie they sell the cookies by the pound 2250lb 1 lobster tail 1 cupcake and 1 chocolate mousse cake  same size as the cheesecake The grand total 5837 I get that this is located on the strip and its all about the almighty dollar but I will not return The quality of the goodies is mediocre at best with the exception of the lobster claw The cream filling was very good All this really is is the Venetian using Buddys name but the quality is severely lacking If this is what represents what you would get at one of the bakeries in New Jersey I dont get the hype It was a huge disappointment,negative,263,250-300,1416,1000-1500
Pretty poor Coming from North Jersey and being immersed in the Italian culture the cookies from Carlos were extraordinarily underwhelming Ive bought better Italian cookies in Publix in Florida Honestly Great Value Cookes far outclass what I purchased today at Carlos in the Venetian Mama would be vety very disappointed Buddy What is also amazing not really to me is that for all the reviews here on Yelp there isnt a comment back from the company I guess Buddy and his gang are just too full of themselves and too rolling in dough to even care that their quality is so pathetic Guess they believe that there are plenty of suckers born every minute Sorry Valastro but you have completely tarnished your reputation as an actual quality baker  youre just another sideshow charlatan Nuthin matters but the almighty buck huh,negative,141,100-150,852,500-1000
I was very excited about this place as my daughter loves the show Cake Boss We stood in a line that didnt move I wondered off from my group to look at the front display case where there was a cock roach crawling over some carrot cake squares Needless to say we exited the line immediately,negative,56,50-75,295,<500
The shop itself is quaint A bit pricey but its fine My main issue is for anyone looking to order a cake or pastries for an event I had been in contact with the owner Kaya since JuneJuly for a wedding cake for May I like to be prepared Communication was minimal on her part Shed email me once every week or two weeks At first she seemed open to customization and personalization for the cake then pulled every excuse in the book to avoid working with me she could do it on a tiered cake we didnt want a tiered cake well then she just couldnt do it My main issue is that i dont like their buttercream Ive seen some reviews stating it as heavenly This might be true as its pretty close to eating a slab of whipped butter it will definitely get you closer to death She wouldnt make a shortening based icing I then asked for their cream cheese icing its pretty tasty and she then sent me an email that they updated their website with available flavors and she looked forward to working with me This was in October We had been working with each other for months And on the new website guess which icing WASNT an option anymore Cream cheese Unless you are a friend or want exactly what shell make for you dont expect a lot of great customer service I dont know if shes just got too much on her plate or what but she definitely needs to work on communication skills or hire someone else to organize custom orders,negative,270,250-300,1453,1000-1500
Very sad experience with the lady who worked the Saturday evening shift tonight at 600pm I ordered from Grubhub as always and when they were short an ice cream I called the store The lady first tried to pass it off as if I had never ordered it and proceeded to read me my order out loud curiously absent the cookies and cream scoop of ice cream I had ordered When I politely informed her that I was looking at my receipt from Grubhub and would be more than happy to send her a screenshot as proof that I had not only ordered it but had paid for it she told me she could not see her screen and was waiting for it to load Finally she admitted to the mistake and offered nothing to help She suggested I call Grubhub and deal with it but I explained that the ice cream was for my daughter and that we just needed the ice cream She proceeded to completely bh me out saying to me in a condescending tone what do you expect For me to drive it over to you And I said actually yes that would be nice considering I am a loyal customer of yours the omission is your mistake and I live just down the street She then responded that she would not be able to help me further and she offered to take my number and have the manager call me to work it out Id say thats the one responsible thing she did But overall she proceeded to talk to me as if it was my problem that she made a mistake I was so disappointed by her attitude and refusal to think outside of the box and try to make her customers happy when it was admittedly her mistake I hope the owner reads this because my friends and I have been major patrons of your ice cream store and will now be taking our ice cream orders elsewhere because of one rude employee Please teach your employees basic skills in human decency and when they make mistakes please teach them to try and rectify it This is the last time I ever order from you guys Which is your loss because I was a pretty consistent patron,negative,384,300- 500,1980,1500-2000

After the way the cook spoke to my daughter today I will never be back My 13 old tried to snap a picture of her crepe being made Big blonde guy behind the counter snapped at her and called her rude When I stepped up to see the problem he continued the comments to me I dont care what they taste like will never stop again,negative,66,50-75,331,<500

Food is a hit or miss Dessert is decent First with the negative and im being a little nit picky with some of these  The orange sauce dare I call it Vodka sauce they use on several of their pastas is as bland as sauces come I get this undesirable powdery aftertaste each time I give it a chance hoping for improvement PLEASE add some salt and other seasonings Also a little less cream wouldnt hurt either Unless you like water with mysterious flakes and hair from unknown origins stay away from the complimentary water by the utensil area PLEASE clean that dispenser I used to come just for the stromboli sausage and spinach but recently it has become a lot doughier with less filling and more bread The ratio was great before please bring that back Id rather have a smaller piece with more filling to dough ratio than a large bready one If you are charging 45 for a small slice of carrot cake please make sure it is still fresh The one time I got it it was so dry and miserable I threw it out Please find a donutman asap I really miss your old donuts But why does Prestis still get 4 stars in my book Atmosphere I dont come to Prestis craving anything in particular except the cannoli and the eggplant parm I come because Prestis has created this consistent wonderful vibe in their animated bakery with their friendly staff largeglass windows and customers of all ages Even when Cleveland is bringing you down on a depressing grey Sunday morning a warm coffee with a pastry at Prestis will guarantee to lift your spirits Maybe its the warm lighting maybe its the friendly staff maybe its the rich selection of desserts Prestis just has that special something that you dont find in any of the other food stops in Little Italy Also Prestis is one of the most fairly priced places to eat in the area You can get a stromboli a side of pesto tortellini a coffee and a cookie all for around 10 That itself should be enough reason to go I really do think that with a few minor tweaks this lively bakery could be As good as it gets Food B Atmosphere A Service B,positive,386,300- 500,2137,2000+
Ive been to Amelies countless times yet Ive never written a review Must be because I was too busy stuffing my face with French delicacies This next statement is no exaggerationEVERYTHING HERE IS GOOD You cant go wrong when the food is as fresh as it is here All of the pastries and breads are made in house For everything that they cant make in house they use only the freshest ingredients One of my favorite thingsITS ALWAYS OPENno literally they never close so you can wake up in the middle of the night and get a pastry or pull an all nighter studying inside or stumble in for some fancy hangover food Whatever you want My personal faves Sandwiches turkey and brie wiring fresh seasonal compote chicken salad and Spinach Asiago open faced sandwich Soups All of them They rotate Pastry Im not a fan of overly sweet so I prefer the cheese and strawberry and cream cheese croissants Drink the best creamiest chai in the world Youre welcome,positive,170,150-200,982,500-1000
Went to Novel for the first time and loved the vibe of the whole place though with its small size youre gonna be standing in line outside for a little bit The service was excellent with friendly staff that was very informative and allowed you to try a ton of different flavors I got the Leslie Knope because waffles Honestly the waffle wasnt exactly my favorite just because of its softness I had wished it was a little bit crispier Waffle cone might have been better decision for my personal preference Got the Blue Monster and the Elvis flavor peanut butter bananas and bacon Both were very good and you can tell they were made with TLC,positive,117,100-150,653,500-1000
Ive been to Vegas quite a few times but never have I searched out for a breakfast or donut place For some reason I did this time and it was probably the best decision of my life Quite possibly the best donuts gourmet that I have ever had Located downtown near Fremont Street sp By the time we got there on a Saturday morning maybe 9am I guess their signature strawberry shortcake or whatever was sold out  but we were able to try some amazing other donuts 1 CrÃme brulee  they try and immolate the real dessert and it doesnt disappoint I normally dont like cream filling donuts but this was light and sweet all that the same time 2 Oreo  Bday cake  tasted just like it sounds 3 Some sort of strawberry filled donut All three were amazing coming from a chocolate and glazed kind of guy The even more amazing thing is that they only cost around 23 so hopefully they dont raise their prices bc that is an insane deal There are some higher end donuts near where I live and they definitely dont hold a candle to Donut Bar It will probably now become one of my Vegas staples,positive,207,200-250,1112,1000-1500
Walking into dripps I instantly felt refreshed The space is bright and vibrant Its small but just big enough to seat a moderate amount of ice cream eaters Dripps produces Instagram worthy treats that are catered to cereal addicts But the dont only have cereal as a topping You can easily choose from several different candy bars or melty drizzles There is something for everyone I ordered a milkshake Not just any milk shake but a snickers crushed and infused melody of crunchy vanilla goodness It was delish My bf ordered a sundae with Capitain crunch and my mom ordered a surprisingly delicious vanilla cone chucked full of strawberry flavor and snicker dust on top copy cat We all enjoyed our treats and sat at a cute table near the window This place gets busy pretty quick but the line seems to move rather quickly I dont enjoy giving Reviews that are under 5 stars if I enjoyed my experience at a restaurant or establishment In fact its annoying to see someone give a rave review under a 4 star rating rolls eyes Im giving 4 stars because although I enjoyed my experience I was pretty shocked to see how small the ice cream cup was that my bf received It literally looked like a kids serving And that in itself costs 6 My milkshake was huge and the cone was huge I looked around and saw others with larger servings as well Maybe they messed up the order Idk Ill be back again but I dont suggest ordering a cup of ice cream Get a milkshake or cone,positive,269,250-300,1487,1000-1500

I have to say I was VERY excited to come here I had such high expectations First we get there and the line is pretty long which I had no problem waiting but waiting because the employees just have no system going It was chaos no one was directing customers so the line was at a standstill After waiting 25min we order and wait another 10 min for them to ring is up Then finally get back to the room to indulge in our treats and what a LET DOWN Im not saying it was bad but by no means did it live up to the hype and not worth the wait I wouldnt go back,negative,116,100-150,563,500-1000

Visiting my sister out of state and reading so many great reviews about this place I was SO excited to grab some goodies with my sisters and niece However while waiting in line from afar my sister was aggressively shouted out about the mask she was wearing She was wearing a face shield from her nose below Had she known she was wearing a face covering that wasnt up to standard she would have immediately corrected the issue Instead she willingly stepped outside while I continued to order At that time I let the cashier know how rude and inappropriate her approach was and had we known from the beginning it wouldnt have been a problem She then let me know employees had been tested positive and they had to be shut down Thats no excuse for poor customer service Once leaving the cafe we called to get her name which is Terry and she hung up the phone several times once asking to speak with the manager Hopefully the food tastes better than the employees attitude,negative,177,150-200,979,500-1000
YELP 365 CHALLENGE 201494365 The Topping I Dont Like After our ride on the High Roller we decided to visit one of the most talked about businesses at the Linq Sprinkles I know nothing about Sprinkles except that female judge on Cupcake Wars is the creator Candace Nelson I think or something cool like that Still in their newly opened phase there was a line out the door but it moved pretty quickly To the left you can purchase cupcakes and retail items and on the right you can purchase ice cream cookies and cupcakes Some of the poor cupcakes on the ice cream side were melting as a result of the death rays of the sun directly on them We got a Chai Latte Cafe CubanoSeasonal Flavor and a Red Velvet Being a salted caramel fan I got a scoop on a red velvet cone to enjoy as well The lady gave me a taste before serving me a cone to be sure I wanted that flavor Their version seems to have a more generous dose of fleur de sel but nevertheless I still enjoyed it as the sweetness of the cone complimented the saltiness very nicely Our cupcakes were all moist and the frosting flavors were not too overly sweet which was greatBUTTHOSE DARN FONDANT BUTTONS They are like a sprig of parsley on a plate a NFGNonFunctional Garnish maybe make them out of chocolate because those things are pretty nasty tasting and like biting on a piece of hard plastic Ive watched peoples reaction and they either spit it out try to take a bite of it without chipping their tooth or simply set it asidelike a sprig of parsley The ATM is a cool touch for kids as I saw Chef Mark LoRusso and his daughters give the ATM a whirlPrices are definitely higher than other cupcakes in town but quality of ingredients and the name is why they can charge what they do ALOHA Shaka Meter uuu uuu uuu uuu 4,positive,336,300- 500,1851,1500-2000

Ive come here for years and years and their bakery section is amazing Their Stromboli and premade foods are absolutely delicious The customer service is usually friendly as well but recently 1118 I had an experience that left me a bit shaken and sad I was with my husband and 2 friends and couldnt wait to show them Little Italy We decided to go in and get food to go and eat it in the park The moment we walked in the staff behind the counter treated us like we were not welcome Especially the dude with the glasses and the grey mouth covering He was rude impatient never thanked us for stopping in We ordered Stromboli to go and he didnt offer to warm it for us and left out the marinara sauce completely something we didnt realize until we were at the park I asked him a couple of questions and he pretended not to hear me It was very very obvious what was happening My friends and husband were all very upset with how they were treated and it really put a damper on the entire day I have a large feeling its because I was holding my husbands hand when we walked into the building because we are gay It was very obvious that we were being treated differently than the rest of the people around us I even told him mr glasses that he needed to work on his manners and he didnt bat an eyelash Just kept staring at me like he couldnt wait for us to leave Needless to say Ive gone here for years but wont be back any time soon,negative,279,250-300,1470,1000-1500

stopped in on a beautiful saturday afternoon i tried the cheese course duo not bad but didnt stand out to me lime basil very refreshing real mint chip salted caramel and ended up sharing a scoop of bacon brittle and sweet corn w a friend bacon brittle was very good but i just wish there were more bacon brittle pieces i like my ice cream chunky the ice cream base itself was good and creamy but kind of plain sweet corn was also good but didnt wow me i tried a friends melon duo sorbet it was soooo refreshing and tasty he was totally contemplating about getting another scoop another friend got the billy goat chocolate ice cream made w goats milk and he really liked it too he said its really rich and he was jonesing for another scoop as well cant wait to go back and try more interesting flavors,positive,152,150-200,835,500-1000
I dont know where to begin HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE The worker who scooped my ice cream was one of the rudest people I have ever met She gave my sister and I SO much attitude when trying to explain how we can have two scoops and not one She handed the ice cream cone to me with the second scoop practically falling off the cone When I asked her if I can have a cup since the ice cream was FALLING OFF she said no I had to ask another worker the cashier for a cup Even the cashier was giving me attitude about handing an empty cup to me Stay away from this place Extremely disappointed,negative,117,100-150,598,500-1000

Overly expensive ice cream This place is a bit hard to find because theres a large MUNCHIES sign but nothing significant that says Melt They didnt allow me to get a mini scoop in the waffle cone because the cone is too big for the scoop So what What if I like a lot of waffle We got the Cookie Monster and the Mint flavors both of which tasted watered down Melt is an appropriate name for this establishment because thats exactly what I allowed my ice cream to do after the first bite,negative,94,75-100,497,<500
Holy moly I was blown away haha This place is hard to find and is totally a hole in the wall youd have no idea theres an amazing ice cream shop in there I am a big fan of cute ice cream shops and sometimes I find ice cream places either are adorable and the ice cream is just ok or ok atmosphere but great ice cream Fatty Daddys has both The decor is cute and trendy We enjoyed our ice cream next to a huge picture of Steve Urkel also enjoying some ice cream They have the ice cream nicely on display and have unique flavors that all sounded amazing Lots of cereal related ones I tried cinnamon toast crunch and lucky charms but decided on lucky charms Soooo good The best part of that cereal plus ice creamI couldnt say no to that My sister and I got it as the little sundae with vanilla macaroons and a toasted marshmallow and shared it I usually am a big eater and can eat anything no matter how much there is but my sister and I together didnt even finish it because it was so rich It was delicious glad we shared it though haha Used my yelp check in too and saved some money haha Only complaint my sisters friend got a mint chip scoop and there was like two chips in the whole cone a little disappointing for her but she did like the ice cream Otherwise amazing and Ive found a new favorite,positive,256,250-300,1328,1000-1500
We went last week and waited in line about an hour The employee at the front of the line only lets in a few at a time and tells you to go to the front I walked to the front counter but that wasnt where she wanted me to go where she wanted me to go was to the end of the counter closest to the hall where Id just come in from sorry but thats not the front Once you stand there someone will come over and take your order but you cant really see everything without walking around first unless you are psychic and know whats in the cases The small tiny one person sized dessert cakes are way overpriced at either 795 or 995 each depending on which one you got I love cannolis but theirs was too hard and crunchy and the filling was ok nothing worth the wait My fave cookie is the black and white and my fave place to get one is still the deli at the south point hotel the one here just plain wasnt good Frosting was okay but cookie itself not good For the prices I expect much better quality They were also giving away samples of what I was told was a butter cookie but it wasnt even close to being as good as a walkers shortbread I took one bite and threw rest away Ivebhad better from keebler and nabiscoI dont know if buddy has gotten to big for his britches and lost sight of quality control or if they have always been about par and perhaps the people of new jersey just never had anything good to compare it against Weve now had stuff from both locations and I still dont like it,negative,296,250-300,1511,1500-2000
They start off with a full menu of doughnuts in the morning we got there at 10am and they had very few selection of doughnuts left We caught an uber to get there just for them to be out of all the good doughnuts You also cant eat inside and theres nowhere to eat outside either,negative,56,50-75,285,<500

Came from Cali to celebrate my husband birthday and all he kept talking about was going to the donut bar Well when get there they have a board on the wall with all the donuts for the daythey all sound amazing but when it was time to order my husband wanted the Homer donut and big poppa tart and our friends wanted a couple of other donuts that was on this  list  and the lady behind the counter said their all sold out and arent making any more and it was only a hour after they opened so we found that very strange and upsetting they only had 7 donuts out of a whole damn list My husband was very disappointed It seems like the only way you can get a donut on this so called list is being there when the works clock in for their shift in the early am,negative,154,150-200,766,500-1000
This girl named Stephanie took my order and was so rude and she had the worst attitude I ordered one ice cream and it took over 20 minutes and I could see her on her phone in the back while I was waiting The worst experience ever and the worst worker Ive met anywhere,negative,54,50-75,273,<500
I have to say that I went into Cafe Bene due to my remembrance of them from Korea and despite the majority of their reviews here on Yelp I dont particularly love the coffee as its not really coffee like Starbucks but I like the atmosphere staff and the Korean nostalgia I get when I am inside The prices are steep but mainly on stuff that is not the coffee such as the bingsoo or waffles I would say that Cafe Bene beats out the close neighboring competition by a long shot Caffe Paradiso and Espresso Royale are really no good in the coffee department,positive,105,100-150,567,500-1000
Very disappointed Soups taste like regular cheap soup Maruchan soup the picture they have online dont look like the soup i get yesterday noodles really thick no flavor i pay 44 for two soup and two ice cream waste of many I never come back again,negative,46,25-50,252,<500
I like everyone else saw the creme brulee cracking video on Facebook so i had to try this place I was in town for my bachelorette party but i visit every month so its like I still live here I ordered a shit ton of donuts the night before because thats the only way u can try these donuts and guarantee you get what they make that day without waiting in line Metered parking out front long ass line out the door Walked right up and asked for my order Was prompt staff was friendly Donuts were meh The best part was cracking the donut in person Everything else was grocery store quality,negative,113,100-150,601,500-1000
Love the donuts I am very disappointed on the service I finally made a trip to donut bar today I was extremely excited to taste these donuts The person that took my order was helpful and her recommendations were excellent She even up sold me on other donuts and coffee The checkout was excruciating I had to ask for my coffee The coffee was spilled by the cashier The cashier forgot a whole box of donuts Ultimately I had to make a second trip which took an extra hour of travel time to retrieve my second box of donuts The cashier mistake ruined my whole experience at donut bar,negative,109,100-150,592,500-1000

I read the reviews before I purchased the cake but still purchased it because it was cute Had it delivered through Uber Eats It was worth it to not deal with the Strip and Venetian during a pandemic Anyway the cake wasnt dry at all but it wasnt good It very much so tasted like a storebought cake The buttercream frosting was gritty  like in the way that your mouth feels a little gritty after your teeth are polished but you havent fully rinsed yet Without delivery the cake is only like 36 Its not terrible but honestly Id prefer my own h go one made cake or a boxed cake compared to this It just wasnt very flavorful That said the cake was gorgeous and the colors were vibrant so I guess that was the tradeoff,negative,138,100-150,746,500-1000
Loved it  went back twice on a 5 day trip The cream cheese danish is superb  it has a hint of lemon in it along with a candied lemon peel The pain au chocolate is a delight and the raspberry macaron was fabulous Its totally worth the price and the smell of the Venetian to get these pastries,positive,60,50-75,298,<500
Looked good but beware the line to order The shop had one person slowly making shakes one by one on a busy Sunday night while another staff just stood outside doing nothing,negative,32,25-50,178,<500
Great ideaconcept but its just meh It was ok and expensive I tried it once and find no need to try it again The crack pie was better than the ice cream The corn flakes provided an interesting salty contrast but the ice cream left much to be desired,negative,49,25-50,257,<500

I had been to the Carols in New York and had a great experience My daughter really wanted to try a dessert here so I obliged The line was INSANELY longafter about 45 minutes in line it was finally our turn to order The staff worked at a snails pace but took our order nicely enough Unfortunately the cookies we ordered were nothing special I think I will stick to the cannolis and that is it,negative,76,75-100,406,<500

We ordered our cake from here for our wedding A simple cake but somehow they screwed it up Starting with the bakery in our home state never forwarding the order to the Las Vegas location Fortunately I called a few days before to make sure our order was good to go After a mere 30 minutes and 3 phone calls I thought we were all set After arriving in Vegas we picked up our cake a few hrs later we were ready to indulge Much to our surprise there was hardly any filling and they used the wrong frosting I know what the cake should have been like since I paid for the tasting and experienced the exact cake we wanted Cake boss I think not this operation is far less than advertised had I ordered a cake from a bakery in a supermarket I would have had better luck It just shows that you can have a TV show where you talk like you know how to run a business but in reality you just have drama,negative,178,150-200,901,500-1000
I came here pretty excited you know reading the reviews and all The parking lot is really small in front but there are more in the back The ice cream shop is shared by a restaurant which is called the Windsor The decoration is really beautiful and feels just like those old candy shops where they have sweets everywhere Anyways I started sampling ice creams and they were just okay Surprisingly I really didnt like any of them They were creamy sweet but the flavor just really wasnt there There was no uniqueness about any of the flavors I did get candy corn ice cream and even though it was good it got boring after the first few bites I understand everyones fascination with this place so I am definitely in the minority but I really didnt like this ice cream shop as much as I thought I would,negative,149,100-150,811,500-1000
Im so excited that theyve resurrected themselves The place is small but the old favorites are back and the owner and staff are so nice I also like that everything is right up front so you can actually see them creating your splendiferous treat The food is gone from the menu but I dont think anyone will hold that against them when they get one bite of the salted caramel cashew Definitely will work this place into my rotation of gotta have something sweet spots,positive,85,75-100,474,<500
The ice cream was delicious however I gave it one star for horrible customer service The girl who works there made it seem like such a hassle to ask for samples She has such a horrible attitude I understand if it was super busy but it wasnt Very disappointing experience especially after hearing all the rave from people about how good this place is,negative,64,50-75,355,<500

This place has amazing donuts it was kind of expensive for a donut shop but there donuts are huge We ordered a dozen and got one free They were really filling and kind of sweet so I could only eat like a couple bites but more leftovers for tomorrow My favorite was the Oreo donut that had a soft oreo inside it was so good I would say there coffee is really strong so only get it if you like the taste of coffee Overall a really good donut shop,positive,90,75-100,452,<500
Sprinkles Cupcakes delivers the most delicious cupcakes as well as a few other scrumptious treats This location is right by the High Roller and is by far our favorite cupcake bakery featuring a great cupcake flavor thats moist and just the right amount of sweetness Their frosting is to die for and you cant go wrong with any of the them regardless of the flavor you choose We usually like the Vanilla and Coconut but have never been disappointed with any of the other flavors weve tried as well Staff is always helpful and cheery and lines although often long move quickly A cute feature of this location is the Cupcake ATM located on the side of the store where you can get your cupcake fix through a machine 247 Theres an outdoor seating area where you can enjoy your cupcake and people watch Every time we are in Vegas we always make a quick stop at Sprinkles,positive,158,150-200,884,500-1000
I was craving a milkshake so decided to try Milk Bar instead of going to one of the other shakeice cream places I normally go to I had the Birthday Cake shake and it was delicious Highly recommend There was no line so it was quick and easy The only thing Id say is it would be nice if the woman taking my order would have been a bit friendlier I dont think she said 2 words to me and she certainly didnt smile,positive,84,75-100,421,<500

Came here for the Vegan option for the bf and the high reviews on Yelp Cute place where they homemake their ice cream in the back and weekly switch up flavours Bf ordered vegan vanilla cinnamon ice cream with churro sandwich 6 The churro was crunchy and freshly made The ice cream was very soft and melted very quickly I was very disappointed by this place Had higher expectations from Yelp I sampled 1 Captain Crunch Tasted like captain crunch but a bit sweet 2 Mint chocolate chip Impressive since they use fresh mint which you can taste but overpowering for me 3 Apple cider sorbet Soft tasted like apple sauce even the texture 4 Bakalava Very flavourful bit did not like the heavy amount of pastry in just the sample 5 Same cakelike flavour Okay flavour bit heavy Ended up getting small 2 scoop 4 6 Taro Good flavour not the purple colour you get other places 7 Earl grey Tasted like the tea Nice flavour Reason why I give 2 star Good flavours initially but overtime I tasted the heavy oily cream texted on the roof of my mouth I hate that feeling too much oil from the cream That is the downside to this homemade ice cream,negative,210,200-250,1178,1000-1500
This restaurant is tucked away in the opulent Venetian We went for brunch and I had the Saumon Fume which similar to a deconstructed lox bagel but better We also got the pastry assortment where you get to pick 4 pastries We thought they would be smaller sizes but you get the full sized pastry We had to ask for a box and flew with it to Chicago They were still tasty the next day 5 stars because the service was fantastic I actually got a deep paper cut on their stiff paper table cover We asked for a bandaid and I was provided with some Neosporin and a small handful of bandaids I also forgot my hat when we left and had to run back to get it They had placed in on a high shelf where I could see it near my table,positive,145,100-150,735,500-1000
Been here a few times and its a nice little place I ordered the smore ice cream cup and wow that sucker is sweet It was a bit overwhelming for me lol so you might want to share it with someone I felt there was a bit too much graham crackers and marshmallows in it so had to work my way through that to get to the ice cream The chocolate tasted like dark chocolate On another visit I took my son on a Friday night and the only complaint that it is so small that there was a line out the door so we waiting in the car until the line went down and then jumped out of the car to get in the line in the door before another crowd came lol there is very limited parking in the front Like 5 spaces max and a restaurant next door so you might be walking There is a valet around the corner but not sure if thats just for the restaurant Anyhow I ordered a brownie and it was so good Again I love chocolate but dont realize how much chocolate Im getting until I feel overwhelmed by it lol there was a good amount of chocolate pieces in the brownie and it was nice and soft My son got a kids cup with chocolate and sprinkles He gave it a thumbs up so thats good It is a good place to get ice cream I just wish it were in a bigger place with more parking Other than that is recommend it,positive,264,250-300,1293,1000-1500
Dessert was okbut not worth the 45 minute wait The ladies working there had the most dysfunctional system just to get us some cookies and cupcakes After salivating over desserts in the ridiculously long line for about 30 minutes my sisters and I ordered a few items each The young lady writes down the order chocolate chip cookie on a post it and someone else fulfills that very complicated order Its wrapped with love and placed in a bagand thensince you waited so long you order one more baked goody They proceed through steps 13 again We then wait for another 10 minutes to have our order entered into the cash register I ordered coffee and my sisters were booing and throwing things at me Why would you order something elseweve been here all day Tip throw the freakin cookie in a bag ring me up and get me on my way 3 minutes tops,negative,155,150-200,868,500-1000
Where are the white tablecloths I hope this place fails Not for the tastes of what my group had most of which was respectable but rather for the obscene and unwarranted price point Its the first time Ive found pricing to be offensive even as an Apple products loyalist It just doesnt make sense despite the location and not even for the overall quality 650tax and they ask for a tip for tossing you a prepackaged microscopic crack pie delivered to you abjectly in a cardboard box that belies the actual size of your wedge I had a flashback to one of those trashy McDonalds apple pies that come in those flashy red plastic containers I began to utter whats this to the cashier as she thrust it at me but stopped when I saw the label my eyes widening my heart deflating At least at McDonalds they put it on a tray and give you a place to sit and enjoy their classy dining Not at Milk At Milk youre supposed to stand around awkwardly amidst the mass of people jostling for either the escalator or a slutEgg looking like a chump for having bought some egregiously priced grabngo miniscule 650 for this sliver that is smaller than my small Trump hands with an embarrassing unartsy smudge of confectioners sugar NO My friends got the 12 TWELVE booze shakes and I felt sorry for them The presentation was trash a cheap plastic dome top about the size of a Starbucks tall Know where you can get a beautifully crafted booze shake 3x the size Two shops down at Holsteins Not coming back Im secure enough with myself I dont need the namenotoriety of this place to feel like Im succeeding in life for having bought something here As an accomplished amateur baker my dreams for this place after the impressive marketing they did preopening were shot Total implode Its an insult to anyone who knows their way around confections or who respects the American dollar,negative,336,300- 500,1918,1500-2000
This crepe stand is inside the West Side Market There was a pretty short line but the process took awhile because there are only 3 crepe machines for cooking Cant really blame the worker though he kept moving the entire time The menu offers good suggestions or you can make your own crepe I got one with asparagus ham and brie and really enjoyed it With both sweet and savory options this is a good spot for lunch or a snack Theres a coffee stand right next to the crepe stand which is convenient as well,positive,96,75-100,515,500-1000
Im not fond of this ice cream It tastes thin to me Maybe not enough milk fat A lot like old fashioned ice milk,negative,24,<50,115,<500
This place is super kitschy and honestly that was my favorite thing about it I loved getting to check out the crazy sculptures and chandeliers and reading how to say I love you in 40 different languages on the banister while waiting in the insanely long line and had we eaten in I would have loved to have done it underneath some Eiffel Towerthemed monstrosity Unfortunately the food was disappointing and it was made worse by their confusing pickup system They give you different categories of things in different bags in different places which wasnt made clear so we drove all the way back to our hotel only to open up the bag and find half our breakfast missing The best things in our order were the pastries the almond croissant cream puff and pecan tart The quiche was average and the chai was the worst Ive ever had it tasted like a ton of corn syrup and artificial Christmas cookie flavor fell into some hot water,negative,167,150-200,940,500-1000
This place is dangerous for 2 reasons 1 EVERYTHING IS DELICIOUS 2 I live down the street I have literally tried every cookie they make and theyre all good The coconut macaroons and kitchen sink cookies are my favorite One thing to note is that they rotate cookie varieties day to day All the ice cream is homemade and also all good Vietnamese coffee is my go to If you cant decide on a flavor they let go half and half even for a single scoop,positive,86,75-100,457,<500
I consider myself a connoisseur of pastries Carlos didnt disappointnevermind the endless selections you have or the prices Ive gone three times in the last few weeks and each time I get the meringue cookie strawberry shortcake and LOBSTER TAIL If you like flaky crunchy creamy and sweet how could you NOT you must get a lobster tail The cream inside this croissant like pastry is perfect not too sweet and absolutely decadent Customer service is greatbut be ready to wait as its located inside the Venetian,positive,87,75-100,530,500-1000
Super disappointing Very limited options and the macarons have definitely been siting out for awhile Way too much  for what you get,negative,23,<50,135,<500
I love how big this Mitchells is and the clear windows that allow you to see the factory work behind the ice cream making I have not tried that many flavors here but I can tell you that I have never been disappointed after coming here 3 times I tried the cookies and cream campfire smores and caramel fudge brownie The portions are large so you are definitely getting your moneys worth I end up always getting a junior scoop because I can never finish anything bigger I have taken all the guests I have in Cleveland to this ice cream place because it is the best I have had in a long time I would try to find parking close by because there is nothing directly next to Mitchells,positive,130,100-150,688,500-1000

The gluten free birthday cake truffles are ridiculous Stopped by to pick some up and was able to grab a few 3 packs Service was fast and friendly The cake bites are honestly perfect Theyre soft and cakey without being crumbly or having that glutenfree taste No mealy pasty texture Theyre perfect and it was too easy to get them,positive,60,50-75,343,<500
It always makes me sad when I come here and my favorite flavor is out of rotation I miss Strawberry Balsamic more than Ive missed any exgirlfriend but I love late night trips here because theres always something new to discover and love Lemon Olive Oil previously and Cucumber Mojito Sorbet tonight Those flavors may not be your style but I dont like sweets and this place gets me excited for bold creative flavors beyond their delicious fudge coffee Capn Crunch Fruity Pebbles and other standard fruit flavors Staff is awesome and the patio is nice comfortable and full of friendly people The neighborhood is the South Roosevelt Arts District with great stores bars and restaurants to enjoy before and after Plus theres often a great and friendly jazzblues guitarist on the corner or a concert at the bar next door to enjoy Ive also been there when a DJ will spin records on the front porch I love this place and unlike some other places downtown its not pretentious or catering to a narrow young and hip crowd This is a very family friendly date night guilt eating and all purpose hangout spot Check it out for the creative flavors and delicious homemade standards,positive,205,200-250,1195,1000-1500
Ive enjoyed a girls night out a family lunch with kids and a daughters birthday at Amelies Its a great place to stop in for a pastry order to gothe chocolate croissants are the BEST There are some interesting characters that show up after 7pm but it makes it better if you like to people watch Everything Ive had from Amelies has been fantastic I hope that its a Charlotte staple for years to come The ONLY complaint I would have is when you need seating for a group of 4 or more people and one person on their laptop is using the table for 6 But thats not Amelies fault,positive,111,100-150,612,500-1000
Theres a lot of hype about this place and as far as I can tell a lot of it is undeserved Maybe its just that Phoenix has such a lack of locavore  foodie joints that people are so enthusiastic about its arrival but the ice cream is decent at best Definitely better than Coldstone and the like but compared to the other ice creameries it aspires to the ice cream is just not there The flavors are REALLY onedimensional everything takes like a sweet cream base with maple  mint  chocolate  whatever else mixed in,negative,98,75-100,526,500-1000
Typical Chinese bakery with several dozen kinds of pastries cakes and drinks Obviously popular most customers carried trays of selected pastries lining up to pay As usual most pastries were mild sweet just the way I liked them Its a perfect place to satisfy sweet and carbohydrates cravings 4Matcha Red Bean only a few red beans on top the rest was some kind of sponge cake and cream 5Taro Swirl crispy and mild sweet perfectly buttery,positive,76,75-100,453,<500
This is one of my favorite donut shops innear the cleveland area They are very affordable and offer every type of donut you can think of The donut selection is through the roof Aside from their traditional donuts they have several handcrafted custom made donuts This is a place to checkout for someone who has a large sweet tooth All their donuts are made fresh daily in house,positive,68,50-75,383,<500
I came here today for breakfast hoping to get some of their delicious quiche but they were out Instead I got a sausage egg and cheddar sandwich on a croissant I was informed it was 75 cents extra for them to scramble the egg which I thought was pretty ridiculous The total cost of my sandwich and small coffee was almost 8 dollars which is quite a bit more than what I pay at other places around town When I got my sandwich it was pretty small and the croissant was so dry that when I bit into it it fell apart into flakes on the plate and was impossible to eat Very disappointed in this experience overall I did mention this to one of the workers and he did offer to get me something else so that is appreciated but I think they need to make a few changes with their breakfast sandwiches,negative,154,150-200,796,500-1000
i have been to cleveland three times and each time I have been to Campbells i cant decide which i like better  the popcorn or the cupcakes The new white cheddar dichotomy popcorn is heavenly My last trip I had a turtle cupcake and buckeye  so good I could not stop The service is great  I go to West Side Market There is always a crowd but I have never felt rushed delicious,positive,76,75-100,388,<500
I usually go to Creamistry for ice cream but decided to try something new If I said I didnt regret it I would be lying I sampled a few flavors and decided to get a scoop of mango sorbet The sample was somehow misleading because as I tried to enjoy my sweet treat it just had an offputting aftertaste that wouldnt allow me to do so We also tried their boba tea which I wouldnt recommend either I was excited to try this place because of the reviews but left underwhelmed In my opinion its overrated and Ill go back to my regular spots,negative,104,100-150,546,500-1000
Ordered the chocolate lobster and the standard lobster Both had exteriors like leather and had no flavor The filing although overfilled did not make up for the exterior pastry Also tried the carrot cake which had a granular texture for the cake portion and the icing tasted like fondant vs cream cheese NOT worth spending any amount of money for,negative,60,50-75,353,<500
Yes Sir This is the place The best ice cream in the Valley all tucked into a donut Wow You gotta go,positive,22,<50,106,<500
Customer service was on point 2 stars because of the fact I spent 35 on mediocre bakery treats Its an unwritten rule in my book if its seen on TV 910 times it is not nearly as good The treats were not bad dont get me wrong But for 35 Id rather support an awesome local bakery ,negative,58,50-75,292,<500
Apparently they had to change their name to Rewind from Dripp but this place was made to be Instagrammed with fitting backdrops and bright colorful drinks for pictures Im sure there will be a Black Mirror episode next season about the culture of going to a restaurant or cafe for the gram but I digress All that asidethe ice cream and drinks are as beautiful on the inside as on the outside I mean that quite literally with how they infuse the cereal into the ice cream I was expecting something similar to Cold Stone where chunks of mixins are spread out in the ice cream but they have a cool machine setup that drills your cereal choice down to distribute it homogeneously throughout the ice cream I got vanilla ice cream with Cinnamon Toast Crunch mixed in and Reeses cups on the top We all agreed the CTC was the perfect mixin because when ground to a powder form you get a perfect flavor of cinnamon and sugar mixed in with the creamy ice cream It also paired well with the Reeses on top It definitely surpassed my expectations and it is a neat concept overall My girlfriend got boba because when boba is presented as an option she can not or will not choose anything else She had an iced matcha latte with boba and I thought it was pretty good The matcha flavor was very strong without being overpowering My friend got a butterfly rose lemonade and it was tasty the rose flavor was subtle I personally would not order it because it was essentially more expensive lemonade with some subtle flavors but if you are one to Instagram your drinks the butterfly rose is a great model for photos,positive,293,250-300,1622,1500-2000

The ladies who were there were so sweet serving us at 759pm when they closed at 8 I really appreciated that Also the prices were extremely reasonable That being said the chocolate on the bonbons were all cracked and bubbly clearly not tempered right I ordered an espresso bonbon which I did enjoy It oozed a sweet espresso goo in the middle though the sugar granuals were present having not been melted when mixed The rumdipped dark chocolate bonbon was the real displeasure It was clearly milk chocolate and dry at that And the inside was so disappointing I had to write something The rum filing was a congealed sugar solid that tasted nothing of rum Ive never not wanted to finish a chocolate treat Maybe they had been in the case for too long as the bonbons definitely varies depending on ingredients Their cupcakes are out of this world though,negative,151,150-200,874,500-1000
After driving by this bakery at least 100 times over the past two years while living in Plaza Midwood I decided to finally pop in Villanis is nestled along Pecan Ave in an interesting little makeshift type plaza area next to Rico AÃaÃ also a fav of mine Blink and you could legit miss it If not for the Tiffany blue signage it wouldnt look like too much Its a small bakery just chillin in the cut lol Anywho once I parked I noticed a small line A sign on the door instructed you to wait in line due to them only allowing 2 guests in at a time No problem with me thanks for keeping us safe in this pandemic It was a sunny but chilly and windy day so the wait was a bit tough But SO worth it We didnt wait too long and when we entered this tiny little bakery it was like our own private shopping experience I took my time and perused the yummy treat options I mean the entire bakery was my oyster lol The staff was super sweet and helpful with suggestions and small talk I went with the smores bar lemon bar and some kind of rainbow situation and a vanilla coffee Every single bite of my pastries was love They didnt last a full day at home I even woke up the next day mad that Id eaten everything already I do wish there were a few more options available but I understand the times we live in Ill definitely be back,positive,262,250-300,1352,1000-1500

This is not a true French Bakery please check out Christophes in Charleston for comparison The espresso was terrible the ambiance worse I know and love French people and could not fathom the misguided decor disaster which I found offensive rather than a funky American take on French style The paintings were not improved rather I felt they were vandalized Aside from aesthetics I was not a fan of the ambiance either It must appeal to many people as this place has franchised The chocolate croissant was edible but seemed to be frozen and baked on site rather than fresh Disappointing overall,negative,102,100-150,611,500-1000
Tried the cherry pie last night  it was pretty legit Chunks of the pie crust really hooks it up I just wish the pieces were a little smaller I thought the girl behind the counter did a good job handling the rush  she kept track of who came in when and served accordingly Not sure what the other 2 guys were doing but I thought they could be more helpful Overallgood but not great The ice cream was soft perhaps due to the case being open too long to accommodate the rush and the other flavors I tried were just OK But ice cream made fresh will always have a market in the valley of the sun and I like most people will continue to frequent the place Rounded up to 4 stars for the dedicated menu of floats  I appreciate little differentiators like that,positive,148,100-150,773,500-1000

Came here on Sunday night I have heard about it and wanted to try it but the menu was confusing so I asked what they recommend The lady behind the counter acted like I was stupid so I left immediately and ordered nothing There was not another person at the place so she had time to answer my questions but just didnt want to,negative,64,50-75,329,<500
I have debated even writing this review because the situation was tainted with a mistake I made but overall terrible service I purchased 50 of cannolis and lobster tails I didnt realize they needed to be refrigerated I thought it was similar to a cupcake I didnt realize it was made with cheese My bad I dont fault the store but they all went bad except the cannoli I ate right after leaving which was okay tasting As for line Only 3 or 4 in front of me I told them 2 cannolis and 4 lobster tails They said they only had the lobster tails in hazelnut so I said that was fine Then they went in back to get them and I didnt realize they had to wait for them to bake and fill them Took 20 minutes and nobody came out to check on me or tell me a time frame I only knew because of the see through glass Then it all spoiled Such a waste of time and money l,negative,174,150-200,871,500-1000
This is the outside location not the internal one Once my friend got me hooked on the macarons I had to have some more The shop wasnt very busy and the folks on the inside were more than happy to help I bought one box of six small macarons one of each flavour and I bought 8 of the larger ones When They brought out a tray of the pistachio after theyd filled my box and Id already paid for it I have to admit I was disappointed Seeing that the gentleman helping me gave me one gratis  Thats what I call customer Service WAY TO GO Youll have my business from now on,positive,115,100-150,586,500-1000
Delicious place  we have stopped by here when we are in town due to it being a little further than the rock hill location we usually go to This spot is just as friendly and unique and lovely as the other locations  The pastries are absolutely delicious and I love going there every single time it leaves me so so happy  We ordered the macaroon gateau for valentines day the previous year and they were very friendly when we called to place the order and had no problems picking it up It was absolutely worth the money and we enjoyed it for that special occasion,positive,108,100-150,568,500-1000
Picked up some ice cream for dessert  had to choose two flavors for a small cup Went with the coffee and donuts and the pretzel ice cream The flavors were really good but the mix in tasted stale I would most likely go with a flavor without chucks of a topping,positive,52,50-75,265,<500
1 star off I stopped by this bakery around noon on a Thursday and there were no croissants left Arent croissants a staple of French bakeries 1 star off No apology 1 star off No indication of when they will have a new batch Just that there were no more croissants I looked at the display case and there were only a few macaron flavors left as well I like the Bouchon Bakery in Napa a lot so I wanted to try this location I just wish this location is better stocked especially with the items that make it unique Otherwise it is just like a Starbucks,negative,107,100-150,569,500-1000
I would not recommend Was there on 128 pm The middleage guy who helped us was rude He acted like we were a pain by asking what two of their flavors were As much as we wanted some ice cream from Handels we went to another ice cream shop,negative,49,25-50,244,<500

9 for a shake thats just soft serve stirred in a cup I also got a chocolate cookie It tastes like the flour and baking soda are over added I went there thinking youd get hotwarm cookies theyre packaged and who knows how long theyve been there I guess my expectations were set very high for this spot but I see that the NYC location is better,negative,67,50-75,354,<500
I was really excited to try Milk Bar I watched The Mind of a Chef awhile back and my favorite segments were of Christina Tosi We dont have a Milk Bar here in Vancouver and so when I found out there was one in Las Vegas I told my sister that we HAD to go there before we leave to pick up some cookies to take home My sister and I made a special stop at Cosmopolitan just for them I bought one of each kind compost cookie blueberry cream cheese chocolate cornflake marshmallow double chocolate and corn They werent cheap thats for sure and with the exchange rate even more so Thus I had some high expectations I was a bit nervous though seeing them prepackaged and not baked on site but hoped for the best I was sadly disappointed I shared the cookies with my husband and parents Out of all of them I preferred the compost cookie but it was meh at best Maybe it was because I was expecting a bit of crunch from the pretzel and potato chip pieces but there was barely any crunch Second favorite was the corn cookie but had wished for a stronger corn flavour and maybe some texture from cornmeal The blueberry cookie was okay It was soft which was nice but it just tasted really sweet and the blueberries tasted fake to me were a bit spoiled here with fresh blueberries all summer long The double chocolate cookie I did not like at all Ive baked Tartine Bakerys recipe for salted chocolate rye cookies That is a damn good chocolate cookie This cookie lacked any depth of flavour and just tasted like cocoa with a bitter after taste if that makes sense that I could not get out of my mouth The chocolate cornflake marshmallow was good The cornflakes added a bit of crunch and the marshmallows took me back to my childhood because it tasted a bit like the marshmallows you found in cereal Who knowsmaybe if they were fresh baked right out of the oven it would be a different story But unfortunately the taste did not live up to the hype or the price,negative,368,300- 500,1992,1500-2000

I came here with some friends for breakfast because I heard good things about the place I ordered the pecan sticky bun because it looked delicious It tasted however terrible It was hard like a rock not like a sticky bun ought to be I had to ask for another one and the lady realized all the other buns were hard too so she had to take it back to microwave it to soften it Didnt help too much The chocolate croissant tasted like chocolate bread NOT a croissant Bread The apple turnover was decent  it had some crispy texture to it with an ok filling McDonalds makes better apple pies The twice baked croissant with almonds was pretty good  probably the best thing I tried that morning Salted caramel brownie was very dense It had good flavor but theres no way I could eat an entire thing or even half of one in one sitting Maybe I just dont get the salted caramel craze At least the coffee was pretty good And you get a free refill A little bit of redemption there Im just not sure why this place has such great ratings Some may say decor environment convenience of it being 24 hours etc But if the food is no good why should any of that other stuff matter Just go to Waffle House Its cheaper there,negative,232,200-250,1241,1000-1500
Visiting a local friend who told me we HAD to grab some of these while we were out looking at rentals I had read several reviews and was expecting to be rushed and overwhelmed The counter guy was super friendly and helped me when I asked a few questions We got a half dozen and they were the BEST donuts Ive ever had Im a big fan of cake donuts so imagine my surprise when my favorite was the raised donut with powdered sugar and big gob of icing on top So Damn Good,positive,94,75-100,476,<500

This place is great SO MANY flavors to choose from Not only that so many different ways to have your ice cream too Its a bit overwhelming but in a good way This is a walk up place so dont expect to sit anywhere besides the benches They make ice cream from scratch and you can tell from the flavors and textures Its smooth and not icy like something thats been sitting and refrozen like other places The service is friendly and quick Dont hesitate to ask for samples because they encourage it I chose the twix parfait and did not regret it It was quite large and my boyfriend told me I would not finish it Well he was wrong because I basically inhaled it Their hot fudge is so good Almost as good as nielsens hot fudge In this case coming in second to that is not a bad thing I cant wait to go back and try more flavors,positive,162,150-200,842,500-1000
You want creamy fluffy ooeygooey delicious ice cream Then youre in luck This is the place for you I wish I would have known that this place existed long before having tried other ice cream shops that horribly messed with my taste buds This place is EXACTLY what the doctor ordered I had a banana split  Sebastian helped make this yummy creation He was super friendly  helpful  helped me enjoy ice cream once again I love their decor inside just candy  yumminess all around They may have simple flavors but it is all about what you do with those flavors is what makes this place unique They have smore sundaes  girl scout cookie flavored ice cream I will need to find a dentist real fast because I have such a sweet tooth for this place,positive,140,100-150,762,500-1000
I have been wanting to try this place forever but Ive avoiding it because like ever other local I hate the strip I was in the Venetian and accidentally ran into this little gem I was unprepared shocked excited I knew that I wanted to try the macaroons At the 350 a pop I could only justify getting one I settled on my favorite flavor pistachio and ordered a chocolate chip cookie as well The macaroon was overly sweet To me it tasted like an Andes mint flavored macaroon so maybe they use mint for color There was only a subtle hint of pistachio I was completely disappointed The macaroons in the freezer section at Walmart are 10 times better The chocolate chip cookie was okay The chocolate chips were fantastic but the cookie was just average Definitely not something Id go back for If youre on the Strip there are far better options that are more deserving of your money and caloric intake Skip this one,negative,167,150-200,938,500-1000
the cereal milk soft serve is definitely tasted like cereal milk we had the cereal toppings which is a bit salty the crack pie was very dense it tasted good the crack pie soft serve was not as tasty as the crack pie overall it is very good,positive,48,25-50,245,<500
This is opening week hopefully the ordering and serving process gets revised I stop in for my free cannoli and a cup of coffee this morning Placed my order and they wrote it down Wth its coffee and cannoli just serve it I wait 15 minutes for my cannoli to be put in a bag and rung up at the register I get to the register and the coffee isnt ready yet Wow The cannoli wasnt the ricotta cannoli you would get in Philly or New York it was more the icing filling kind Wasnt impressed The other pastries looked good,negative,101,100-150,527,500-1000
They get one star because their pastries are actually tasty and almost worth their expensive prices However the bakery is extremely inconsistent with their supply and their employees lie about when they will have certain items available They have tons of generic cookies and cupcakes available regularly but are always low or out of their specialty italian desserts that I assume most people would particularly go there for One example during my last trip about a week ago I went to the bakery at about 6pm on a Sunday with the intention of getting some cannolis I was told that they ran out and was assured that they would be available again in the morning when they opened at 8am After overhearing my conversation with the employee the customers in line behind me shared their frustration with me that they were there that morning for some cannolis as well and were told to come back in the afternoon I decided to take my chance anyways and made my way again to the Venetian from the other end of the strip to get my cannolis the next morning before I headed home at around 10am Of course when I got there the employee told me that they didnt have any and that they would MAYBE get some in the afternoon The employee seemed annoyed that I even asked for some cannolis while pointing out that there werent any in the display cases Ive been here enough times to know that they often dont even display them and that they have to go get them from the back Horrible customer service what a waste of time,negative,274,250-300,1527,1500-2000
After eating an amazing meal at Bouchon I was excited to grab a snack from Bouchon Bakery a few days later I was actually hoping to try Thomas Kellers variation on the Oreo but they were completely sold out so I instead went with the old standby of an almond croissant It certainly looked the part it was covered in almond slivers and dusted with icing sugar But one bite let me know that things had gone very very awry somewhere along the line Basically the thing was hard as a rock I couldnt even bite through it with my front teeth I had to break off a piece and gnaw on it with my molars Not exactly what youre looking for in a croissant The middle section was a little better as underneath the rockhard exterior was a filling that was pretty tasty But getting there required a Herculean feat of chewing,negative,153,150-200,828,500-1000

I was surprised and completely caught off guard because Buddy gets on people on his shows for the quality of a product I truly hope his original location is not reflected by the Las Vegas location I ordered the cookies and cream and the carrot cake cupcakes and a chocolate chip cookie Both cupcakes were a disaster I cannot believe I stood in line and waited for such a product It is definitely a tourist trap and I was duped as well The cookie was the only edible treat,negative,89,75-100,478,<500
I really wanted to love this place Id heard so much about it NYorkers love this place and I was so happy to finally have one in Vegas Sad to say the cookies and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflakes were strange Flavors were on the savory side I dont mind savory but the cookies were not good at all I took a bite of the 3 Flavors corn compost and cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow All 3 were meh I love sweets but these are not as good as the hype Two stars as the service was good Informative and friendly,negative,102,100-150,534,500-1000
Oh my the sweet smells We walked in the door and the aromas of caramel and popcorn made you immediately want to eat everything in sight  or at least try it And try them we did I sampled Root Beer Float Popcorn White Cheddar and Kettle Corn Dichotomy Kettle Corn and several I have forgotten When I snapped a pic of the room and sent it to my 15 year old she texted back BUY ALL THE POPCORN So we bought four bags Lol Said 15 year old wanted Bacon Cheese Popcorn and the White Cheddar Dichotomy We also took home Root Beer Float and Kettle Corn The only bag that wasnt devoured was the Dichotomy And it still got eaten just not as quickly But back to the shop itself Its so bright and cheery I loved taking a break from walking in the heat We grabbed ice cold waters there and sat and nibbled before heading into our next find I also took the time to find out about he tours they offer Groups of eight for just 5 each and you get a voucher to use before you leave Were planning to get a group together and go soon I did not sample any of he candies this trip but I plan to next time for sure Thanks Campbells for a great first visit we will be back very soon,positive,234,200-250,1193,1000-1500

Almond Croissant  It was hard and over baked I had huge hopes but was very disappointed This must be fluke must be a one time mistake because I saw a picture of one of their half eaten croissants with airy hole pockets But if they had messed up a batch why not just throw it out Where is the quality control It really is not worth tainting their brand name,negative,71,50-75,365,<500
If you would like to go to an average frozen custard place with the trademark response to any issue Sorry cant do much Thats what the system is showing youre at the right place Let me explain I purchased a weekly special parfait 050 off While purchasing I informed the cashier that the amount she was telling wasnt the same amount the drivethrough attendant told me I got the trademark response Without questioning her again I bought it and went on my merry way I wanted to doublecheck the price so I called the next morning asking the regular price and weekly special price for comparison Then I informed the incident to the person over the phone And got a similar response Sorry cant do much now Ill make sure to let others know You might think its only 50 cents Thats not the issue here Its the principle I have worked in the service industry before Some places would above and beyond to keep their customers happy I didnt see such an attitude from this place Quite disappointed tbh I really wanted this place to be my goto custard place  but I guess you cant get everything you want in life,negative,203,200-250,1146,1000-1500
I wanted to like this place after hearing such great things I visited today with my little nieces The dÃcor is nice but service was terrible besides one smiling person The only smiling person I was there for the first time with my nieces trying to give them a unique experience and it wasnt as expected I walked in asked a simple question about which was the beverage  the pastry line  only because someone behind the counter called out  can I help anyone with pastries  I thought maybe there were two lines so I asked politely which one was for pastries I didnt cut the line or assumed where it started  I asked  person behind the counter said if you want pastries you have to stand in line  well duh  I knew that and it wasnt the question The person that helped us wasnt even friendly to my nieces 6 and 7 years of age no smile  no warmness nothing Folks looked at us like we had five heads or like we didnt belong or something I was very disappointed in the way we were treated We were rushed and pushed along like sheep It wasnt super packed although we couldnt sit inside I had to sit outside wind blowing everything everywhere and all I didnt get any service that people on yelp raved about not even my sweet innocent nieces The pastries were ok and way over priced I wont be going back mainly due to the very poor service we received I wont be recommending it to friends or co workers because if your spending your hard earned money in a business the least they can do is fake a smile I was surprised at the attitude and lack of service,negative,302,300- 500,1589,1500-2000
Hokkaido cheese tart and brioche are great The cream puff is not Also one register open with a line out the door Several staffers just go about their business Unfortunately zero points for service here Their should prioritize the customers time,negative,41,25-50,250,<500
When I moved to Charlotte from Chicago I never knew how much baked goods meant to me Until I visited AmÃlies This is the third location Ive visited I love how the quality has remained the same through out The first time I went was with a friend who raved about their macaroons I had to try it Im now addicted I try them everywhere I go AmÃlies has the best macaroons IMO Their iced coffees are strong On one of my visits with my friend we opted to have caramel added to our remade drinks because it was almost on the bitter side Which leads me into customer service They treat you real good here They are willing to go through flavors and heating up your treats when needed I see why people of all ages and walks of life can be found here The relaxing atmosphere and the bomb treats AmÃlies is a must when youre in Charlotte I havent tried their other baked goods but my friends say their awesome Please check them out if youre looking for a treator two,positive,184,150-200,989,500-1000
Our family friend introduced us to Amelies a few years ago when she came by with a box of delectable desserts to cheer my family up while my mom was undergoing chemo for breast cancer That was the first time I had the salted caramel brownie It was perfection not only for the taste and texture but for the uplifting power it had during a difficult time in my life Since then every subsequent trip to Charlotte involves the obligatory stop here Its nice to eat there and takein the French bistro vibe when a table is available but we usually grab and go enjoy in the comfort of my moms house Theres always a line but its good because that gives me time to oogle the display window and decide what else to try along with the salted caramel brownie The macarons are HUGE  more to love and savor Ive also bought some mini tarts to give to friends that I visit in NC or to take back with me to Chi The only snafu Ive experienced here is being accidentally overcharged for a large order of salted caramel brownies The cashier misunderstood and charged me for an extra 4 brownies he also didnt open the box to count himself It was partially my fault for not double checking the bill and correcting it right after However that hasnt stopped me for coming back for more I also love the name which is the same name as my alltime favorite movie,positive,253,250-300,1368,1000-1500
A long time ago we had 15 credit and decided to get some milkshakes They were horrible Very chalky and the chocolate did not have a good flavor and texture So I read that the cookies were the specialty So I use my 15 credit to get four flavors of cookies There were also not appealing in the least The flavors the textures the combinations I have never turned down a cookie in my life and my husband never turns down ice cream We both didnt enjoy either Our family owned an ice cream shop and bakery at one point I watch a lot of food network so was excited to try this place Disappointed,negative,115,100-150,606,500-1000
Saaaaaaweeeeeeeeeeeeeet get your popcorn on They have so many crazy types of flavored popcorn The best is the classic caramel And Im not talking about your old school overly sweet stale Cracker Jack  this is some high quality stuff And if you cant make up your mind they have tasters for each Its like magic in your mouth I went home with a bag of caramel and a caramel apple mmm mmm mmm,positive,74,50-75,407,<500

Honestly dont see why this place is so highly rated The idea is kinda cool and I wanted to like it but I left incredibly disappointed My boyfriend and I ordered the signature Fatty Daddys and werent impressed We actually didnt like the ice cream and thought it lacked flavor It also cost over 8 dollars so it definitely wasnt worth it There is definitely better ice cream shops in the area and I wont be coming back,negative,78,75-100,427,<500

Super disappointed with a recent experience to Bouchon Bakery Having had Bouchon macarons before I thought it would be worth it to drive to the Venetian hotel park and walk through the casino for this tasty little treat I had a friend in town on a short layover and had told her how these were the best tasting macarons I had ever had including our many trips to Paris Unfortunately we must have hit the bakery on leftover day because everything we ordered was STALE At 350 per cookie I expected them to be super fresh and melting in my mouth They were not moist but completely dry and old tasting Two stars because the chai latte was decent,negative,119,100-150,656,500-1000
Extremely unimpressed I did the bakery side for a quick bite and coffee There was one person in front of me and no one after me so I thought this would be a breeze not I ask for a warm croissant and an iced latte I was given the croissant cold and waited for my latte The staff was chatting away without making any drinks and there was no one else in there so I was confused as to why my lattes was taken so long Although the staff could clearly see me waiting no one asked me about it Finally I asked about my latte and turns out they didnt know anything about it Although the person who rang me up was friendly everyone just seemed very inattentive I cant imagine coming here during a busy time if it was this bad with no one else there As far as the food goes the display case really didnt seem so appetizing and just very common over all Nothing about the croissant or coffee stood out I expected more honestly,negative,180,150-200,933,500-1000

Ive seen pictures of this soft serve all of Instagram but located on the east coast I rarely travel in the states let alone across to the east so it would be a long shot before I got to try it We saw it in our hotel while walking around so we had to get it The cashier that helped us was very nice She explained the flavors as well as let us sample them before we decided what we wanted Crack Pie w Corn Flakes Crunch  The crack pie was different It was a brown sugar custard taste but kind of salty It was your salty sweet flavor The corn flakes were everything on this soft serve I loved the crunch and they were not plain They were more like Frosted Flakes by not frosted Birthday Cake w Sprinkles  Corn Flakes  My husband got this and I actually really enjoyed his It tasted like legit birthday cake and the sprinkles were fun Overall this was great especially on a hot day Would it be our first choice Probably not but we would get it again if it was convenient,positive,193,150-200,987,500-1000

This place looks so cute and when I saw the giant donuts in the window I had to have one I asked the lady if their fresh and her response was they get them in everyday that should have been my clue I was so excited about this donut but it was a total let down and waste of money Rock hard no flavor and a waste of 6,negative,69,50-75,324,<500
Came here after a dinner at tornado Im sure this place would be great if you love ice cream since there are so many flavors but I thought the butter pecan I got was average Not as creamymilky as I would have hoped but the staff was super patient and nice and let me sample the flavors I wanted to,positive,60,50-75,302,<500
Pretty sure this donut changed my life  for the much better I LOVE these  Mexican hot chocolate is my favorite I dont know why its better than the regular chocolate or the Nutella but for me it is the best Blood orange is good really liked the blueberry lemon and bc I am a health nut  the Cadbury egg inside the Easter donut Actually scratch all this  the Homer is the best And the fritter Damn just order a dozen and wear your sweats these donuts are amazing I got these for my last birthday instead of a cake Sent my friend down to get the Easter donuts Came for Mothers Day you get the picture The location is great you can go to the vintage stores on Main Street or walk Fremont They have a garden a donut aquarium cute art on the walls nice staff Chef Jeff is usually there OH and banging coffee Ok one thing  they bake their masterpieces in the AM and close the store when they sell out Run dont walk to Donut Bar as their selection winds down as it gets closer to closing  around lunchtime,positive,199,150-200,1036,1000-1500
Great donuts crappy service Called to have an order made for pick up and the woman on phone treated me as if I was unimportant and as if they didnt wish to have me purchase anything Very unfortunate because they have amazing donuts Not sure if Ill be back to purchase any again Maybe get nicerbetter employees Horrible customer service,negative,60,50-75,345,<500

Breakfast every morning Yes please This was our goto spot The chocolate almond croissant and the salted caramel macaron with caramel filling 325 still thinking of it days after was my breakfast for 3 days My husband ordered the ham and cheese croissant heated with a coffee This is a great combo 10 for coffee and sandwich if you enjoy a savory breakfast Everyone is very friendly and there is great outside seating overlooking the Venetian This location has more fresh options as the bakery is positioned with facilities behind it The location on the casino floor gets the day old sandwiches Excellent breakfast staple to start your day,positive,109,100-150,660,500-1000

I stopped by with two friends a couple of weeks ago on a Sat evening Given that we were looking to get together later in the evening for hot beverages or dessert Butterwood fit the bill so we headed over to Lville to check it out Because their specialty is clearly cake and there werent many other desserts in the case we each ordered a slice of cake 6  tax each Going against my usual adventurous streak when it comes to edibles I decided to play it safe and stick with the chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream icing The cake was velvety in texture but not quite as most as I was hoping and it was rather stiff on the iced side As for the icing it was definitely the best part of the cakeit was decadently creamy and rich as buttercream should be My friends ordered the chocolate pistachio cake and the vanilla poppy seed cake and I tried bites of both The cake component of the chocolate pistachio seemed identical to my chocolate cake but the icing was saltier than mine with a rather muted pistachio taste The vanilla poppy seed was the most interesting of the bunch consisting of yellow cake and tangy vanilla icing sprinkled generously with poppy seeds As others have mentioned the slices were rather large such that neither of my friends entirely finished theirs as usual I unabashedly housed my entire slice however If you visit and dont see a cake that youd enjoy Id recommend waiting a bit and checking back given that the cakes seem to rotate By the time that we left all of the cakes thatd been available when we ordered had been replaced by different types of cakes hello Meyer lemon cake The atmosphere is quaint making it an ideal setting in which to relax and catch up over dessert andor hot beverages If youre a night owl andor a fan of dessert I definitely recommend checking it outyour inner Martha Stewart will definitely be pleased,positive,339,300- 500,1915,1500-2000

Its not the best location to have an ice cream cart The top layer is literally melting I felt bad because I took my family and my sister didnt end up getting anything because of the way it looked We ordered 2 waffle cones and 2 Chinese cups and it was almost 26 The ice cream was good but definitely not worth that price point I was really disappointed because I remember it being so much better Also they were very limited on the ice cream flavors,negative,87,75-100,459,<500

It was a Friday evening that we were there having just come from Anthrocon There was a line at this place but all we wanted was a scoop of ice cream The flavors of ice cream were interesting cannoli birthday bash a piece of cake peanut butter cup salted caramel etc lots of melted chocolate lay around for sale as well as empty candy jars with no goods in them despite their labels The ac unit dripped on us a whole bunch when we walked in When I checked in on Yelp it gives you the offer to have a free chocolate covered pretzel So when the time came we waited in line there was only one very stressed young man working he said his coworkers hadnt shown up he hadnt had a break and hed been working all day What gives We got a single scoop of peanut butter cup ice cream in a plain small cone price came out to be around 277 or something like that couldnt remember the number and there was no where the prices for ice cream were listed He didnt recognize the Yelp check in deal but still honored it The pretzel was super stale Pretty not appetizing,negative,205,200-250,1088,1000-1500
Such a cute old school type of ice cream shop They have a ton of flavors  I love that they do a 4 scoop deal for only 425 Great  cost effective way to see what flavors you like My favorites were the mocha almond  the salted caramel Some flavors were just okay like the blue raspberry but overall the flavors were good Dont come here if youre looking to eat inside because its an outside walk up  order type of deal They do have some benches outside though The only downfall to me was their baked goods I got a blondie  it barely had any flavor to it Id say get the ice cream  skip out on any of their baked goods,positive,128,100-150,637,500-1000

Excited to come here  wanted to try everything but I opted for the famous crack pie it was way smaller than I thought  wasnt fresh it was prepackaged The cookie was good but not mind blowing The soft serves were ok but honestly they were way TOO SWEET for our liking My daughter did not even want to finish it because it was too sweet  that is a big deal since kids love all things sweet All in all I think my 30 could have been spent elsewhere,negative,91,75-100,455,<500
Delicious donuts  would highly recommend Due to COVID they are only allowing 1 party enter at a time but at Saturday at 12 PM there was only 1 party ahead of us and we only had to wait about 5 minutes The staff was so friendly and I was happy to see that all the flavors were still available at noon I tried the pumpkin donut and it was amazing,positive,71,50-75,351,<500
Quaint little donut shop starring astonishingly flavorful donuts paired with a small variety of hot and iced coffees French Toast donut comes with berry jelly butter and what I thought to be real maple syrup If it wasnt 100 maple it sure was great quality I dont know if it was the customer service or the highquality ingredients that was the most impressionable Those who love coffee will understand this next statementIt was a bad coffee weekend until I tried the Portland Roast at The Donut Bar Starbucks couldnt even hold their own this weekend Thank you to The Donut Bar for the exquisite flavors genuine helpfulness and friendly experience My favorite bar thus far,positive,115,100-150,691,500-1000
I dont see what all the fuss is about I paid 1150 for a smores and a green iced tea Thats too expensive to me The ice cream and tea are good but not the greatest thing ever The chocolate ice cream tastes like dreyers Theres hardly any fudge sauce The whipped typing is burnt not toasted They only have like six ice cream flavors to choose from Id rather go to baskin robbins or cold stone,negative,77,75-100,401,<500
I love Handels ice cream My friend and I had gone to lunch and decided to stop by to get one of their delicious ice cream cones to top off a nice afternoon When we walked up to the window we saw a woman in the back We waited patiently for her to come up to the window Two more customers walked up My friend knocked on the window to get her attention nothing The other customer also knocked but nothing When they walked away I called the business but it was just an automated machine After waiting 15 minutes we decided to leave Very disappointed with the lack of service Maybe there should be more than one person working behind the counter,negative,123,100-150,655,500-1000
You cant expect any less by Thomas Keller except perhaps when he isnt there himself Thats where his pastry chefs come in At about a quarter past eight the lines were already forming The baked goods looked so fresh and enticing It sure captured my husbands attention as he made his way with stroller in tow to take a peek at the sandwiches A glance at the price tag made him uturn right back I was here and on a mission to have their chocolate bouchons and macarons Packed in pastry boxes for the drive I waited till I got home to enjoy these delights The bouchons will surely be the death of my and thankfully BB is hours away They are deathly good As for the macarons yes its MACARONS not macaroons those coconut things theyre double in size and about double in price Theyre delicate  crisp yet chewy full flavored and made up of good quality ingredients,positive,160,150-200,881,500-1000

This was ridiculously disappointing When I say that Im talking about the food because the staff was totally stellar They were friendly and helpful and I would hire any of them to work for me if I ran a business The food is overpriced trash We have been buying dessert at the Bagel Cafe in Summerlin since we arrived in LV in 2019 and everything weve had there has been incredible so we assumed we were kicking excellence up a notch My wife has loved the Cake Boss since it premiered and has been wanting to try it forever I decided to make it happen for her for Valentines Day this year I went and bought her a 50 gift card and a mug to put it in when I gave it to her She was very excited and ordered one of everything she wanted when we went back for her to redeem the card Unfortunately when we got home and did some sampling the flavors of everything were off Im not sure how to explain it It just didnt taste good Our kids and us all agreed that it was bad Im frustrated that we wasted that money and it was such a letdown for my wife We wont be back again,negative,213,200-250,1086,1000-1500
I walked past the original location in NYC almost 8 years ago and have always regretted not trying their milk cereal soft serve When I saw this location in cos I just had to try it Milk cereal soft serve with fruity pebbles 25 flavor is light but I can definitely taste the sweetness and slight saltiness as if I was finishing a bowl of cereal The texture itself wasnt very creamy and a bit on the icy side chocolate chip marshmallow cookie 35 Love the chewiness of the cookie Tastes like a cross between a cookie and rice crispy treat Not too sweet crispy chunks of corn flakes Pricey Overall spent 12 dollars on a tiny soft serve and a cookie,negative,122,100-150,658,500-1000
SO into Mitchells I immediately had to write about it First and most importantthis ice cream is THE BOMB I know this probably going to sound like a bold statement but it might be the best ice cream Ive ever had At least the best Rocky Road and the best Banana Pie ice cream Ive ever had I did a tasters cup of the two flavors and they paired perfectly together and did my mouth very well Creamy the right amount of flavor and mixins natural banana the artificial stuff is the worst and a good deep chocolate base for the Rocky Road Yes yes yes The staff here is real nice and the gal was very patient as I struggled to pick a flavor its pleasantly overwhelming Tried the two I went with and was sold The space is so cutethe marquee out from repurposed from the old theatre that I think theyve converted to the shop locals dont hold it against me if Im wrong on that The space is really huge with tons of lovely natural light plus communal tables for seating Theres even a row of lower counters and small chairs for kids Behind the counters are huge windows where you can see the ice cream in production Which is pretty neat if youre into that sort of thing which I am Take a pint to go I wish it would last for my 3 hour drive back home and get some of their peanutschocolate sauceetc to go to make your own sundaes at home They also have cakes and cones to take home as well Or just eat in and go to town on their myriad of awesome flavors,positive,284,250-300,1487,1000-1500

Uhh if youre on a diet than dont even think about it Come here early because they run out pretty fast You MUST try their maple bacon and pumpkin They only take cash but seriously you can buy several donuts from the change you will find in your couch Go home eat the mouthwatering donuts weep and then get on that treadmill,positive,62,50-75,335,<500
Donut Bar Vegas was just as good as the one in San Diego and the one that was in Costa Mesa that changed hands Great donuts,positive,26,25-50,124,<500
This place smells so bad for a bakery Youd think as soon as you walk in youll smell fresh pastry but no it smells like gutter Unacceptable,negative,27,25-50,143,<500
I really think this place is overrated the canoli was average and the puff pastry whipped cream was way too sweet I had high expectations and I was let down Everyone has different opinions some love it some of us dont I personally would not go back,negative,47,25-50,254,<500
If you desire being treated rudely this is the place to go I went from being so excited to patronize them to wishing I never set foot in there I can assure you I wont ever again I dont think its necessary to treat a kind customer like dirt on your shoesshameful By the waythis was a geeky dude with glasses and known for his nasty attitude If he is so incapable of being kind helpful or humble as he takes your money which goes toward his paycheck he should be fired,negative,92,75-100,482,<500
Probably the closest thing in AZ that resembles my favorite ice cream place in SoCal Why Because it has the Cookie Monster Though it does turn your mouth blue its worth it The staff is nice and welcoming They got 8 consistent flavors and 4 new flavors every 3 weeks or so The only downfall is the location Parking can be an issue depending on the day and time in addition to the surrounding area Its not the nicest place to be walking by yourself especially at night Otherwise make sure to swing by and get some ice cream,positive,99,75-100,537,500-1000
I have been to Bouchon in NYC Beverly Hills and now Las Vegas in the Venetian I love the Bouchon macarons When I was at the Vegas Venetian the sales clerk told me that if I bought 5 large macarons I would receive a set of 5 mini macarons Great I thoughtI was going to get some for family so I bought 15 large ones expecting 3 sets of minimacs When I got back to my hotel room in another hotel down the strip I realized the sales clerk gave me NO minimacaronsNONE I was going to catch a plane in about 15 hours and to walk back there might have been pretty tight I called over and left a voicemail I expected them to at least call me back but I never heard a word Boy was I sorely disappointed at the customer service I love Bouchon NYC and like LA very much I was a big fan of Bouchon But after this experience I am pretty meh now on the brandno matter how much I liked their macarons Sigh Really disappointed,negative,183,150-200,952,500-1000
By far one of my favorite bakeries around the city Everything is delicious my favorite is their variety of bialies the have to offer Their desserts are not extremely sweet During my morning commute I may pick up breakfast and dessert There is no seating so be prepared to take your treats on the go Next I have to try their pistachio cheesecake,positive,63,50-75,354,<500
What a beautiful donut shop shop is an understatement Its a glamorous display of glutenladen deepfried sugarcoated creatively crafted creations that just dont seem to be fairly priced Those babies should cost at least 50 more The intense labor and attention to detail explains the wicked narrow window of when it is open I empathize with the time demands and being a slave to crafting such treats so its cool to limit hours Otherwise they would sacrifice worker sanity donut quality and artistic freedom to the confines of clock time Anyhow they have vegan donuts I repeat they have vegan donuts Not the kind that you see and think oh those are the vegan ones Oh no you wouldnt even care they are vegan or even know the difference dear donut aficionados Though Judy there one day of the 4 vegan choices 3 looked amazingly divine and all looked just like the rest Strawberry split Apple fritter Creme brÃlÃe Who doesnt want those if you are going to eat a glutenladen donut Truly beautiful donuts I also love that they have some esteemed coffee here to compliment the divine donuts Stumptown baby The line is long but worth the wait Everyone is happy here from staff to customers The decor has an oldfashioned feeling to harken back to days when people didnt care about carbs as bad for the diet and brain I love that they put your treats in an open box until they ring you up on the register A must try if you eat donuts with gluten truly beautiful artistic creations Youll be so happy,positive,268,250-300,1551,1500-2000
This is the best ice cream We used to get it mail ordered to us from Ohio The flavors are so unique and we just love the texture of their ice cream When you walk in one employee is hand making waffle cones There isnt much to say about this place except about how amazing it is,positive,57,50-75,285,<500
The minicupcakes are cute and taste sweet but the vanilla has a strange aftertaste from the frosting The black and white is good though Meanwhile their ice creams capn  crunch salted caramel cherry vanilla are all atrocious Ive literally never tasted ice cream this bad The salted caramel just tastes like salt the cap n crunch is crappy soggy peanut butter mush and the cherry vanilla just tastes like a bad imitation of Ben and Jerrys The worst by far is not using the berry cap n crunch Holsteins and Momofuku is much better,negative,95,75-100,545,500-1000
I was excited to try this new ice cream shop since its walking distance from my house They mix cereals into their ice cream I wasnt too interested in trying that but did have cookies and cream mixed in with a little chocolate syrup as a topping The ice cream is sickening sweet  I couldnt finish it Worst ice cream Ive ever eaten They are expensive also They werent busy on a Friday night  now I know why,negative,80,75-100,418,<500
Disappointed as they dont have any regular vanilla cupcakes made today Youd think they would have the basic cupcake on a Saturday I would think it would be the most popular cupcake for sales but apparently not Missed sales opportunities,negative,40,25-50,244,<500
This is a nice place for gathering with friends at nights They have some kind of pastry which I like the most and I go there to get that each time The staff are nice and the atmosphere is enjoyable Update its been a few months that you have to wait in a long line to get the service The line sometimes is more than 70 people and they only have one cashier So you should wait for about an hour just in the line I am not going there anymore,negative,91,75-100,457,<500
Plastic wrapped cookies and five dollar jars of dry cereal We tried the compost and marshmallowwhatever cookies and you really just taste sugar above the other flavorings I am still going to try the original Milk in NYC because grabbing the cookies when they are fresh baked is probably a completely different experience,negative,53,50-75,324,<500
Literally was already in the door at 1100pm There was a line of 4 people ahead of me and 34 people behind me 3 of the employees looked at us as we came in After a couple minutes one of their female employees came from the back room and kicked out my group and the group behind me and said the line ends here hand motion to cut off my group I understand they want to be closed at exactly 11pm but most businesses will not turn away customers once theyre already in the door especially since it isnt a sit down full service place Instead of kicking people out once they are situated inside have a staff member at the front door apologizing courteously that we are closed The way the employee did it was so rude that customers that were enjoying their dessert outside noticed the employees behavior and said If the owner was here they wouldnt be happy about that,negative,163,150-200,880,500-1000
I had the cinnamon cupcake and chocolate chip cookie cupcake Both were really good though I thought the price was a bit steep Service was good Great location,positive,28,25-50,162,<500

Was so excited to eat one of Buddys cannolis it was nothing special The cannoli left a funny coating in your mouth maybe the grease from the deep fryer I tried a chocolate meringue OMG it was so hard at 820 in the morning nearly broke a tooth no joke The cupcakes red velvet and the flower one was no big deal The Cupcakery and Give Me Sugar make better onesI did like the pecan wedge dipped in chocolate it was very good and the apple turn over The Cannoli tower was expensive and had NO flavor Spent 3600 for blah pastries I am a local I spread the word on good food I was an avid diner of Max Brenners dining there once a week because it was good and unique I took everyone I knew who came to town there Sadly ceasers did not renew their lease so they closed Thought Carlos would take its place but it wont My husband wants to buy our 30 wedding anniv cake their but I am not sure Maybe he should have brought the staff from Carlos to Vegas for training The staff also was very disorganized calling our number 5 times each time I told them I had been helped They were not busy Monday morning at 820 am also did not have Lobster tails that is what I went there for Cannoli and Lobster tails I love Cake Boss and all the shows Buddy but Carlos bakery was a Huge disappointment Wont be back sorry I am a local and am always trying new places and when its good everyone will hear about it This was not Staff didnt even know how to make coffee in the automatic brewers felt bad for the guy behind uslove Buddy but not the bakery I took tons of photos for my facebook page but they looked better than they tasted so sad,negative,320,300- 500,1696,1500-2000
I just adore sprinkles I live in California where we have them around a lot this one is pretty small but its really cute  the staff was very sweetmy favorite is the sugar free red velvetI am not a cupcake or sweets person but when it comes to their red velvet cupcakes I could eat like 10 The cream cheese frosting is deliciousthey also have mini cupcakes in case you want to try a few different kinds,positive,78,75-100,412,<500
This review is solely based on my experience with a worker named Maura I am a frequent outofstate visitor to Cleveland and I always make a point to stop by Prestis What a mistake yesterday I had the unfortunate and unpleasant experience of being waited on by Maura What a poor example of customer service I was trying to give her two cannoli orders  one two chocolate and two regular and one order of one chocolate and one regular When I tried to give her both orders she only let me give her one at a time because she might forget A young girl should not have difficulty in remembering something as simple as this Then she brought back the first order of 4 cannolis which were to be a gift to someone all crammed in to a small plastic box when all the other servers were placing them nicely in Prestis boxes trust me I know this because I had to wait 30 minutes in line in a hot crowded building When I asked for a cardboard box she rolled her eyes and then made fun with another worker Laugh laugh laugh After this she decides that she has to write down my order and every time she got one more thing she had to ring it up on the cash register What should have been a 5 minute order took 15 minutes at least At the end of the order she put the receipt on top of the counter and walked away I signed it took my copy and started to leave until I was accosted by Maura about where was the receipt I said I had left it on top of the counter Well its not there Perhaps if she would have paid attention instead of walking away she would be more on top of these things It is not a customers job to make sure she has her receipts While I was bagging up my items she said something again about the receipt and once again I said I did not have it to which she responded It was only a question Other things went on with this person that does not show Prestis in a positive light She was snarky and rude and would be fired in a second if she were my employee,negative,390,300- 500,1998,1500-2000
Disappointed No sugar free flavor available and employee just said no when I asked if nutritional information was available Expected more The vegan mango sorbet was just ok,negative,28,25-50,178,<500
Every time weve gone to Vegas there has been a 3060 minute wait to get in so I always pass by I was thrilled when I saw there was no line one day I bought a yellow cupcake with chocolate frosting The cupcake was dry and void of flavor The frosting tasted as if it were made from Crisco I threw most of it away and wont go back,negative,69,50-75,337,<500
This is the second time that we have been to Jenis The ice cream here is pretty good but they make fresh waffle cones that you can smell down the street My favorite is the brambleberry crisp but they have a number of good flavors I havent tried any others as I stick to my favorites This is a cool little place that has a line almost any time of day The lines go pretty quickly so dont be discouraged I really enjoy Jenis and stop here anytime that I am in the area,positive,94,75-100,476,<500
The food is definitely decent if gimmicky Its gone downhill from where it used to be certainly And they used to be really good about being aware of what allergens were in which items but not anymore I got an item with surprise coconut on my most recent visit luckily my allergy isnt life threatening You REALLY dont want to go on a weekend night because the lines are insane If it were still what it once was it would be worth the hype but those days are gone,negative,89,75-100,477,<500
What a disaster This place does not live up to the hype The pastries were dry coffee just soso and the service was clueless The Uptown location tries to be lively and hip but it comes off as plastic and busy Better places to spend my time and s,negative,49,25-50,254,<500
The pink Milk sign is what caught my eye initially I was in the mood for something sweet after dinner at the Cosmopolitan Hotel and decided to grab dessert from Milk There are a ton of options to chose from but I was personally in the mood for a soft serve so I went ahead with the cereal milk flavor with the corn flakes topping Its definitely not a typical flavor but it literally does taste exactly like milk and cereal They had two other flavors one was crack pie and the other was a chocolate something which were a little too sweet in my opinion Ill go ahead and grab a milkshake next time,positive,115,100-150,604,500-1000
I like the Vegan Ice creamits so delicious The staff is always so personable and helpful They also a very nice upper level area that we have used in the past for events The window where we can watch the workers in action making the ice cream is always a treat to watch especially for younger kids who are intrigued by how things are made Its a great spot for families to have a delicious homemade treat Its a great asset to the West 25th Business Community I only wish there was a location on the West Park Neighborhood area,positive,100,75-100,534,500-1000
An odd location but if youre going to drive to get ice cream anyway I appreciate the nonstandard flavors I tried Cinnamon Toast Crunch which needed some help not cinnamony enough And tried the Capn Crunch which was well done and surprising As you see I went with two cereal flavors I tried the nutella but it was a bit too bland so went with the above The ice cream is good A very smooth texture and sweet I didnt not try the sundae with a macarone and marshmallow not hungry enough Definitely worth trying but I felt the flavors needed to pop a little more and realize Im comparing this to the best ice cream Ive had in this country,positive,121,100-150,664,500-1000
I didnt rush to try this place since I dont like matcha but we had lunch in the area so we decided to stop by They have so much more than just matcha They had us sample all their ice cream flavors and I loved hojicha and black sesame It was the first time Ive seen either of these in Charlotte We decided to get the Maiko Special with a vanilla hojicha ice cream swirl Overall I loved it It had a matcha cake in it that I actually liked It also had a special matcha ice cream in it which I really didnt like but was able to avoid They use the same waffle cones as Jenis which I love I tried some of my friends black sesame waffle cone which was great Warning the hojicha and matcha products have caffeine in them It makes sense if you think about it but I forgot since I was just eating dessert and it kept me up half the night I dont drink caffeine The decor is really well done The service is incredibly friendly I will be back but will probably stick to black sesame next time to avoid the caffeine,positive,201,200-250,1030,1000-1500
A cute little cupcake shop located on the promenade being the Linq Hotel  Casino The cupcakes are tasty and they have a cupcake ATM for your after 1am sugar craving,positive,31,25-50,167,<500
Just okdont believe the hype because its pretty much all hypewe pretty much ordered one of everything and werent impressed by any of it,negative,24,<50,143,<500
Eh very overpriced for what You get Soft serve is decent Consistency is fine but not creamy luxurious Flavor of cereal milk is as expected Also got a cookie and the crack pie Easy on the sugar Mouth puckering sweetness overwhelms anything else but what I could taste was pretty pedestrian Crack pie slice was also small and thin not that I would want more but for the price Even my kid who is an unabashed sweet tooth dessert guy didnt want another bite Place is bright and good for pics and service is efficient but definitely style over substance,negative,100,75-100,568,500-1000
We ordered a cookies and cream cake and Italian cheesecake The cake was very bland just sugar tasting The cake wasnt moist for 10 a slice I expected a much better cake The Italian cheesecake was not much better A very soggy crust ,negative,44,25-50,238,<500
CRACK PIE  Smaller than I thought it would be for 6 It was definitely good but I dont think Id buy it again and I dont think Id have enjoyed it as much if my friend hadnt hyped it up for me Im afraid I cant justify the size for its price It came in a envelope box given at the register CEREAL SHAKE  10 Not certain because I didnt purchase it myself Definitely a heavy drink with all the milk but I couldnt stop drinking it The cereal was perfectly crunchy throughout even at the bottom of the cup Id get it again but only to share with someone Shared with my boyfriend EXPERIENCE  Small line when I went around midnight on a weekday but it went by quick and we didnt wait long for the shake to come out Cute photo op with a pink milk light stand in front but its low to the ground which might make it difficult to get an easy shot Overall Id come back to try the other items but based on the price point Id prefer to make it an experience dessert by sharing with my boyfriend or friends to diffuse the cost Originally wanted to give 3 stars but if Ive enjoyed the experience or food enough to want to come back its at least a 4 Definitely recommend trying a variety of items to see if the price point is worth it in terms of quality quantity or experience,positive,253,250-300,1311,1000-1500
Get a Southside Shake with hot fudge shake and peanut butter sundae on top  absolutely amazing,positive,17,<50,96,<500
People rave about this bakery Only 2 people allowed in at a time You must wear a mask We bought many things 2 chocolate cookies a small sprinkle cookie a piece of carrot cake a somemore bar a Sfingi cream puff and a lemon bar I asked for an oatmeal cookie also but it was not in our bag but we werent charged for it either The total came to 3299 with tax and a tip All of it was dry not sweet at all and overdone No one finished their treat even the 3 year old The small frosted cookie with sprinkles tasted like it has anise it This bakery reminds me of an English bakery taste We ended up liking the lemon bar and carrot cake best There were at least 10 people waiting outside to take their turn to go inside So many people do appreciate the less sweet dry taste,negative,154,150-200,787,500-1000
I was not impressed but was shocked by the prices RIDICULOUS I guess they assume you have extra money to throw around since youre in LV Anyhow loved the lobster tails besides the excessive amount of filling The cannolis where not great The lb of cookies was 1695 I think Cupcakes 350 ea I didnt not expect to pay so much for pastries To top it off we stood in a LONG ASS line to order and when i was called to pay and pick up i was told my order of cannolis was taken Wtf How does that happen Its called shitty customer service and a waste of time I saw a pregnant lady leave upset I would be too if i was pregnant with a craving Seriously avoid this place unless you wany to give it a try You were warned I will try to post up picture of receipt,negative,152,150-200,770,500-1000
Much better than Champaigns Jarlings Better service better ice cream and the lines usually significantly shorter Worth the drive,positive,19,<50,135,<500

Chef Thomas Keller has created little holes in the Venetian filled with sweet and savory items to pick up and take away There are two bakeries one across the Venetian Theatre underneath the escalators and another street side by the Strip Like I said little holes in the Venetian I am a fan of Chef Thomas Keller and have been to French Laundry in Napa as well as his Bouchon Restaurant several times and little bakeries in the Venetian Like I said I am a fan I have never been disappointed with his food baked items or service in any establishments Everything in these little bakeries are baked in the restaurant and brought down daily You really cannot go wrong with whatever you choose I have chosen several over the years from cupcakes cookies croissants sandwiches macrons etc You name it I have probably ingested it For sweets the cupcakes are a favorite of mine because they change with the season If you go during the holidays you will find fun holiday themed pastries Coffee is also served at Bouchon bakeries so you can grab a coffee and pastry to go any time of the day You may need to check the hours because Bouchon Bakery is not open 247 but they are open early in the morning Enjoy your Bouchon,positive,221,200-250,1238,1000-1500
This is such a local gem Everyone from the 217 knows this place as a symbol of their childhood The crazy lines are part of the experience Use it as an opportunity to observe the townies were interesting people You have to pick a side though are you going to call it Jarlings or Custard Cup Cold fudge is their specialty and yeah it really is better cold,positive,68,50-75,365,<500
I had a serious craving for macarons after my friends and I were talking about sweets so when I found out there was a Bouchon bakery at the Venetian I made my friend go with me to get some 350 each for macarons sound steep but theyre huge Each one is as big as the palm of my hand I got the chocolate pistachio and vanilla and all tasted divine We also had iced mochas that were good I liked that they werent too sweet I made the mistake of drinking the whole thing though and I got a crazy caffeine high I wish I got more Now Im going to have to go to LA just to get some ,positive,121,100-150,596,500-1000
Ive been going to Prestis for years so Thanksgiving weekend provided the perfect time to stop in We had dined at Trattoria and walked down the street to Prestis on Friday night We wanted to order both pastries and coffee which you had to do in two separate lines I waited for the pastries and ordered for a couple of people When I asked if the pastries could be put in separate boxes the lady behind the counter seemed to get huffy with me When I paid I was holding my adorable four month old niece so she seemed to chill out I got the pumpkin cheesecake on this visit and it was fantastic Im glad to see that Prestis is still thriving after so many years,positive,127,100-150,674,500-1000
Disappointed I have been eating sprinkles cupcakes since the beginning This red velvet had to be the most dry cupcake Ive ever had I can guarantee it wasnt made today I dont know whats going on but sprinkles has gone down hill as it has spread the country Cupcakes have gotten dry smaller  the quality just isnt what it used to be The icing was even slightly hard So sad,negative,71,50-75,385,<500
I totally devoted an afternoon to trying to find this place It is not easy to find Especially when the hotel is under construction and the signs in the hotel kind of suck I eventually found it behind the escalator Its a tiny counter reminiscent of a Starbucks inside of a grocery store or airport I hoarded my cappuccino maracrons They had a buy 5 get a 6th free special going on Score I carried my babies in my hand onto the airplane and put them under the seat Then I ate them all The end,positive,96,75-100,504,500-1000

Jarlings is easily one of the most famous establishments in all of CU There is always an absolutely gigantic line to get the frozen treats they provide Though I dont go often because of the aforementioned long lines I always enjoy their custard and the general experience of going to Jarlings Ill keep stopping inas long as the lines arent long Definitely a mustgo when youre in CU,positive,68,50-75,400,<500
One of the worst places Ive ever been to in my entire life Espresso is rancid and the top of it was wiped with a dirty rag When I asked for a new clean cup it was my pleasure to be served with abject rudeness and contempt All courtesy of the young boy behind the counter with the overdyed bleached hair Thank you for treating me with same courtesy as you treat all your black customers Im sure With nothing but contempt,negative,82,75-100,431,<500
One of two cupcake shops that my picky husband likes Online ordering and curbside pickup won me over 5 Stars,positive,20,<50,111,<500
Multiple people have raved about this place so I was very disappointed with the experience This is what we ordered Napoleon Is there ice cream in this How about some flavor Blech Key lime pie tart Eh pretty bland Caramel apple cake Cooked a few weeks ago I think Soooo dry and bland Bread pudding Is this pudding or cake Again outrageously dry Also a 20minute line Ha And a font for menu items that I cant read Ill never come here again Way overrated They did offer free refills on coffee which was nice,negative,95,75-100,531,500-1000
Masons I wish I could quit you but with the ever changing menu I have to return way more often than I should admit Ive had sooo many different flavors here and none of them have ever disappointed me Besides the fact that the ice cream is highquality and delicious its just fun to be able to try something different every time I stop by I always just get a couple of scoops to try the flavors but they do have more elaborate options on the menu including ice cream sandwiches and egg wafels The shop itself is pretty tiny and staffed with some of the nicest servers you could ask for Theres almost always a decent line but it moves pretty quickly and Ive never had trouble finding a place to sit down and enjoy my tasty treat They also have a wall on the back where customers can suggest new flavors so let then know if you have any ideas,positive,162,150-200,863,500-1000
Ice cream is bomb Especially the bourbon caramel toffee crunch and honey lavender flavors Oh and the donut sandwich is quite ridiculous My only regret is stuffing my face with too much pizza at a pizza joint beforehand so I didnt do such a great job making room for more scoops of ice cream goodness Then again my tummy wouldve disowned me Staff is super friendly and genuinely happy to be there Will definitely be back to try more of their decadent flavors,positive,83,75-100,469,<500
Still only drive thru open Customers cant even sit in their cars in the parking lot to enjoy their ice cream Who wants to wait until home to eat ice cream Last time I checked ice cream melts Stupid rules and its the end of May,negative,46,25-50,234,<500
Shocking that this place has 4 12 stars They are not only pricey but their scoops are so small When press the ice cream in the cup its half the size of the cup Some of their flavors like captain crunch and habanero mango might be different but they are not good at all This was our first time here but definitely our last Frost is the place to go,negative,70,50-75,355,<500
Really cool ice cream shop I love the Chinese takeout boxes the ice cream is put in and the fortune cookie provided with it Try to sample as many flavors as you can before making a decision Great place to bring a friend or two Cant hurt to visit,positive,49,25-50,251,<500
The customer service sucks They overcharged my food when I only bought 4 items and not 6 When I went to get a refund they charged me again instead of refunding the money they owe me back I once again have to go back in the store to ask for a refund and finally this time I ask them to refund it with dollar bills instead of doing it through a card which they did If you do indeed go here and buy their food make sure to check your receipt so you dont get overcharged,negative,96,75-100,475,<500
I am putting this out there I feel like I am totally out of place by only rating them a 45 This could be because I have only tried two thingsso far I walk in to expect a super overwhelming packed store It was not Point for Batch I did not expect the amount of variety in absolutely everything I read the reviews so I thought I was prepared Man I had to walk by about 5 times to officially decide and determine my order I finally decided on the apple pie 375 and the caramelized onion focaccia 4 I ate the pie in my carI could not wait to take it home The pie was full of cinnamon a denser crust and lots of apples It tasted ok It tasted like a pie I think I was so hyped that I expected the pie beyond pies I am glad to know another place where I can get pie but it also makes it very tempting to try and perfect my own apple pie and save almost 400 Again do not get me wrong it is a good pie but was not OMG good The focaccia was good That one did make it home and the sig other actually enjoyed it and he is picky I like onions I think a cheese on top would have made it Super Duper focaccia but at that point does that still mean it is focaccia or closer to a sandwich Either way it was good I will for sure be going back to try the endless supply of goodies I am still in search of my OMG pie but this pie would do for a good eat,positive,284,250-300,1381,1000-1500
I like Milk Bar but its all hype and not enough bang for your buck I believe Milk Bar originates from NYC and is a progenitor of this cereal trend along with Kith and is a welcome addition to the Cosmopolitan Like everything else at the Cosmopolitan its also overpriced Thats not to say it isnt good Milk Bar does have some very solid items from their cookies to their milkshakes but Ive got to say that it doesnt fulfill the craving When you want a milkshake you want a heavy completely guilty item that makes you feel like youve made a terrible mistake but at least your wallet isnt hurting Here youll get something that doesnt quite fulfill the craving doesnt feel guilty and hurts your wallet Not exactly my ideal milkshake or dessert option Its still definitely worth trying and the 12 spiked milkshakes are almost fair priced even if downed in basically a minute 3 cookies sound a bit much but cookies are generally expensive if youre not getting some cheap grocery option At the same time you can get like 50 cookies from Safeway for like 5 so you should also consider that Milk Bar will be a welcome addition but definitely not something Ill get every day when Im in Vegas or even once a trip TIP Get a spiked milkshake because at least alcohol is always overpriced in Vegas,negative,235,200-250,1329,1000-1500
Lets get to the point they do the chocolate business wonderfully My gotos are the hot fudge sundae and their hot chocolates The hot fudge sundae is absolutely amazing The ice cream is wonderful but the hot fudge on top of it is the star My recommendation is getting it with hot dark chocolate fudge as it is silky and has a hint of sweetness which pairs well with the already sweet vanilla ice cream It does not have the bitterness of most dark chocolates but instead has a deep flavor to it that is satisfying with the ice cream The hot chocolate is divine as well The smooth creamy blend of chocolate is indulgent but not overpowering My favorite flavor is the sea salt hot chocolate With the sweetness of the chocolate and caramel within the drink the notes of sea salt in each sip enhances the chocolate and caramel notes while also giving a flavor other than sweet that the drink needs I will definitely be back to try their other desserts,positive,174,150-200,964,500-1000
It looks like Im in the minority here but I didnt think Bouchons macarons were anything approaching good Theyre large for sure about the size of the palm of my hand and reasonably priced at 350 each No creative flavors available  just the classics of chocolate caramel coffee vanilla pistachio  raspberry The large cookie size meant that the ratio of shell to filling was way off too much cookie and my raspberry was a tad stale Service was pretty crap too  the attendant couldnt have been more disinterested Honestly its my fault  who buys a French pastry in an Italianthemed casino Lesson learned,negative,107,100-150,627,500-1000
A fantastic bakery that makes gourmet cupcakes and cake slices Beautifully decorated Overall cakes moist Flavors are unique some great combinations while others not so much Overall would make great gifts to bring to large gatherings but forewarned to get your blood sugars checked and a safe place to nap for that postsugar crash vegan lavender cake with agave buttercream  bits of savory floral saltiness in one bite Strong lavender flavor one of my favorite blood orange with priickly pear buttercream  tasty couldnt quite taste the blood orange or prickly pear aspects coconut cake with macha buttercream  definitely one of their most flavorful combinations Mild rich on the palate light on the stomach Would highly recommend this cake earl grey with honey buttercream  cake was a bit dense and dry Honey buttercream although aesthetcially appealing was not very flavorful Tones of earl grey flavor stand out strongly However would not recommend this poppy rose with fig cream  fantastic incredibly moist cake The rose flavor stands out strongly very floral I very much enjoyed this cake chocolate can with maple sweet potato cream  rich a bit heavy Not for the faint of heart,positive,198,150-200,1220,1000-1500
Very disappointed I love this place so much and come on a weekly basis and have never had an experience like we had tonight Im 9 months pregnant and we were out celebrating our wedding anniversary so we wanted to go to our favorite ice cream spot as a night cap We arrived at 930pm with a small wait which was expected on a Friday night But what I was not expecting was how unfriendly the worker was towards us We happened upon an unpleasant and displeased employee right from when we walked up to the window on the very far right which was by 950 I asked 2 questions to clarify and all he seemed was irritated and kept closing the door on our faces like he was dismissing us I ended up just ordering 2 quarts to go because I felt so uncomfortable and just wanted to leave My husband encouraged me to speak up because I was wanting to try something new so I tried to order one additional thing by the time he even got back to us which was at 1001 He rolled his eyes and denied me service because I wasnt allowed to order it once they were closed Even with other people still in line ordering what I had tried to add on to my order Maybe if he wasnt so rude from the beginning I would have actually been able to enjoy my anniversary dessert but this completely dampened the night and put a bad taste in mouth because of the customer service,negative,261,250-300,1373,1000-1500
Goddamn I miss this place Cold Stone Creamery has got nothing on Custard Cup I have so many awesome memories of friends and family gathering here on hot summer days and nights The only bummer was that it would shut down at the end of the season and wed have to go without these delicious treats for a whole 6 months Smart choice on their part Because as soon as those doors opened at the beginning of each summer the line never ended til the end of Sept,positive,88,75-100,461,<500
Honestly I feel like I set my expectations too high for this place since Ive been watching cake boss for as long as I can remember and actually eating it was such a disappointment My mom  I were both disappointed because its not what was expected Anyways they put too much egg in the pastries especially the lobster tails it has such a strong smell of egg  it makes you not want to finish it The cannolis are okay they just need to work on making the filling less grainy,negative,92,75-100,482,<500
So disappointed It was my must go place when I visit California so I was very excited vegas finally has one After a very long wait I got a box full of bread But filling inside the bread was not soft or creamy Instead it was hard like a meltaway peppermint candy,negative,52,50-75,268,<500
Very yummy place I got the one for regular price get one for a dollar special yesterday Strawberry matcha is delicious as usual The rose latte was something new I wanted to try It was good but my only complaint is it wasnt sweet enough for me 75 sweet It has a beautiful floral taste and the sweet element a was mostly concentrated in the pink layer Still very yummy just learned my lesson to make it a little sweeter next time since the rose flavor is very delicate,positive,89,75-100,478,<500
The drip coffee is pretty good The chia latte is wonderful according to my wife The salted caramel brownie is terrific The attitude we received when we ordered SUCKED  My coffee was a 14 empty I asked for it to be topped off and the snotty girl still didnt fill it up If it were gas station coffee and were cheap it would not be a big deal However when you drop over 15 and youre treated like your inconviencing an employee its unacceptable,negative,85,75-100,455,<500
I was really bummed that I didnt get a chance to check this place out when I was visiting NYC as this place is mentioned in pretty much every article that goes something like 25 things you must eat before you die in NYC So I was thrilled to find out that a location opened in Vegas a place where I visit much more frequently than NYC Turns out that I wasnt missing out much I tried the cereal milk soft serve w cereal crunch crack pie compost cookie cornflake marshmallow cookie and corn cookie Cereal milk soft serve was nice it wasnt too sweet and it indeed tasted like milk where cereal had been soaked in But its not something that I would crave again Crack pie  Sadly this pie did not live up to its name at all It was dry on the outside mushy on the inside and sickeningly sweet Just imagine what baked butter with a crap ton of sugar would taste like Yep All the cookies  Super dry  way too sweet Not to mention that all of these items are overpriced Soft serve  crack pie were both 6  the cookies were something like 3 each All in all the soft serve is worth trying once Dont bother getting the pie or the cookies,negative,223,200-250,1167,1000-1500
 5 stars Love Ghirardelli Chocolates  what a treat My favorites are Ghirardelli with salted caramel What a dream come true to visit this place Ghirardelli is located inside the The LINQ Promenade The shop is on your left as you are walking towards the LINQ Ferris wheel When you walk in the shop the worker hands you a sample 0 There are tons of chocolates many many varieties The chocolates are by the lb  I didnt buy any chocolates as the package ones at the store comes out cheaper  the flavors I love is available by the packs After our dinner we stopped here for some sweets Everything looks so good I had a very hard time deciding  finally end up ordering the Banana Split This is perfect as we were still celebrating our anniversary 2915 As I was eating our banana split it brought back memories of my high school days when I worked  ice cream shop This was the last time I ever had a banana split The Banana Split is huge you can also pick your 3 choice of ice cream  topping My choices for BS were 2 scoops espresso  1 strawberry with crushed almonds strawberries  caramel toppings The price close to 1000 but thats ok its our anniversary  we are on vacation It was worth it I feel guilty that Im eating this wout the kids esp my son he Loves sweets Nexts time I will bring my kiddies Cant wait yay loveghirardelli It was fun sitting outside having our banana split,positive,266,250-300,1463,1000-1500
Very disappointing Not that I am a cupcake expert by any means but I am a cupcake lover to the extremeso much so I actually began running half marathons just so I can justify eating more cupcakes That being said I was SO excited to try Sprinkles I have to say that the cupcakes at Smiths grocery store are better I bought the red velvet coconut chocolate marshmallow chocolate and the pumpkin cupcakes to split up between my husband and I The chocolate cupcakes were very dry and stale and tasted like the cocoa in the batter was low quality The pumpkin and red velvet were a little better to the taste but not by much For 1 cupcake its 375 and for a four pack its 15 I feel thoroughly ripped off I wouldve given Sprinkles 1 star except for the store and through staff hospitality were wonderful Too bad the product stinks worse than my husbands big toe Will not be returning again,negative,165,150-200,914,500-1000
Donuts looked really good I only tried one of them so far was not wowed I would go back because there was other ones that might be better,negative,28,25-50,137,<500
I ordered a birthday cake from them and it was very bad It is a very huge thing for me to not like cakes as I can literally like anything that is sweet Firstly it was such a huge disappointment as none of the guests ate the cake and after some time they didnt even bother trying it also It was very very dry that once you start cutting the cake it all just fell apart and the frosting was very thick and has no taste whatsoever NEVER EVER BUY CAKES FROM THIS PLACE,negative,94,75-100,470,<500
He crack pie is amazing Imagine eating a buttered piece of brown sugar cooked perfectly It is a wonderful decadent treat,positive,21,<50,124,<500
The best ice cream I have ever eaten Ive been coming here now for a few weeks thanks to some friends and I regret not coming sooner Im actually not really suppose to eat ice cream because of some dairy problems but surprisingly enough this place doesnt cause any issues Probably because its REAL and delicious I normally get the graham central station x4 and my boyfriend gets the 4 scoop sampler with all the cheesecake options WE LOVE THIS PLACE SO MUCH Now I will say the lines are a bit ridiculous at times but all the aggravation goes away when you take that first scoop and it melts in your mouth This will now be my go to dessert spot and Ive told all my family and friends If youve seen this place and havent stopped by yet DO IT NOW Especially for the 2 buck Tuesdays,positive,149,100-150,798,500-1000
Stumbled across this spot walking through downtown Phoenix one evening The staff there was very helpful with answering questions about flavors and let you have samples And o boy This ice cream is very good Probably jumped straight to top of my favorite phoenix spot above other power houses,positive,49,25-50,295,<500
First time visit  Awesome little place to get a quick little ice cream scoop or two It an easy order and everything is self explanatory which is great Definitely worth it  Thanks again April,positive,36,25-50,195,<500
First time here Dont get the milkshake its super watery I went with the coffee flavor and I ended up throwing it away after 2 sips The soft serve looked good,negative,31,25-50,163,<500
My wife would say this is delicious and we better than she imagined it could be Long line brief wait but way worth it We got the lobster tails and they are the best Ive ever had The price was a little more than anticipated however thats just because I didnt even know how much it would cost Flavor wise it was worth it You did good Buddy You did good,positive,71,50-75,365,<500
Milk bar did not live up to my expectations The cake was pretty goodjust way too sweet Cookies were disappointing and didnt taste fresh The soft serve was ok I think 14 slice of cake should be the best thing I have ever had for dessert and this just wasnt it Cute shop and location though,negative,56,50-75,300,<500
I was excited when i saw this place in Vegas First time i had sprinkle cupcake was when i visited NYC last year Heard and seen pictures of the Cupcake ATM and finally up close and personal My cousin used the ATM for cupcake and I decided to go inside and get the Sprinkle Sundae It consist of your choice of a cupcake and ice cream They half the cupcake and put ice cream in the middle I got the carrot cupcake w coconut almond fudge ice cream It was so good My cousin thought her cupcake was too sweet I thought mine was moist and delicious,positive,107,100-150,552,500-1000
I just went to Melt  the guy did not use gloves or use a TISSUE at least when he got the donut for my friend Thats gross He had a cold sore on his lip and those are very contagious Me and my friends even think he didnt wash his hands from how fast he got back with the donut Not sorry for writing this review just watching out for future customers,negative,73,50-75,358,<500
Super creamy and delicious Also good quality with affordable price Love it A place that can come over and over again,positive,21,<50,119,<500
Ive never really had a good experience with Hopscotch in the past so decided to give it another go after winning a gift card from a game night However I do like the idea and the location and its nice to have a bakery in town like this First thing to know though is the staff is generally rude and if you have questions  lord help you because theyll either act like youre dumb or act like their life is ruined by you asking anything Second thing to know  DO NOT ORDER COFFEE Just dont  it tastes sour  somehow Just go somewhere else Third do not get bakery items such as cakes or muffins will 100 always be dry I recommend the lemon bar or bread pudding when its available The ambiance is really cute but I think thats what draws people They also sell fun little things like notebooks stickers and even kitchen supplies which are great for gifts Their website is also user friendly right now due to Covid but remember you cannot go in and browse Overall it was exactly as expected Mediocre quality and a cute aesthetic,negative,195,150-200,1048,1000-1500
Dont get a milkshake until they figure out that the tiny straws that they provide dont work Got my milkshake 30 minutes to go and I have yet to get anything out of it On top of them convincing me to get a monster shake Just the lack of thinking on their part deserves this one star ORDER BIGGER STRAWS,negative,60,50-75,308,<500
Based on the two mornings I went to The Donut Bar I can say they have amazing presentation but the basics are lost in the details For example this morning I had the fritter with bacon the bacon was high quality and perfect but the fritter was so done the edges were almost black I could only eat the center of it Yesterday I had an Old Fashion and a Strawberry Cheesecake donut The Old Fashioned was dry  maybe cooked a bit hot and the Strawberry Cheesecake just tasted like strawberry filing no tangy cheese to give it that cheesecake vibe The staff are friendly the donuts are very beautiful and they brew Stumptown coffee These are all good things but I have to have more substance with my flash,negative,131,100-150,713,500-1000
Came here for the first time and I must say this place is pretty amazing From unique donuts to classic donuts they all tasted great Id say its pretty pricey for some donuts but its so worth it They even ask for your name to put on the box so that makes me felt a little special The staff is friendly and energized which is great for the downtown area The drinks look amazing but I decided to get a simple strawberry milk and chocolate milk which complemented the donuts even more Ill definitely be coming back here Some tips Id recommend  Get there early preferably in the morning because they do sell till they run out of donuts  If its a nice day Id recommend eating outside in the back because it has a nice feel to it  Always get a drink even if its just milk,positive,151,150-200,783,500-1000
Coffee was good but the almond croissant was the best almond croissant Ive ever had Crispy flaky buttery and worth every calorie This is a great place to run in and grab a pastry and a coffee to begin your walk down the strip I want to go back and have every pastry on their menu,positive,56,50-75,287,<500
This will probably be my new favorite dessert place I ordered a milk tea soft serve with the fish shaped waffle cone and filled it with Nutella This combo is fire so yummy cant wait to go back,positive,38,25-50,195,<500
Toasted marshmallow topping For that alone I will come back over and over Sure the line is a pain in the ass But the friendly staff theyll give you as many tastes as you need to make up your mind and oh yeah the kick ass ice cream make up for it This is the low overrun truly heavy cream and real sugar good stuff The mint chocolate chip is heaven as is the unabashedly floral and wonderful vanilla The Vietnamese coffee is another star you can actually taste the sweetened condensed milk This place is worth the stop,positive,99,75-100,535,500-1000
High prices lame flavors skip I was expecting some more unique flavors from the reviews but was sooo disappointed in the small selection of plain Jane flavors that I ended up not even ordering My husband had a peanut butter chocolate sundae which I tasted it was very rich but nothing I couldnt have gotten in a tub of grocery store ice cream My sister got a small brownie looked old with scoop of vanilla and hot fudge Our order for those two smallstandard regular joe desserts totaled 17 Not worth it,negative,92,75-100,517,500-1000
Honey Bleu Cheese ice cream I loved it But then again one of my favorite snacks is good bleu cheese drizzled with honey on crusty bread The ice cream did not disappoint I bought a pint to go and a pint of the salted caramel which was good not great Not nearly as good as the Honey Bleu Cheese The ice cream is high quality and it should be for 750 a pint Thats the only reason I dont give them 5 stars It is pricey for what is  ice cream Ill be back for a special treat but its not something I can afford on a regular basis,positive,110,100-150,544,500-1000
All hype the location is definitely tourists located not worth the wait however the items here are decent you can get the same quality at any bakery or pizzeria,negative,29,25-50,162,<500
My only regret here was not buying more donuts to eat later throughout the day I had seen a lot of people posting on TikTok and YouTube and I must say that the hype was real There was ample street parking on the road fronting the shop I didnt notice any free stalls just the pay by phonekiosk but finding open stalls was not a problem There was no line on the Thursday morning when I went and it looked like every flavor was still in stock at the time There is only limited seating inside but there are tables outside in a courtyard behind the shop if you leave through the back door I tried the creme brulee and birthday cake donuts The crunch of the sugar on the creme brulee was surprising There was an audible and crisp snap with each bite The birthday cake doughnut was also good but could have used a little more birthday cake flavor Im looking forward to going back Next time Ill leave with significantly more donuts,positive,175,150-200,946,500-1000
Very cute interior but very bad overpriced cupcake Wish them the best of luck but there were clearly some ingredients missing from the batter,negative,24,<50,145,<500
Batch Bakehouse is a boulangerie transplanted along the Willy St food corridor The prices are reasonable the service is authentic with great guidance and recommendations and most importantly the breads and pastries are fantastic Every time that I go I end up purchasing more than I anticipated and I am never disappointed with my purchases Batch only takes cash so be prepared The breads and pastries from Batch have become a welcomed addition to my weekly menu,positive,77,75-100,473,<500

Buddy for ffs extricate your head from your ass and fix this place up Have spent around 7500 per visit at this location for the past three years based upon the Lobster Tail pastry being excellent and then rounding it out with some dark chocolate mousse cake and maybe some cannoli even though they sort of suck compared to anything I ever had on the East coast So picked up four Lobster Tails a hazlenut Lobster Tail a dark chocolate mousse cake and a chocolate mousse cheesecake for my wife on 12017 This was gonna be epic Except the Lobster tails were flatas in the puff pastry never puffednasty chewy awful pastry experience If this was my pastry shop whoever ran the product that day would disappear in the desert or at least be fired depending upon how passionate the proprietor was about quality product but hey what do I care I got a free Carlos Bakery water bottle because I spent enoughareyoukiddinme Very sad but was informed by the recipients that the dark chocolate mousse cake was still deliciousin a previous experience the Lobster Tail was one of the top five pastries I have ever had in life growing up on the East coast that is a bold statement and I own it but not with this one it was total crap and expensive Buddy Come onwake up and own it or close it up and move on,negative,239,200-250,1352,1000-1500

More of these modern dessert places are popping up and it makes Arizona more fun I got an ice cream cone that was infused with Cinnamon Toast Crunch and strawberries as a topping I thought it was enjoyable but there were some cereal parts that were oddly chewy like theyve gone stale The place looks very comfortable and it has cute modern decor that you can take pictures with Either the marble table the palm leave wallpaper the grey walls or the succulent wall that has a glowing sign which reads Drip it like its hot Its a cute place and it has some creative ice cream flavors My cousin got a matcha drink and the matcha is very high grade but we both thought it was very heavy on the matcha,positive,132,100-150,719,500-1000
This place was excellent The boba is high quality and they give out samples for some of the tea flavors which I really appreciate I got the brown sugar milk tea dairy free with boba and it was great Staff was also very knowledgeable about the flavors offered and their caffeine context They also have tons of unique flavors my boyfriend got a captain crunch milkshake and it was really good and weve never had anything else like it The shop was also very clean and cute great vibe Highly recommend as a dessert or boba,positive,96,75-100,533,500-1000
Having been a fan of the original Sprinkles in Beverly Hills for years I thought Id check out the ice cream and cookies here at their new Las Vegas Location at LinQ The usual tasty cakes and ice creams here but their employees have much left to be desired Minus  The situation that is The Line whenever employees feel like it they will enforce The Line policy in which case they force you to stand in line outside of the store to get in a separate line inside but thats not all if you want to go from one section to the other you HAVE to go outside and wait in the other line In which case theres no signs that say that so having an employee talk to me like Im stupid was not the best way to handle things so we left And with this rule in place all you have to do is go in through the exit because the gate keepers are clueless to the other door and none of the other employees will say anything also Overall this place deserves a 4 star for food but a 1 star for service  2 stars Dont get me wrong I love the cupcakes and I love their ice cream but man they need to put up some signs or make it two store fronts,negative,229,200-250,1155,1000-1500

I had my first taste of Bouchon Bakerys macarons around 67 years ago from the New York location It wasnt until this past weekend I was in Vegas that I got to taste the sweet macarons once again They were and still are the best macarons Ive ever had Theyre large the cream is smooth and light and the cookies are flaky but packed with flavor My mom loves these and says they are the best shes ever had too I regret not getting more boxes of these and also trying more of their other baked goods Until next time,positive,100,75-100,525,500-1000

Have always wanted to try the Momofuku milk bar in New York and never got the chance so I was super excited to find this place in LV Turned out to be my biggest disappointment in an ice cream EVER I got the signature cereal milk soft serve The ice cream itself lacked richness and taste felt like a weird middle ground between ice cream and sorbet The cornflakes were not ordinary cornflakes They were not flakes first of all they were crushed and stuck together They were not as crunchy it felt like they have been left out for a while Worst of all they were SALTY Who had the ingenious idea of combining salty and sweet And the price The soft serve itself is 6 and the cornflakes are an extra 125 The whole thing comes out to about 8 with tax I have never paid so much for an ice cream and this is the worse ice cream Ive ever had I didnt even finish it Me Not finishing an ice cream Perfect combination for a 1star,negative,180,150-200,953,500-1000
Epic cannoli the filling has a creme fraiche consistency isnt overly sweet and the texture is perfectly contrasted with the flaky pastry casing The stromboli pizza and prepared foods here are also excellent Prestis is one of the best places in Cleveland and the reason the Little Italy in this city is among the best and most authentic Italian Villages in the country,positive,63,50-75,378,<500
we stopped by to try their milk bar pie apple pie milkquake  soft serve ice cream the employee was very helpful with helping us order and the lines moved very quickly the apple pie milkquake was so good we loved the apple bits in the shake and the flavor was great the soft serve flavor we chose was the milk bar pie  it was sweet but the cornflake topping help cut the sweetness down we also tried their milk bar pie  kinda too sweet for me,positive,89,75-100,453,<500
We purchased half dozen cupcakes Heres the low down Coconut flavor  the cake part tasted like it was made of paper towels Strawberry  Again no flavor to the cake Icing was good Red Velvet  Icing was horrible  Cake was normal Chocolate  Icing good Cake was again like paper towel Im no cake maker but pretty sure cake should be sweet its like these had none Even my sweet toothed 7 year ago hated them Over priced Paper tasting,negative,83,75-100,451,<500

Ive been so excited about visiting since seeing Jenis Ice Cream all over social media The ice cream parlor itself is so cute and trendy I love the sleek designs of the outdoor seating and brightly lit sign making it really stand out Its also conveniently located off the of the light rail and around tons of restaurants making it a great place for dessert When I first opened the door to enter I was hit with the sweet smell of freshly made waffle cones and homemade ice cream I want to take that smell and turn it into a candle that I can just burn every day in my house The ladies working were so wonderful and knowledgeable about each and every flavor They let us try a few before setting on one to commit to I ended up with the Bumbleberry Crisp and the Salted Peanut Butter in a waffle cone It was really good and even if the two flavors didnt necessarily compliment each other with any Jenis ice cream you cant go wrong You can also pick up a pint to take home so you can have some for the rest of the week,positive,198,150-200,1031,1000-1500
The presentation of the ice cream is cute and fun in the Chinese take out box w the fortune cookie but the ice cream itself was just ok I feel there are better ice cream shops in Phoenix The texture of the ice cream wasnt very creamy and the flavor was a little underwhelming I got the banana cream pie Not sure if we will be back,negative,67,50-75,337,<500
Churn has amazing ice cream super good floats sundaes and ice cream sandwiches I used to come here all the time but the last two times Ive been its just awkward The ice cream is still amazing however the customer service is so terrible We went there on Valentines Day and when we first got there we were the only customers inside We approached the counter to order but all the workers were busy talking to each other Even when I made eye contact with one of the employees she quickly looked away so she could continue her conversation with her coworkers When we were finally able to order we moved down the line to pay and stood in front of the register The manager or shift supervisor laughed at us and said the line to order is over there there was a long line now and I said that we had already ordered and were ready to pay and she rang us up while still continuing a conversation with someone else We thought maybe it was because it was Valentines Day and they were busy but even tonight the service was bad Even overhearing how the employees interacted with other customers was bad they were short with them and if they customers said something that wasnt on par with ice cream lingo they would act condescending I love churn and think they have amazing ice cream but the service honestly ruins the experience,negative,244,200-250,1351,1000-1500
Basing this review entirely on the terrible service received tonight The entire staff consisted of young kids tonight Had a cashier who started off polite but when he saw we were a party of ten he got rude Mind you we only ordered 4 freakin items That is 4 items for a little over FIFTY dollars In the most asshole tone this kid turns to the girl packaging orders and goes I need a lobster tail AND strawberries AND cake AND another slice of cake Excuse me Sorry for the inconvenience Youd think that was it but the runner had an attitude as big as the Venetian itself She shorted us one slice of cake so when this was brought to her attention she rudely says can I help you Clearly inconvenienced I proceed to tell her she missed a slice of cake and she starts to ARGUE with me about what I ordered and paid for Until finally she was proven wrong by the guy at the register Turns out I was right thank you very much I told her thanks for the attitude as she handed me my missing item after telling me I was wrong when I wasnt And as I was walking out another woman proceeded to call her a bitch Goes to show you what kind of staff theyve got working Get it together and hire someone worthwhile,negative,233,200-250,1226,1000-1500
Prestis is a good choice as a coffee shop to sit and do homework or meet a friend or for a quick lunch or dinner Some of the pastries are better than others I think my favorite is the cannoli I have a friend who claims that the chocolate chip cookie here is one of the best in the world I disagree I think the chocolate chip cookie here is fine but nothing special Ive had enough good experiences with pastry here that I want to try more of the options I like the stromboli and the pizza The sausage and spinach stromboli or the vegetable stromboli will make a nice cheap takeout meal Another cool thing about Prestis is the energy It does get crowded and there can be a long line to order People really use and enjoy Prestis I do have one significant beef with Prestis and that is that they do not allow samples of the gelato I get that when theyre busy its probably inconvenient to have somebody waffling over what flavor to get but trying ones ice cream before committing is a time honored tradition that should be allowed at least when there isnt a line out the door,positive,205,200-250,1097,1000-1500
Went there based on Yelp reviews It did not disappoint There was a long line but the friendly staff showed great teamwork and organization The line moved quickly I just wish there was more seating as we had to take our treats to our car to eat Wife had honey lavender and she really enjoyed it I tried it and you can taste the lavender with out it overpowering the palate I had both the Belgian chocolate which was great and sweet corn which had actual corn in it I know it sounds wierd but it was really great ice cream I will surely return the next time Im in town,positive,111,100-150,578,500-1000
We went here for the first time last weekend I had the dark chocolate cherry bread pudding It was amazing The atmosphere is great too,positive,25,<50,138,<500
I purchased a whole chocolate cake which I had preordered online This was my first time buying baked goods at this shop today My daughter selected the shop for her bday cake due to positive reviews online I spent about 70 after tax etc It looked nice but thats it The cake was EXTREMELY dry and seemed old The texture was awful for the money We bake better cakes at home Nobody at the bday party finished their slice and we all agreed WalMart cake taste better and fresher We ended up running out for replacement dessert tonight,negative,98,75-100,543,500-1000
Lets just say my grandmothers and moms baking is WAY better than this Its overrated and blehhh Definitely not worth the wait or the price Go to your local mexican panaderia and I promise youll spend less time less money and say YUM Que bueno more times than this whatever they call itfancy cakes I wish Buddy did something about those employees they have absolutely no sense of urgency when it comes to service ANDALE you have people waiting mensos,negative,80,75-100,473,<500
Everything about this place is amazing The crack pie was best Its sweet and chewy The cereal ice cream initially tasted weird but your second and third bite was amazing They also put cereal at the bottom of the cup which made for a nice surprise The service was fast and easy I couldnt be happier Ive been wanting to try this place forever,positive,64,50-75,350,<500
Came here due to the hype but left disappointed I got the Greatest Hits sampler 22 which had crack pie cereal milk soft serve birthday cake truffles and compost cookie All the baked goods were cloyingly sweet so no other subtly of flavor could come through The cereal milk soft serve had a strong malt flavor but didnt blow me away On top of nothing being that fantastic this place is pretty expensive and the desserts are quite small I guess hype can be a doubleedged sword because it was the reason I came here but I also think if I had lowerno expectations I would have enjoyed it more but still not enough to recommend it or return,negative,119,100-150,658,500-1000
I love The Donut Bar The staff is really lax and the donuts are amazing It just sucks that they close early but they usually sell out before then I love their churro cones with ice cream on the top Please open more locations,positive,44,25-50,229,<500
This is a great place to buy treats for friends and family at home I bought a bunch of their cookies They recommended their compost cookies which is a mixture of many different things pretzels chocolate chips their corn cookie made with corn flakes and their confetti cookie funfetti like cookie Their cookies are pricey 4 per cookie The confetti cake was pretty good I actually liked their confetti cake more than their popcorn cake The popcorn cake was on the sweeter side for me It was my first time trying crack pie too It was nice and buttery I really enjoyed itespecially with the ice cream I always like to get their milk and cereal ice cream too Its on the plainer side but sweet and savory This place can have a long line so if the line is somewhat short I would give it a try At least try a cookie,positive,153,150-200,839,500-1000
Whey they first opened they had a variety of bread and did not run or of any of the popular ones After some time they started running out of the popular ones and they even discontinued a few that were pretty good The selection is very limited now which is quite disappointing,negative,52,50-75,280,<500
Its unclear if this is a temporary location vinyl banner instead of a real sign outside only one wall decorated everything else is painted very bare white strangely mismatched light wooden trash can nothing displayed in the glass case Dont expect to be offered samples like the local artisan ice cream or gelato shops or even Baskin Robbins as there is no ice cream on display and employees wont offer I was greeted with For here or to go which better suits a place with prices that are half of what this shop is charging For some reason they were playing awful screaming for singing with electric guitar music While Im not expecting oldschool soda shoppediner music this was awful Minus 1 star 675 after tax1 for tip  almost 8 for my 20 oz cup size not really that much soda due to foam and overflow float Very overpriced minus the second star considering the ice cream did not have a pronounced vanilla flavor was more grocery store vanilla as opposed to a French or Vanilla Bean flavor and had a somewhat icy texture It was okay and the root beer itself was a drinkable chilled temperature The worker brought the root beer float out with the styrofoam togo cup covered completely with streams of overflowing soda minus a third star Obviously he had not wiped it down and replied with there are napkins on your table when I discretely asked for napkins while pointing to the big mess The young man did apologize after I had thoroughly wiped down the cup removed the lid which was causing the overflow and wiped it down again The correct good customer service response should have been to quickly realize the mistake it never should have happened in the first place acknowledge it apologize and wipe down the cup with a clean wet cloth while offering to top up the root beer in the float I dont think these young new employees have been trained or empowered to give excellent customer service though A big problem is I assume as I didnt get one they dont have domed lids so the shakes froth gets all over when they smash down the ice cream with a normal flat soda lid Im sure it would be even more horrific with whipped cream and a cherry Please use domed lids I am not giving them one star as theyre local and still probably in the stage of figuring things out and my float wasnt bad after all I appreciate that the young man apologized for the messy cup but it was too little too late I do not see myself coming back due to the high price mediocre quality and untrained customer service,negative,458,300- 500,2589,2000+
Decided to visit this place since it was so hyped by its East Coast stores and its definitely overrated in my opinion First of all the line is almost always really long You can expect to wait probably at least 1520 minutes in line Not sure about the prices in New York but this was probably one of the priciest ice cream places Ive been to A serving of softserve is 6 and the milkshakes go from 79 for the basic ones 12 for alcoholic ones The serving size of a milkshare is about the size of a Grande cup at Starbucks so it wasnt even that much either I got the cereal milk milkshake and I actually couldnt even finish it because of the taste The one good thing was that it wasnt overly sweet but it started tasting worse and worse with every sip It also felt very heavy for some reason If youre in Vegas and you want something refreshing to drinkeat dont come to Milk The taste price and line is just not worth it,negative,179,150-200,945,500-1000
They stayed open into late afternoon for Life Is Beautiful so I was finally able to try these gems on our way into the festival We tried Butter Beer donut first which was delightful but the crown jewel was the strawberry Big Poppa Tart with a full size PopTart baked right in the middle This donut was DELICIOUS with what tasted like strawberry jam oozing everywhere Nicely done Donut Bar,positive,70,50-75,397,<500
I have been to melt a few times This last trip was terrible From the minute I walked in I felt pressure to make a choice immediately The staff just stared at you Less than helpful I tried a few flavors and decided on the peanut butter MEH Simply not that great Also stupid expensive Not worth it If youre in the downtown area I would recommend sweet republic or churn Much better service and ice cream is way better there Not pleased and will not be coming back,negative,89,75-100,479,<500
I was so excited about this place but the customer service was meh We werent greeted by the cashier and she seemed like she didnt want to be there The chai latte was okay,negative,34,25-50,175,<500
This place is beautiful Large window to see into the factory Clean and smells great We had the seasonal ice cream in the waffle cones and it was fantastic The ONLY problem is the long wait There was 1 girl working and 2 customers ahead of me Other than that this place is a must,positive,55,50-75,286,<500
I was very disappointed to learn that 99 of their items are frozen and then thawed or baked then decorated Certainly not worth my money when there are a number of bakeries in Vegas and on the strip that offer freshly made items daily and dont require a ridiculous wait in line This place is more of a novelty than a quality bakery Not impressed with any of the items Ive had from this place Save your time and money and go to Bouchon Bakery instead,negative,86,75-100,456,<500
I really wanna really like this place but everytime I go there is always loaded of people there The price for macaroons are making it hard for me to like them I know it doesnt cost much to make it and the stuff can be NICER BUT THEY ARENT so its hard to like this place They see us as  or annoying customer that ask for loaded stuff They only reason this place is the hot spot right now is because theirs no others 247 bakery near by or in Charlotte period 230 for onemacroons is just too high,negative,100,75-100,510,500-1000
Ate my cheesecake too quickly to even take a picture We were warmly greeted by the guy taking our order He suggested he white chocolate mouse and dark chocolate moose We ended up with the chocolate covered cheesecake We ordered with him then went to go pay Once ready they call your name The cheesecake was 12 but was AMAZING So moist and delicious Service was great and quick Cant wait to try other cakes from Carlos bakery,positive,78,75-100,437,<500
Ice cream is good but the service could be improved I rarely get what I actually order A peanut butter cup tornado with chocolate ice cream isnt that hard to understand or make They just lack attention to detail First they made me a mm tornado with chocolate ice cream and when I told them it was supposed to be peanut butter cup I got a peanut butter cup with vanilla ice cream This didnt happen just once either My order is wrong more times than it is right Ill just start telling them to surprise me since I always am when I go here,negative,105,100-150,548,500-1000
Wow that was really tasteless ice cream Maybe people in AZ have not been to WI or an other place with good ice cream,negative,24,<50,118,<500
Tried quite a few items on the menu and felt it was overhyped We ordered milk cereal soft serve crack soft serve fruity milk soft serve compost cookie corn cookie bday cake truffles crack pie cereal milk ice cream shake and crack pie latte The milk cereal soft serve is very bland not a lot of flavor and the corn flakes that accompany it are way tooooo salty If you want to try a better version go to Afters The milk cereal ice cream at Afters is far superior and the afterflakes are delicious sweet and salty and perfectly complements the ice cream The fruity soft serve and flakes were strange The texture was similar to cool whip and again the flakes were salty Both the latte and milkshake lacked flavor The best things we tried were the crack pie and crack soft serve Honestly couldnt bring ourselves to try the bday truffles after being disappointed with most of everything we ordered Would not recommend going here,negative,167,150-200,945,500-1000
I wanted to grab breakfast here and ended up buying a few snacks for later in our day Not many options but what we had was great Very hard to find though,positive,32,25-50,157,<500
It still bothers me that I spent 10 on a horrible dessert I had some brownie sundae w ice cream whip cream and hot fudge The brownie was rock hard and was impossible to remove as it sat at the bottom of the sundae cup they served it in,negative,49,25-50,247,<500
So happy we found this gem and the drive was so worth it We ordered the Madagascar vanilla strawberry butter pecan and honey lavender All were delicious The owner Brandon was incredibly nice and humble Cant wait to go back and try the other flavors,positive,45,25-50,258,<500
I grabbed a macaroon here the other day and it sucked The macaroon itself was huge but very very dry and tasted like it been sitting in the fridge for a week and a half Literally it had no flavor and was hard as a rock For 350 it wasnt what I was expecting If you want a awesome macron go to pasta fresh and get a box,negative,68,50-75,325,<500
The cannoli tasted like there was cat litter in them So gritty and no flavor The lemon cookie was very dry and brittle Will not buy again,negative,27,25-50,141,<500
Two stars for the pastry five for people watching Had an eclair it was very average compared to the bakeries that I eat at in Paris The decoration is very Dorothy Draper which I loved Good French sodas though,negative,39,25-50,215,<500
First and last time coming here The staff are very unhappy looking rude didnt even welcome us A lot of people come here from watching the show Cake Boss but we were very dissappointed Food was not to our expectation very bland taste and undercooked Lastly the waiter we had asked us if he could KEEP the change Instead of waiting for his tip Very rude and disrespectful We will not be coming here again,negative,75,50-75,416,<500
I was really looking forward to trying a new bakery I love bakeries and seek them out everywhere We ordered two 16oz House iced coffees a cheddar jalapeÃo Baily bagel chocolate croissant and a black  white cookie to the tune of 19 I will say the baked goods were good I liked the bagel But the cookie was slightly stale and the iced coffee turned to watered down coffee by the time we got to the car I returned them and asked for two regular coffees there was no issue there Now coffee is certainly supposed to be hot But this coffee was HOT We waited twenty minutes before it being hot enough to sip and ended up just tossing both full cups after a half hour So all in all it just wasnt worth it This was the Pecan Ave location I am adding more to my review a couple days later after checking the online receipt I was emailed I noticed I was charged an extra 1 for cream cheese for my bagel The cream cheese comes in a small packet that resembles something for mayo at fast food spots And I got charged 1 for that Yeah will not be visiting again or recommending,negative,208,200-250,1093,1000-1500
Favorite genuine ice cream stop seasonal flavors alway change to add variety I tried the chocolate peanut butter brownie and chocolate pecan One kid had the sherbet flavors lime pineapple orange and red raspberry The other had the Cookie Monster and grandma had bing cherry Everyone enjoyed their choices,positive,49,25-50,313,<500

For years I had been so excited to try the highly acclaimed bday cake and just last week I finally had my chance After hearing how it is the best tasting cake ever I had high expectationshowever they were far from met This is the most overrated dessert I have ever had Dry flavorless and overpriced just buy funfetti at the store and youll be better off,negative,67,50-75,363,<500
If its your first time coming here then good luck Customer service was terrible We told the girl it was our first time and she vaguely told us how it works She also assumed we were done ordering when my friend still hadnt ordered As we waited in line some other customers also told a different cashier that it was their first time and she just told them to take their time As we got our cones the presentation was terrible No consistency in any of their products One cone was broken and was clearly dripping so she just gave us extra napkins rather than having used a different cone Quality of product is meh doesnt stand out from other ice cream shops but customer service needs serious improvement Its a gamble so just ask yourself if you also want to waste your time waiting outside in the heat only to deal with terrible service and mediocre quality of products,negative,160,150-200,885,500-1000
Ive always wanted to try his pastries since Ive heard so many things about it but Ive always been to lazy to try to find it lol Embarrassed to say this cause Ive always stayed at palazzoVenetian as a visitor to resident I had to wait in line but they had an efficient system going on so the wait wasnt too bad Let me just start by saying EVERYTHING LOOKS GOOD Like I wanted to get everything but I knew it was going to be very expensive as no prices were marked its like order what looks good then surprise I ended up getting 2 lobster tails 2 cannolis and a strawberry cheesecake The lobster tails were AMAZING They were crispy and perfect even when I ate it around 5 hours after buying them I liked that they werent too sweet and even my mom loved them I am definitely going to buy more of those when I go back The cannolis on the other hand werent that good I ended up only eating half of one and gave the other one away I was disappointed in them and wish I had ordered more lobster tails instead The cheesecake was expensive like almost 12 and it was so small It was pretty good though theres not much crust or anything like Cheesecake Factory ones but more like just the cheesecake part If youre a cheesecake fan I definitely recommend Overall Id definitely go back for more lobster tails Id highly recommend you get some if you stop by The bakery is pretty pricey but if its good its worth it,positive,270,250-300,1440,1000-1500
Worst place I ever visited If you order via online as exactly they instructed at the door you obviously have to wait for 20 mins to get your order And when you make any sensible suggestions the workers will be furiously mad and rude to you,negative,46,25-50,245,<500
Like all of the other reviews states the crepes are good but the service is horrid Expect to wait a while because everything is made to order I do appreciate this but there is no sense of urgency in the staff The bald dude making the CrÃªpes was working soooo slow taking his good ole time He was mumbling under his breath and rolling his eyes every 5 seconds It was 9am how could you be THAT miserable THAT early in the morning I love crepes but I wouldnt recommend this place to anyone Not until the staff gets an attitude adjustment anyways,negative,103,100-150,559,500-1000

Came here because of the good reviews and delicious looking photos There wasnt a lot of variety in either flavors or menu offerings 4 is a lot for a single scoop of ice cream especially when it isnt very good The chocolate flavor tasted sugary sweet rather than having a rich chocolate flavor The mint chip had a very strong aftertaste that wasnt pleasant,negative,64,50-75,366,<500

My very first impression of this place was kinda like where the hell am I and is this really the place where they serve the famous fat daddy ice cream macaroon mallow It was kind of hidden and a hole in the wall The best kind of course Sure enough I walked in and yup the eagle had landed Customer service here was top notch The lady who served us  Lani gave recommendations and had a friendly chat with myself and my son about life in Az Kids the establishment etc She even let me charge my phone while we were enjoying the goods I decided on the caramel macaroon and dulce de leche ice cream I also got to try the coffee ice cream which would have been my second choice and the Nutella which was just ok The marshmallow was my favorite and next time I will ask for it extra toasted just so it shmelts every where slidemelt haha My son got the chocolate ice cream with chocolate sprinkles and Oreos Hes always full stoke when you can add toppings Overall we loved our experience Fatty Daddys is the place to indulge and get your sweet tooth satisfied Especially here in AZ where its hotter then hellooooo,positive,211,200-250,1130,1000-1500

Small selection of actual Ice cream but thats simple because all the greAtest us what the have Take a trip down memory lane with this shop I relived my childhood while waiting in line Ice cream sandwich with fresh homemade cookies for 5 Cant beat that Cookies alone are 2 each It was delicious A bit on the sweet side but what can you expect when you put ice cream in between 2 chocolate chip cookies Place is kinda small but has seating areas in front and back of the store Staff was friendly and allowed me to try samples of their ice cream before I ordered Impressed with this place Will surely be returning and bringing new friends,positive,119,100-150,652,500-1000
Buddy has always been an inspiration to me ever since I was little For this exact reason we drove all the way to Las Vegas to visit his bakery I decided to order the cannoli because that is their special dish and their lobster tail I also got a cupcake and a brownie I was all excited to eat it but when I tried the cannoli it was the most disgusting thing I have ever tried in my life it was super sweet and tasted like oil The lobster tail was bad enough to because it tasted like egg and lard The cupcake was dry and tasted like nothinglastly the brownie was good but if your not a chocolate fan do not get it Overall experience is do not go unless you want bad quality dessert that you could get cheaper and better at the supermarket,negative,146,100-150,746,500-1000
This is the first time weve stopped in at Fatty Daddys but based on the reviews and pictures we were intrigued The dessert with cookie and toasted marshmallow was the only special dessert item They were out of most flavors and the one they had that we thought looked good was not Chocolate Nutella was disappointing to the point that my wife and I threw it away Its saying something if my wife throws away ice cream We stopped at a gas station for a pint of Ben and Jerrys It was much better Again though our only time there and it was late The staff was friendly,negative,108,100-150,581,500-1000
Worst rip off ever I came from WASHINGTON DC just to get a cake made for my wedding Unfortunately the wedding got called off But I paid a 50 deposit for my cake tasting which is supposed to go towards the cake Well being that the wedding was called off I didnt need the cake but was told that the could get a refund when I originally agreed to even do the tasting After visiting today I am being told that my deposit is non refundable Thats is such a scam,negative,91,75-100,464,<500

With pastries and coffee now well covered and plenty interesting enough to put Phoenix on my culinary map the next question was how well they did Ice Cream and coming from the selfproclaimed Ice Cream Capital of America I figured I might as well just go for the best to compare headtohead with the Jenis BiRites and Toscaninis of the world  in this case Scottsdales own Sweet Republic Rated by Bon Appetite as one of the nations 10best and focused on small batch artisan flavors just like the rest of the list Sweet Republic is tucked into a small strip mall off Shea Boulevard and while not simple to find the products are also available by the pint at Whole Foods Not wanting a pint but rather to sample I made my way up the stairs to the small store to find it largely empty  a surprise since every parlor in Ohio is lined up out the door when it is 100 degrees out but perhaps not surprising in Scottsdale where temperatures frequently reach such peaks Entering the store I was greeted by the smell of sugar vanilla and that alltoofamiliar scent of ice cream cones and within moments I was greeted by a young lady ready with sampling spoons Not wanting to be greedy but certainly wanting to sample a couple before buying in my first two tastes of Sweet Republics Ice Cream would be Tres Leches a dense and flavorful but largely onedimensional vanilla and next Desert Honey a lovely bite not dissimilar to a frozen liquid BitoHoney With easily twenty more flavors to taste and my server not seeming to mind my next two bites would prove memorable enough to commit to a double  one scoop of Honey Blue Cheese and the other of Salted Butter Caramel  for 425 Waiting for the scoops as I browsed the shops collection of cookies candies and even bacon brittle I thanked my server for her assistance and sitting down to enjoy my choices I was very pleased by one and blown away by the other Beginning first with the Salted Butter Caramel a flavor I try everywhere this dense concoction with pockets of liquid gold oozing from the otherwise milky sweet ice cream was exceptional and on par in all ways with that of Jenis back home  potentially even better though a sidebyside would need to be done to be certain Moving next to the Blue Cheese  easily a top 5 ice cream moment of all time with the sharp notes of the cheese aptly countered by the sweetness of the honey and the overall texture somewhere between frozen frosting and cheesecake an absolute must try for anyone living in or visiting the area whether it is 100 degrees or not,positive,467,300- 500,2583,2000+
Im a fan of the sandwiches here but Amelies used to slice the meat very thinly The last few sandwiches Ive eaten have had very thick slices of meat almost like they were carved for dinner Its kind of offputting on a sandwich Please go back to the days of yore Amelies Edit bumped up a star based on response Thank you,positive,62,50-75,332,<500

I was here over a month ago on a Monday right when Milk Bar opened at 2pm I came to Vegas for the weekend for my birthday and was leaving on that Monday which was also the day of my birthday I was so excited to get a slice of the popular birthday cake and I was even more excited to be the very first customer I placed my order A slice of the birthday cake please Employee We are sold out Come back in 4560 minutes and it should be thawed Um what How could I be the first customer for the day and youre sold out of a product already The employee was definitely lacking customer service I used to work in the food industry and would have to come in a hour before open to setup prep etc How does Milk Bar not have someone come in an hour earlier to thaw their famous frozen cakes to be ready at open at 2pm in the afternoon This was a very disappointing experience,negative,175,150-200,897,500-1000
First off 85 is not a bad bakery Some of their pastry items are good like the egg tart and milk breads I also love their Black Tea with Sea Salt Cream and my husband loves their Thai Tea That being said the service here is absolutely horrendous Talk about under staff and SLOW workers I get it 85 is popular and Vegas has been anticipating its grand opening for a while now Im not surprised that its constantly crowded but it seems like everytime I come here theyre always backed up and out of pastries The cashiers do multiple tasks instead of just checking customers out This makes the whole payment process inefficient because it takes up too much time They not only have to count the pastries and input it into the system but they assemble cardboard carrying boxes and individually place each pastry item into plastic bags before arranging them into the box This whole process can take up to 5 minutes and thats before they even begin to collect money Ive been to many of the 85 in California and I know this is pretty standard for how they check out but with the large amount of customers visiting this single location I just dont think its a smart use of time At least assemble the carrying boxes in advance or omit individually packaging the pastries all together to speed up the process Also the register girls work so slow I get that everyone is new but still have some sense of urgency for the crowd Its toture watching the girls take their time in a line that wraps around muitple loops especially since youve been waiting for over 30 minutes just to check out The last time we came my husband ate 1 pastry while we waited because he was hungry and the line took so long We also witnessed a guy literally drop his tray full of pastries onto a nearby counter and left because he didnt want to wait any longer I wonder if the staff threw the pastries away or if they put it back into the shelves for sale Either way that was a loss of money for the business Of course we told the cashier my husband ate a pastry the wrapper was still on the tray but I wonder how many people munched on their items while waiting and dont bother to tell the cashier With the amount of crowd its really easy to go unnoticed Also while my husband was waiting in line I went to the selforder kiosk and got us drinks since it came quicker from a separate counter The screen advertised Thai Tea that was buy 1 get 1 free from December until early January I order the Thai Tea but didnt see a prompt for a free drink so I decided to ask the register She seemed confused at first and then she said Oh we dont have that promotion here because were grand opening I asked her then why is it advertised on the screen if you dont honor it Her reply was We cant take it off the screen Sorry I just left it at that This is not against the girl She was polite and only doing her job but if youre going to advertise something and youre a franchise then at least state that its not valid at this location or something similar to that effect Otherwise thats just false advertising and unethical business If its not a valid promotion then it should be taken down otherwise it should still be honored if its advertised Either way Im not fussing about a free Thai Tea but I just thought that was strange It really adds to the whole unprepared under staffed and poor management of this place Hopefully theyll figure things out in the future Like I said 85 is not a bad bakery,negative,654,500+,3542,2000+
We stopped by here to try them out after going to try Sheng Ramen in Ballantyne I dig the decor and its where the old TCBY used to be at the Arboretum I decided to get the soft serve which is a bit pricey at 550 but it was still good I got the mix of Matcha and Vanilla and realized Im still not the biggest matcha person but it was very good ice cream nonetheless Totally instagrammable too as there were a group of girls taking selfie pics galore with their treats Im not sure if its worth driving 30 mins for me but Ill def be back to try one of their drinks when Im in the area to eat because New Zealand Cafe is my jam,positive,129,100-150,637,500-1000
Went here with friends and loved it Waited in line for about five minutes but it was fine because of the great atmosphere Lots of toys and fun things to look at I had the cookies and crÃme and loved every bite I wouldve gone with two scoops if I would have known They gave a cute spoon with my cup also Little bit overpriced but thats all ice cream shops Could use more seating but definetly check this place out,positive,81,75-100,425,<500

My goodness I love this place Its eclectic and charming and brings a smile to my face every time I visit I havent been here when the place isnt buzzing so be sure to go with a bit of time to spare because you may have to wait in a line that often wraps around the inside of the building Nevertheless the staff moves quickly and its worth the short wait Amelies pastries are adorably ornate and match the cute decor perfectly Their famous salted caramel brownie lives up to the hype with a rich brownie layer a crunchy sugar layer and a soft caramel layer on top Their CrÃme BrÃlÃe is equally delicious and their savory items like croissants and sandwiches are also quite a treat With two locations in the Charlotte area Amelies is a must,positive,138,100-150,760,500-1000
I am not a fan of the show but wanted to have the taste of real cannolis once again Being from the East Coast I decided to try my luck through the crowds YEP its crowded but this is Vegas Everything is crowded Cannolis Wonderful The pastries and brownies DIVINE The lobster tails Amazing The Nut bars OH MY HEAVENLY NUTBAR I have tried so many things from there and I have not been disappointed once It is a fantastic addition to Vegas and I hope they open another off the strip location so I can make them a weekly trip The staff is all wonderful and attentive Keep up the good work guys,positive,114,100-150,616,500-1000
I really want to like it Been there twice cause I want to give it a second chance For someone who loves desserts it just wasnt there Certain things were dry other things were lacking flavor both times  Great Decour and really nice service but the food quality is just not there,negative,53,50-75,290,<500

We ordered the cereal milk White Russian with high hopes but took two drinks and threw them away 24 bucks literally in the trash can The drink tasted very sour and nothing at all like cereal milk or a White Russian In hindsight i wish i would have gotten the coffee  frangelico  i bet that one is great DO NOT GET THE CEREAL MILK WHITE RUSSIAN Trust me,negative,70,50-75,363,<500
Only been a couple of times in the last year The place has a wonderful atmosphere but many of the baked goods are not made from scratch The feel is very authentic and the staff has been nothing but stellar The coffee is SPOT ON but the frozen tarts and cinnamon buns just kind of take off points for me,positive,60,50-75,308,<500
super cute place with super cute and delicious ice cream very unique and fun I love all the flavors because they are not your usual ones and they are more fun I had the Reeses ice cream and they put Real Cereal  on top very good yum yum go if youre ever in the area i know i will be,positive,61,50-75,302,<500

VERY Yummy I was so happy to see Bouchon Bakery as soon as I hoped off the elevator this morning I paid them a visit twice  The bread pudding was SO good and the chocolate Bouchon amazing What a nice treat this morning accompanied by a non fat latte Later in the day I had another and tried a double chocolate cookie everything looked amazing This is the perfect place for breakfast or a tasty treat I cant wait to try Bouchon next time Im in town I wanted to order one of everything to bring home with me Fabulous,positive,101,100-150,530,500-1000
We were excited to try Milk Bar after hearing so much about it Unfortunately it didnt live up to the hype for us We tried the milk bar pie which was ok but very greasy and heavy without much flavor We also tried the cereal milk soft serve ice cream which neither of us liked at all  terrible flavor with a very strange buttery cornflake topping that clashed with the ice cream  ended up throwing it away which was a shame for how much it cost,negative,88,75-100,454,<500
Took over an hour to get some okay cookies Its not the product although just okay but the service Only two people helping customers Sure buddy could afford a little more help As my wife stood in line I watched the operation behind the counter OMG one guy waited on approximately 4 customers in an hour as he walked around lost and took over 10 minutes to put on some latex gloves The cashier leans on the counter when she rings something ever 5 minutes Get some more help and upgrade your staff they are awful,negative,96,75-100,518,500-1000
They definitely have some delicious treats Wish they made some more savory options We make a trip there at least once a month for a yummy snack My favorite is the egg tarts,positive,33,25-50,175,<500

Absolutely insanely delicious The key lime is fantastic I loved the peanut butter chocolate it may have ruined all other peanut butter ice cream for me Friendly staff reasonable prices and you get a view of the factory,positive,38,25-50,224,<500
This place is fun and unique The flavors are different than a Baskin Robbins or Coldstone mostly because of the way that its made For instance the mint ice cream is literally mint like with mint leaves in there Definitely worth a try and youre sure to find something unique that you like,positive,53,50-75,296,<500
Macarons macarons macarons Thats all I see on these reviews here Ive been to Bouchon Bakery before but I just happened to stop by because I stayed at Venetian back then and the guest elevator was right there Ive ordered coffee and something else which I cant remember what They were good but didnt think anything was exceptional My sister was with me this time and she happened to like these kind of bakeries so we headed to try this oh so popular macarons They looked like one of those tasteless meringue desserts I wasnt sold still I told the guy Ive never had them so pick one flavor for me He said his favorites were coffee or pistachio so I got a coffee macaron and a madeleine Ive bought a little bag of madeleines at Jean Philippe Patisserie before and they were very dry and awful I was very disappointed with them but Bouchons madeleine was moist and good as it should be Finally I had a bite of macaron Oooohh Mmmmyyy Goooood it was soooo gooooood My sister said there is this bakery shop near her work which sells macarons and they were so good she always thought to bring some for me but they were so delicate she never did She got chocolate and raspberry Chocolate one was good but I thought coffee was a bit better and the raspberry one was not too sweet not too tangy simply delicious She said those macarons are even better than her favorite place They were probably one of the best thing Ive eaten for a long time and Im talking about a dessert Crazy good Before we left Vegas we stopped there again and had some more for us on the road and few more for my pet sitter Ive asked them to put a few in a box and they told me they have a box of each flavor total of six for price of five so Ive got that Those macarons must have something in it like we call Pinkberry Crackberry They are so addictive and now I want to drive 4 hours to Vegas just to get those macarons now Those macarons definitely deserve the 5 stars,positive,371,300- 500,1989,1500-2000
Klossis review  I tried the 5boro which is chocolate fudge cookie with chocolate chips and is gluten free and dairy free which is my jam This cookie is almost paleo except for small amounts of corn starch Its got a flourless brownie texture and taste which I absolutely loved Calling this a cookie is just wrong so I think its misplaced into that but if you want a flattened brownie which gives you that decadent fix  get it They had two other gluten free and dairy free options which sound interesting with one being more of a energy bar style cookie and the other a simple oats and maple cookie which sounded meh Any place that has great cookies for the allergy friendly and doesnt taste like cardboard is a win in my book,positive,136,100-150,735,500-1000
Just came here again Love this place The owner and his staff are awesome Love the creme brÃlÃe I wish I could try all the different donuts They are all amazing,positive,31,25-50,168,<500
Disappointed at this location Sunday afternoon and most of the flavors were gone Tried strawberry and chocolate peanut but both were disappointing  left like artificial flavors  ,negative,29,25-50,185,<500
Honestly overpriced for taste and presentation Serving in a take out box with a fortune cookie is hella cute but so VERY inconvenient to eat out of The paper box disintegrates duh Forget abt saving leftovers if you have any sticky mess Tastes like straight sugar if thats your thing On the stringy chewy side,negative,55,50-75,318,<500
I really like this place They really try to make your ice cream experience better I had the Cookie Monster cookies and cream ice cream with Cookie Crisp cereal and chocolate syrup perfect to share if youre not to much into sweets,positive,42,25-50,237,<500
I have no idea why this place is  when it really is  Much better than Starbucks imo i dont really care about the inspector situation because as long as they use boiling water to make their coffee Im assuming they dont dip their hands in it afterwards This place overshadows Starbucks as a casual hangoutstudy in a couple areas 1 Much better lighting and study areas more tables  Im sorry Starbucks but I absolutely hate your dimly lit areas for studying for romantic coffee may be better the natural light really comes in and the store is right on the corner facing the south with huge windows so you get really good natural lighting all day long On the downside its less cozy but much better for studying 2 Wider selection of nondrink items They give you two heaping scoops of gelato for 295  so yummy and definitely more yogurty less sweet deadening than other gelato ive had They also have really soft and fresh asian pastries tons of sweet and salty options and even little cups of korean bibimbaps They also serve warm breakfast and tons of little snacks all MUCH cheaper than Starbucks and even more delicious 3 Cute decor This place is korean so this place has got a super kawaii atmosphere about it The music is soft and cafelike they have lots of little plants and books in the place  definitely gives me the feeling that Im back in asia again aside from almost everyone in the whole store being asian Definitely reminds me of White Windmill back home but with a less crowded more brightly lit study environment,positive,278,250-300,1574,1500-2000

I have lived in the area of Pages Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs I have always enjoyed the ice cream until this day I ordered an artic swirl chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough I have ordered this same item over and over again When I took first taste no chocolate chip cookie dough pieces second taste same thing third taste same thing and so on for approximately 5 or 6 tastes I took the cup with remaining up to counter and asked them to remake I was denied told it would waste their money nothing about mine what I had ordered was more expensive than plain chocolate ice cream They dumped what was in the medium cup into a small and handed back to me Well it wasnt even a medium desert since it fit into a small cup I even tipped the girl 2 when I first received my desert I will never return to make any other purchases I will however return to express my disdain to the owner when I can find him there I hope he reads this,negative,186,150-200,971,500-1000
Mitchells has a strange combination of delectable sweets along with a sterile lab look right behind the cashier Its an interesting concept to have glass walls so everyone can peer in to the workers dressed in white coats and masks working to make delicious ice cream There is also a second floor which made it feel a bit more like a zoo But who am I to complain about an ice cream zoo They have different and unique varieties of ice cream so I will definitely come back here if I ever visit again,positive,94,75-100,503,500-1000
We bought a dozen of there donuts and then had a sampling There was lot of hype that built this place up First off they dont open until 8 am on the weekends for someone like me 8 am might as well be noon on the weekends The glaze and toppings they put on their donuts is really good the dough though is too much Its too bready To me it doesnt taste like a cake donut it taste like 4 slices of white Webers bread sans the crust of course with topping on itTo me a donuts dough should be on the light side of sweet and cakey maybe they bake them here I cant say for sure I can be a bit snobbish about my donuts but everyone in our group agreed on that one point I listed above,negative,141,100-150,699,500-1000
This is our favourite place for ice cream on state street Theres an excellent selection with quick and helpful employees The seating area is always kept tidy The prices are reasonable and the product is rich and delicious Even on very busy days theyre able to get through large crowds of people efficiently So even if its a hot busy day on state street you can count on getting ice cream without the stress I highly recommend,positive,77,75-100,439,<500
What more can I add to the already sufficient reviews left for this fine establishment Relatively new to the Ohio City scene the fact that its already synomous with the neighborhood is a testament as to how truly beloved Mitchells is Clevelanders are all about anything local so by nature Clevelanders are fiercely loyal But real talk its clean spacious friendly  Willy Wonka himself would be proud Ice cream flavors for days Go treat yo self to a salted caramel milk shake I know Im gonna,positive,87,75-100,506,500-1000
Since I watched Chefs table I was super excited to try Milk Bar We bought the all favorite package I think it was around 23 including cereal milk soft serve birthday truffle compost cookie and crack pie They all turn out to be below average taste They are all very very very sweet Too sweet Im surprised how the show Chefs table featured the worlds top restaurant Osteria Francescana in their episode 1 and Milk Bar in one of the other episode for pastry series They are clearly not at the same level This is my personal opinion I am sure there are fans who just love the taste But I truly doubt how this thing made Chefs table Since milk bar is part of momofuku group we also tried momofuku nextdoor and it was good,negative,136,100-150,739,500-1000
id rate 35 stars It was a cool experience but for the linewait it wasnt that good We ordered the bowls and paying 12 i couldve made this at home for 2 It tasted like a scoop of mayfield vanilla ice cream hersheys chocolate syrup and some cereal on top maybe a milkshake wouldve been the way to go but either way i could make these very easily at home,positive,70,50-75,371,<500
Yum yum YUM As a donut fanatic I had heard a lot of hype around the vegan doughnut company well before I went in for my first visit My friends and I planned to show up right at opening time 9 am on a beautiful Sunday morning  and when we got there the line was already AROUND THE BLOCK We waited in line for 40 minutes but the moment we got inside we knew the wait was worth it All their donuts were beautifully decorated and consisted of more traditional flavors but also more unique ones We ordered a box consisting of strawberry cream cookies  cream lemon lavender maple cream and more They were all SO GOOOD the donuts were delicious werent too overly sweet and I couldnt even tell that they were vegan My favorite flavor was the lemon lavendar because it was a nice combination of tart  sweet So before you go make sure to double check their hours since they are pretty limited and you should definitely try to show up early so the donut flavors you want dont run out In addition their menu is always changing so you should look at their website or instagram page too for those Fun fact The two cofounders attended the same high school I went to in the Cleveland area so that pretty awesome Will definitely continue supporting them and am excited to see their business continue to grow,positive,243,200-250,1332,1000-1500
Went into Amelies yesterday for a shot of espresso People behind the counter were friendly but the shot of espresso was overextracted pulled too long I used the wifi for a couple minutes and didnt finish the espresso as it was bitter and unpleasant I went in today to give the espresso another chance as they werent too far off from pulling a good shot and they had been friendly The same barista from the day before was working I politely asked the barista to pull the shot a little shorter as the one from yesterday was overextracted and a pretty bitter Instead of hearing an oh okay sure or an okay sorry about that I got a very condescending talk about how he probably used too much coffee and that it wasnt overextracted as it would have been sour If it was only his incorrect explanation of why yesterdays shot tasted bad Id be going back to Amelies again I love talking coffeeespresso extraction and would had started up a conversation about the subject He did pull this shot shorter than yesterdays and it was a good extraction The flavor of the shot wasnt my preference as it seemed to be a roast on the darker side of medium but the bitterness or astringency wasnt there this time Since he took an arrogant and condescending tone with me I wont be going back there again and am giving this establishment a 1 Star rating If that had not happened I would had given a 3 and revisited the location as correctly extracted espresso is in very short demand in Charlotte If the barista happens to read this here are some links so you can understand extraction correctly a hrefredirurlhttp3A2F2Fwwwhomebaristacom2Fespressoguidegoodextractionshtmlsf5f7a84678d287194b7ec2ec9e62bb9567f008a9f1b6fa5b07e64cc66d5094da target_blank relnofollowhomebaristacomespressa a hrefredirurlhttp3A2F2Fenwikipediaorg2Fwiki2FCoffee_extractions2c6158cd8b16e174011bc0288615dea63d504f54ee8fa97fc55912d446fe0b97 target_blank relnofollowenwikipediaorgwikiCoa Might also want to spend some time reading up on how to take criticism especially when it is constructive criticism,negative,316,300- 500,2160,2000+
Came here after eating at Buddys Vs Ristorante they had quite a lot to Choose from its a little on the pricey side so be prepared for that Can be crowded at times so its best to come out early when their shelves are fully stocked out and fresh Had the famous Lobster Tail it was highly recommended and it was great crispy on the outside very creamy on the inside also their connoli is good too Overall their process of getting in and out could be faster,positive,88,75-100,460,<500
So glad we waited in line for this place The line kind of took us for surprise However we are nearing the end of summer  school will soon resume This the fleet of teens babies  your daddy Upon getting to the top of the line the employees were so excited even after getting through the lines They were encouraging that we taste all the flavors we were interested about Again keep in mind the lines were long They were not pushy at all My roommates  I opted for the waffle cones you can smell from outside the establishment Its very sweet I love sweet but its definitely sweet I got a standard ooey gooey butter Im still on cloud nine you guys Then my bf couldnt finishso I devoured his strawberry buttermilk Living my best life All in all go to Jenis No doubt you will find something for you  the family Enjoy you guys,positive,159,150-200,855,500-1000

The staff are quick and efficient The shop is cute The fondant skills for the cake are amazing HOWEVER everything may look delicious but it wont taste it We waited in line for about 25 minutes and was truly disappointed We got One yellow cupcake with buttercream  cake was dry and frosting was flavorless One cream puff  The cream inside was once again flavorless and tasted like overcooked eggs The pastry part was not flakey at all One cup of strawberry shortcake  Besides the strawberry I toss the cup away The cake was once again dry and the whipped cream was flat A sprinkle cookie  It was okay Nothing worth the half hour wait We tossed most of the items away since it so bland If youre going to eat something bad for your health every bite better be worth it This was not worth it Its also overpriced and overcrowded yet sadly the pastries are underachieved,negative,161,150-200,894,500-1000
Awful If I want to start a horrible restaurant Im going to slap a French Bistro name on it so it sounds fancy They did a great job with social distance including the staff who distanced themselves in the back not to be seen Up front service was painfully slow My wife ordered a croissant and a overpriced 450 lemonade Simple enough I ordered an 8 chicken sandwich on a baguette Sounded great Didnt come with anything The guy at the counter asked us to step aside and wait for my sandwich which he said would take 510 minutes I thought I heard him incorrectly Just do the math in your head to build a sandwich with 4 ingredients The restaurant was dead 15 minutes later my fancy French sandwich came out It was tiny and the chicken was thin grilled pieces Some blue cheese crumples and bonjour The experience was horrible with a fancy accent over the e,negative,159,150-200,878,500-1000
The hype is UNREAL I would like to start off with saying I love cake All kinds of cake and my kids are a big fan of shakes and ice cream We ordered 3 items making our total a little under 40 The birthday cake shake is so plain and flat and tasteless Also it was not picture worthy Secondly the ice cream glad we took samples of all and we settled on the chocolate pretzel as the other two were pretty bad especially the cereal milk one And lastly the cake was sold out which gave us a feeling that it was that good We were offered a chance to wait an hour to get a slice and we agreed About 5 minutes later they let us know they actually had a slice available We came back to our hotel excited to enjoy our cake and wow what a disappointment It was colddry hard and just bleh in flavor I cannot believe they charge 14 for a single slice of cake Youd think they would make quality dessert to have customers coming back regardless of price,negative,187,150-200,958,500-1000
If I was basing my review on Milks notorious cake Id give them a four or five Overall the goodies I tried were pretty good but not showstoppers Older reviews noted that the Milk cake could not be purchased by the slice but on my recent visit it was available for purchase by the slice A win The cake was really good and for me nearly lived up to the hype The cake was moist and delicious The frosting was also delicious and there was just the right amount The slice was large and enough for two or three to share The chocolate malt truffles were rich and decadent with a fudge consistency inside These were also great Milk offers three truffle flavors and they are sold as three packs Id love to see them offer a variety pack with one of each flavor Since I can only eat so many sweets in one sitting I also purchased three cookies to enjoy at home The Compost Cookie was pretty good and not an overly sweet cookie The Confetti Cookie was my favorite of the three with delicious crunchy sprinkles The Corn Cookie tasted exactly as listed It was an interesting cookie and I couldnt decide if I liked it or not The corn offered a slight sweetness but kept it from being too sweet I had to think about how I felt about Milk after my visit and one thing stuck out to me that kept this from being a high rating Many of the items offered are prepackaged I cant get past the fact that they are selling most of their items already packaged and not fresh from the oven Especially bakery items at top price points The cake and truffles were worth it but Id pass on the cookies next time,positive,303,300- 500,1611,1500-2000
I went back and got the fruit tarts and chocolate cinnamon  pistachio macarons Friends I shared with said they were all super delicious I tried a bite of the peach tart and it was good Loved the crust and almond creamy base The staff members were definitely more helpful this time Labor Day mustve been an off day,positive,59,50-75,321,<500
I walked in one day wanting a slice of cake ok so I cant get with paying 7 for a slice of cake This is ridiculous There was also a customer who walked in after me with a dog on a lease Really Why would anybody bring a dog in a bakery I dont understand why someone think thats ok On the plus side the young lady behind the counter told him he had to take the dog outside I didnt buy the cake I thought it was to expensive Unfortunately the whole experience put a bad taste in my mouth I wont be back,negative,105,100-150,516,500-1000

If you want to pay 7 for a scoop of crunchy vanilla ice cream then this place might be for you I was utterly baffled by the concept of this place but curiosity got the better of me In hindsight the 450 bowl of cereal with milk should have been a major red flag While the first layer of caramel and brownies that topped my creation were admittedly rather tasty the crunchy mess below was immensely unsatisfying Im pretty confused by other reviews pointing out ample parking and competitive pricing which were not my experience at all,negative,97,75-100,550,500-1000
We have been in here a couple of times now Friendly and engaged owners who seem to have chef power when it comes to creativity and flavors Planning to go back this week and give some proper attention to detail and try some new things Winter ice cream seems right here due to the above average taste scale The tunes and atmosphere appeal to the neighborhood scene Helen and Jesse have found their niche I can see people driving across town to visit this place as the word begins to spread This is the ice cream you are looking for foodies,positive,101,100-150,550,500-1000
I give this place 4 solid stars because the place is a bit pricy What This place is open 24 hrs and 7 days a week Good news for mefor this is definitely a great place to satisfy my midnight cravings I ordered a French Soda two small fruit tarts and one Macaroon The Macaroon was chewy and perfectone of the best Ive tried so far The decor was quirky kind of reminded me of Marie Antoinette I had the most difficult time choosing what I wanted because EVERYTHING looked yummy The service was great and the atmosphere had a good vibe I will definitely be coming back and this I am bringing my 4 year old to have some Macaroons,positive,121,100-150,643,500-1000
Over rated I was very unimpressed Service was ok one lady was nice the other didnt smile at all the cupcakes werent that great I Tried the maple bacon which was gross and I have had maple and bacon before and loved it Also tried the red velvet which was better,negative,51,50-75,269,<500
Was recently in Vegas and wanted to drop by to visit the famous Carlos Bakery from Cake Boss It was actually very disappointing and a huge let down All I tried was the chocolate cannoli so maybe I didnt have the right thing but It was sold in a pack of 6 for 30 The favor was not there and it just tasted frozen It left a weird aftertaste too that was also unpleasant I would say Carlos Bakery is a pass,negative,82,75-100,414,<500
Since I visited both Bouchon Restaurant and Bouchon Bakery in Yountville I was hooked Once I learned they had shop in Vegas I knew I had to stop in there during my last visit to Sin City Before checking out of the Palazzo I headed over to the Venetian to order some goodies from Bouchon Bakery The line was wrapping around their little bakery station in the corner of the casino I had a hard time deciding what I wanted to order just by looking at their display of goodies behind the glass cases Finally I decided on the following a turkey and brie sandwich a carrot cake cookie a cheese danish chocolate croissant and a small coffee Yes all of where were for just myself Im a glutton  My boyfriend had already left and took an earlier flight home so I was able to spoil myself with these yummy treats Everything was deeeeelish I would definitely be returning for more sugary carby heaven,positive,165,150-200,910,500-1000
The best service and great ice cream The owner was so sweet and welcoming We had the oatmeal cookie ice cream and it was awesome Cant wait to come back,positive,30,25-50,157,<500
I really dont understand the hype about this place My boyfriend suggested we try Milk Bar to try their infamous Birthday Cake dessert treats since we were both in Vegas for the weekend celebrating our joint Birthdays But after reading the mixed reviews we decided we couldnt stomach paying 14 for a single slice of cake and instead opted for the Birthday Trio of Truffles which were still 2 a pop The Birthday Truffles were really underwhelming so Im glad we didnt buy the cake A truffle is toughly the size of a donut hole and it tasted like cookie dough with some sprinkles in it It was really sweet and I definitely needed some milk to wash it downOverall Im not a huge fan of overly sweet American desserts so Milk Bar didnt strike my fancy Prices are too expensive for dessert and theres really nothing special with the desserts to write home about,negative,155,150-200,877,500-1000
Alison was absolutely incredible She served us while we were there She is so passionate about her job and really made our experience there unforgettable The restaurant is blessed to have her What a beautifully unique atmosphere AmÃlies is Coffee is superb as well as their pastries and food Loved it A must place to eat while in Charlotte,positive,59,50-75,350,<500
I love the show Cake Boss and always wanted to give his treats a try I finally had the chance too but Im so disappointed It didnt live up to the hype Carlos Bakery was getting I went during Christmas and the line was surprisingly short I ordered a few things 4 and my total was nearly 30 so overpriced and didnt taste good  Oreo Cupcake  810 best thing Ive tried It was about 35 Decent flavor and moist cake but nothing special  Chocolate Dipped cheesecake  410 it was about the size of my palm and it was over 10 Very expensive for a tiny cheesecake with barely any flavorful The thin chocolate shell was the only flavor profile the cheesecake had no flavor and there wasnt even a crust  Original Cannoli  210 absolutely never again The shell was hard and had a weird flavor There was soooo much cream that also had a weird flavor It was kinda dry and overall disappointing  Lobster tail  510 I thought it would be flakey but when it bit into it it was hard The cream doesnt have flavor so this wasnt worth 7 No flavor and hard,negative,203,200-250,1080,1000-1500
Was also promised a gift card for my troubles over 4 weeks ago Guess what never showed up Par for the course I guess,negative,24,<50,120,<500
Came here after a certain unnamed place was sold out for the day Lucky for us it was a Tuesday and scoops are only 250 I decided on a red raspberry sherbet on a sugar cone My husband chose chocolate chip cookie dough in a cup My 6 year old opted for a chocolate milkshake Thanks to the deal this was just about 10 for the 3 of us The red raspberry was cold sweet creamy and full of raspberry goodness everything but the seeds The chocolate chip cookie dough was also creamy the bites of cookie dough soft and buttery The chocolate shake was huge see photo for comparison against 40 oz water bottle and it was malty chocolatey goodness without tasting syrupy like some milkshakes do Would we come back Definitely and most likely on a Tuesday again There is a plethora of flavors that can last me a whole year of Tuesdays to try them all,positive,159,150-200,860,500-1000
I have to say that this is definitely the best Gelato I have ever had This place has an amazing atmosphere and the people there are amazing They use organic ingredients and their flavors are truly amazing The new owner has taken this place to a whole new amazing level and are really really good people I am excited to see Fatty Daddys grow and flourish How could they not Thank you for the awesome experience Ari O,positive,78,75-100,424,<500
Ive started this review multiple times but words always seem to fall short and feel inadequate to describe this true diamond in the steel buckle of the rust belt First the owner of the shop isnt the absentee kind Hes a mad genius behind the counter creating dare I say it sinfully delectable chocolate creations that befuddle the mind Not to mention hes a genuinely nice guy who exudes a true passion for his chocolate Now you can have your Mr Wizard Bill Nye or Dr Frankenstein but he is a true mad scientist with his dark and milk chocolate alchemy I mean chocolate covered bacon scumdiddlyumptious truffles milk shakes spun by hand with what could be termed interesting but delicious ice cream offerings and my personal favorite the chocolate enveloped peanut butter loved rice crispy treats Now add to all of this incredible edible chocolateconfectionery is the staff Not only do you find yourself in hand crafted amazing chocolaty goodness but you have a collection of friendly fun fantastic folks to guide you into the plethora of choices that will leave you weak in the knees and begging for mercy to tear into the amazing bag of goodies youre sure to leave with I cant stop getting enough of the amazing treats great people and I almost forgot to mention with the cold setting in to Pittsburgh their mind blowing game changing dare I say soul warming hot chocolate sure to melt away the frostbite nipping at your nose toes and stomach With so many options of Sinful Sweets to choose from I will have to keep visiting again and again and again,positive,274,250-300,1587,1500-2000

Famous cupcakes shop originally from LA area It is just OK Not even close to Nomelie Cupcakes of Parker Colorado These cupcakes are sprinkles had vanilla red velvet chocolate and snicker doodle are Not moist and flavorful Too much hype but nothing to back up Disappointing,negative,46,25-50,284,<500
Worst service ever and was told they are out of canollis at Carlos Bakery and the person behind the counter with pink hair was horrible,negative,25,<50,135,<500
I came for a gettogether with a few friends and I enjoyed the quaint decor and presentation of the sweet treats There is a surprising amount of seating for the size of the location Street parking was readily available nearby I did not have the best experience due to understaffing there was only one individual working and she was having a difficult time keeping up with the orders I was also not a fan of my hot chocolate which as you can see in the photo was served in 3 containers When I received it it was cold and the staff was unavailable for me to notify her The icing on my cupcake was incredibly rich that it was difficult to eat the entire thing The friends I was with had the same issue with the slices of cake that they ordered I will be giving it another chance hoping that my disappointment was just based on the understaffing,negative,159,150-200,853,500-1000
I requested for a mixed berry tart to be warmed up In the past the servers advise that they normally dont warm it up but they gladly assist with my request The manager refused to warm it up this time because it falls apart I advised that I was the customer and that I was willing to take the chance because the tart has never fallen apart and that it wasnt an issue if it did The manager refused once more and showed no type of interest in keeping my business Very disappointing experience at this location and with the current staff for a simple request I wouldnt recommend this location Needless to say I didnt purchase the tart,negative,119,100-150,644,500-1000
I bought two cupcakes here and I was terribly disappointed The cake was dry and rather lacking in flavor I am afraid that a Target cupcake was fresher I would not buy a cupcake here again,negative,36,25-50,191,<500
This place is the best in Vegas Love the donuts and the service is just awesome Always bring a box of donuts home when I visit Vegas They sold out quick and during weekends they have the best French toast made out of donut yes it is the best,positive,49,25-50,241,<500
Location is small and cute The Gelato is delicious Having a macaroon on top of ice cream is interesting It became a bit chewier than I expected but nonetheless still good They have Boba and coffee but their mainstay is their ice cream gelato If you are close by it is def worth a visit,positive,55,50-75,291,<500
Not 31 flavors more like 10 but the Best ice cream in Phoenix hands down Similar to BiRite in San Francisco or Bobtail in Chicago Its in a strange little area but will worth it,positive,35,25-50,183,<500
I use to love this place But with the new management I dont enjoy the environment anymore,negative,17,<50,92,<500
Ok For 1756 I got 2 macaroon salted brownie and eclair small coffee My wife wanted a vanilla latte one pump of vanilla she does not love it very sweet She asked the man for the one pump and he said no it must have three pumps and they can not change it customer service is a basic requirement now and losing a customer for such a senseless issue is a problem And honesty people its way to expensive for the common person I think its somewhat snotie Also coffee was not that great Duncan donuts had better coffee and service and that is a problem,negative,106,100-150,559,500-1000
This place is the best Ice Cream Ive ever had I saw it on Best Things I Ever Ate recommended by Alton Brown That was a year agoI havent had ice cream from anywhere else since Ive had sundaes cookies scoops brittle and cones My favorites are Bleu Cheese Honey and I Heart Bacon The Sweet Corn one I had the other day is a close contender as well The Bacon Brittle is an absolute must Ive bought a couple bags and its always gone rather quickly The homemade toasted marshmallows are to die for I could eat them all day,positive,101,100-150,538,500-1000

The pastries were fabulous Especially the lobster tails However trying to buy gift cards for a wedding present was a nightmare It took three trips to get them I finally did I emailed Carlos Bakery letting them know Took forever to get a response When I did they said someone from the location contact me No one did I emailed again Someone emailed offering to sent me the gift card sleeves even after I advised that I had given the gift The last email advised that they were sending me the sleeves and two coupons for a free cannoli To be used at any location Yeah WaitI live in CA  there is no location here Got the coupons todays Not only are they for a location we dont have they expire in three months So much for the attention to detail they rave about on the show,negative,148,100-150,796,500-1000
Ordered a crepe with strawberry banana and Nutella and have to be honest I was slightly disappointed in the taste and quality I think the venue itself made for a great atmosphere however the food didnt feel as amped as I was expecting it to be My rating could also be a result of eating crepes in Europe and so my level of standard could be higher than the norm,negative,70,50-75,368,<500
Cant think of a better place to go get a sweet treat on a warm summer day I would highly recommend Sweet Republic to anyone looking too cool down with some amazing ice cream,positive,34,25-50,176,<500
This place is very hipster I had the strawberry basil sorbet it was very refreshing and delicious My friend had Oh My  Affogato has her wired this place has a laid back atmosphere,positive,34,25-50,186,<500
Soooooooo disappointed in the cupcakes I bought last night Bought 4 large and 2 mini about 20 Ate the minis on the way to the car they were fine Although I had to remove some of the frosting even on the small ones it is pretty sweet Got the big ones out for dessert tonight and could NOT finish a whole cupcake They were so dry I was shocked And the frosting to cake ratio was for me off To SWEET Or maybe it was the dry flavorless cake that was the problem I thought this product was baked on sight Needless to say for the price I wont be going back,negative,112,100-150,568,500-1000
Really good donuts  But dont let your eyes be bigger than your stomach their donuts are huge  Super soft  great customer service,positive,25,<50,133,<500
You may have noticed the long lines and that this place is always bustling Its for a good reason I came here a few times with my parents and they loved it just going crazy choosing various baked goodies to try For the most part Ive loved it all fresh yummy and affordable I also took friends from Europe and Latin America and they all loved it as well The whole smell of the place when you walk in is inviting and delicious High ceilings plenty of space to sit and excellent service to boot Every interaction Ive had with the servers were friendly and pleasant Yesterday I went back to the register to ask for a copy of my receipt that I couldnt find and they were very kind and patient and printed me out a new copy despite being busy My friend and I sat in the airy dining area and had a great time sampling the pastries and talking I wish they had a selfserving water station though as the water cups were the size of shotglasses and pastries make me thirsty,positive,185,150-200,986,500-1000
EXCELLET ICE CREAM AND DONUTS got the Madagascar flavored ice cream if you like vanilla bean this is the place that everyone should go,positive,24,<50,139,<500
Went to carlos for the first time and purchased 12 dozen lobster tails as well as some chocolate covered strawberries I had really been looking forward to trying the famous lobster tails only to be beyond disappointed I dont know if I received an old batch given that Ive visited the bakery at 1030am but they were leathery and tough I had expected a light crispy flaky pastry and this was not that by any means The only redeeming quality of them was the pastry cream inside The chocolate covered strawberries were decent just like any other chocolate covered strawberry you could get from any other bakery in town there wasnt anything special about them,negative,115,100-150,666,500-1000
This place needs to be called out because what happened to us tonight was not okay My friends and I were ignored by the server behind the counter tall lanky guy with darkblonde curly hair working on 104 at 7PM He clearly saw us waiting patiently for him to finish with the party he was serving When he continued to ignore us and serve 3 Caucasian groups that had walked in after us I came to the sad realization that we were being ignored because we were nonwhite Im Asian and was with Asian and middle eastern friends When I tried to bring to his attention that we were actually next we continued to be ignored This ignorant and disrespectful occurrence left a sour taste in my mouth and ruined our night no place is worth patronizing for this display no matter how good the ice cream is We left empty handed and will never come back,negative,157,150-200,857,500-1000
So Im sad to report that I was extremely disappointed in my first visit to Milk Bar Las Vegas After all the hype surrounding Christina Tosis success and her legendary Birthday Cake how could I not try it First they served the cake cold Do you know what happens to buttercream frosting when its refrigerated Exactly it solidifies So they essentially served us solid butter fat Total and complete sin against nature Second the crumb which is supposed to be moist from the milk soak was dry and crumbly to the point that it broke apart under the weight of the fork Third the cake layers were flavorless And fourth the 15 layers of frosting between the cake layers was too much too cold too solid Almost inedible The corn flakemarshmallowchocolate chip cookie wasnt much better To top it all off either the cake the cookie or a combination of the two left an unpleasant aftertaste in both our mouths Totally not worth the 19 spent Highly overrated,negative,168,150-200,983,500-1000
One of my favorite donut places in Cleveland Super well priced and so delicious What I love about Jack Frost is the donuts are on the smaller size so you can try a bunch of different flavors and not feel sick after They have a bunch of unique flavors as well outside of your typical glazed and maple Highly recommend this place to anyone in the area,positive,67,50-75,354,<500
I really wanted to like this place being a fan of the Cake Boss show The pastries in the display looked delicious But the looks were deceiving The pastries were dry and just soso Even the famous cannolis were disappointing Worst of all they neglected to put the almond croissant I had ordered and paid for in the box they handed me By the time I realized this I was already on my way out of Vegas Mediocre pastries at an expensive price No wonder there were no other customers when I arrived at the store,negative,96,75-100,517,500-1000
Had the strawberry and it wasnt good It tasted old and like the carton it comes in Im an ice cream lover and I eat all ice cream but this one I just couldnt finish,negative,35,25-50,169,<500

Stopped at Sprinkles for a 4 cupcake while cruising the strip Gals working the counter were not overly friendly it was more like I was inconveniencing them with my order AND the cupcake wasnt good Cake was hard and the icing was too sweet With all the great treat options in Vegas this one can be skipped,negative,57,50-75,313,<500
Not worth it My husband and I stopped by and got a vanilla cupcake with buttercream icing and a slice of chocolate cake Cupcake I would much rather have a Walmart cupcake The icing had no flavor and the cupcake had to of been a day or two old it was soo dry Chocolate cake it was moist but lacked something The service was good everyone was friendly and helpful Needless to say I was so disappointed I had high hopes for this place,negative,84,75-100,443,<500
I wanted to pick up a hostess gift for the person were staying with on vacation I purchased a Groupon 30 truffles for 30 I called Sinful Sweets to ask questions the guy was polite but had no idea how to help me I emailed them but I didnt receive a response Then I went to the store to purchase the truffles I NEVER go downtown but I figured Id use the Groupon and then meet my husband after he got off work When I talked to the young lady she said they need 24 hours notice to use the Groupon Were standing next to a full display of truffles while I asked a few questions The lady said the Groupon says they need 24 hours notice but there is literally nothing about that on the Groupon or when I purchased it I told the young lady I was leaving for vacation tomorrow and didnt have time for this I asked for a manager but there was none available so I left Not only do I have a Groupon for 30 I cant use but I decided not to purchase the other items I was going to get in addition to that While Sinful Sweets has delicious chocolate their customer service is horrible Im very disappointed they made using the Groupon so difficult Needless to say I will not be purchasing from them again and I will not reccomend them to anyone else,negative,243,200-250,1267,1000-1500
It is very rare for me to like something for a long period of time I move on too quick you could say but ice cream has always been my goto dessert Like many people Im especially a fan of ice cream that includes surprises inside like cookies and cream rocky road pistachio ect You can imagine my excitement when I heard that there was an establishment that created custom cerealice cream mixtures Although feeling skeptical at first as soon as I walked in I was greeted by young cheerful workers and soothing lofi music with an occasional pop hit here and there The wall facing customers when they enter the store is decorated with leaves and lit up neon lights that spell Dripp it like its hot an original idea that adds a classy ambience to the shop also perfect for taking pictures The store isnt very big but the furnishings are strategically placed to make it feel roomy and it also gives customers the option to enjoy their ice cream sitting on stools padded chairs a patio or even a couch The oddly satisfying thing about this establishment is that the temperature inside isnt so cold to the point where you feel rushed to leave a quality that is hard to find with many other ice cream shops in the area If you tend to have a hard time making decisions when presented with a bunch of choices then youll be relieved to hear that there are six signature options which feature the most popular mixes so that you dont end up making a bad mix Thunder buddies is my personal favorite which features Reeses puffs bananas almonds and teddy bear graham crackers Truthfully I thought that the ice cream wouldnt be much different from that of Cold Stone or any other ice cream competitor but the cereal gave the ice cream a crunch that can be best described by my significant other as heavenly They also gave the ice cream to me exactly as it had appeared on the menu we could see the workers placing the teddy bear crackers on their feet in the ice cream While Ive never been a fan of chocolate covered cones people have the option to have their cone dipped in blue or pink chocolate or both for an extra dollar I found it funny at first but they also have an option to buy a bowl of any of the cereal options for 450 Even though that may seem like an unfair price for a bowl of cereal it makes sense when you realize how desperate someone would have to be to pay 450 for a bowl of cereal when they could get a whole box for 300 The ice cream cones and milkshakes however are a bit more on the pricey side and cost me 595 before tax Keeping the bowls of cereal in mind you could just go to a supermarket and buy a whole tub of ice cream for the same price BUT you wouldnt easily be able to make a cerealice cream as fresh and crunchy as what Dipps gives you For the experience quality and price I would recommend this place for most occasions including dates family outings and especially on cheat day,positive,548,500+,2981,2000+

Their vanilla macaron was the best thing I ate in Vegas which included Wynn Buffet Aloha Kitchen BLT rm Seafood 350 isnt so bad because theyre larger than most macarons Ive seen They sell a 5 pack with all of their macaron flavors for 1650 The carrot cake cookie sandwich 350 was very big and I liked how it didnt have raisins No complaints Id stay away from their red velvet cupcakes They have a strange filling and the cake had too much cocoa Tasted more like a chocolate cupcake more than anything,positive,93,75-100,525,500-1000
waited 25 minutes for a milkshake eventually gave up and asked to just cancel my order for a refund manager gave me a refund and did say sorry but did not seem really sincere nor care for making up for it its too bad I was really excited to try their shakes there was a huge group of people waiting along with me as well and quite a few were getting very impatient and making comments so I know I wasnt the only one who was upset,negative,87,75-100,437,<500
Came here on Tuesday First time The ice cream was GREAT the location is good  the place was over all clean My only issue was they had maybe 6 people working because they CAN get very very busy This time around 5pm on Tuesday they were not very busy so some of the people working were just standing around Which again Idc not a big deal my friend  i ordered our ice cream  sat down on the bar stool area that faces inside the ice cream shop One of the employees took a taster spoon and samples a flavor ok nothing wrong with that He then used the same spoon and dipped it back into the ice cream to take another sample so double dipped into the ice cream he was serving the customers I continued to watch him  he did this TWICE SAME SPOON NOT sanitary  Im not sure they should even be eating as customers are walking up to order  Makes me think twice about coming back If this is happening right in front of customers whats happening behind the scenes  granted because we were sitting outside facing the inside of the store maybe he didnt think anyone was watching,negative,209,200-250,1102,1000-1500
The level of customer service has really gone down No one greeted my sister and I upon our arrival We were looking around and waiting for about 10 minutes before being offered any help with just ordering two scoops of ice cream The energy the employees was far from inviting Ice cream was not good Just rude and a lot of attitude that was uncalled for,negative,66,50-75,357,<500
Kudos to AmÃlies for furnishing their bakery with purchases from the Habitat Restore I ordered chocolate bread pudding and it came out simultaneously burnt and cold  the outside was charred and the inside was cold From the little that I tasted I could tell that actually reheating it properly wouldnt make it much better Employee kindly gave me a refund My boyfriend enjoyed his chocolate croissant but I didnt care for his chocolate cakemousse dessert Would come back to try lunch sandwiches and a salted caramel brownie,negative,88,75-100,533,500-1000

When I got here there were two other customers in the store plus myself I figured it would be quick to get a cold sandwich After waiting 20 minutes after ordering I finally got my sandwich When I got home I found that the one single alteration I made no Mayo was not done So this Wednesday night I get to eat an overpriced sandwich that I waited 20 minutes on that tastes like a jar of Mayo I would not recommend,negative,82,75-100,420,<500

When we drove into the city we didnt expect any place to be open for dinner after 9 pm but somehow we stumbled upon this bakery The interior is so cute and very spacious This bakery is open very late which is super convenient We ordered the turkey and brie sandwich and the pate sandwich I HIGHLY recommend the pate sandwich For dessert the pistachio cranberry petit gateau and the creme brÃlÃe are very tasty on its own or paired with red wine Must try if youre in the mood for sweets or a quick eat in the city,positive,99,75-100,526,500-1000
Ok this place has SOOOO much selection They have retail too and candy for sale Excellent service and great ice cream,positive,21,<50,122,<500
The service was great but the actual desserts are mediocre I sampled the famous milk ice cream that tasted like day old Frosted Flakes which just wasnt very good So I ended up just jumping in and ordered the vanilla cake with sprinkles in it Another sad disappointment The reviews posted on here are true I was shocked when I read them that is why I still tried this place I had to discover that the rumors were to bad to be true,negative,83,75-100,442,<500
This place seems busy usually but I cant understand why It was dead tonight Sunday at 730 pm Ive been here three times and it seems like the employees never know what they are doing Whats strange is they leave the dippers in the freezer which makes it impossible to scoop the ice cream Each time I watch them struggle with trying to scoop the ice cream and get it out of the dipper Have they never heard of a dip well that you leave the dippers in that trickles water so the scoops are always rinsed Tonight I got a banana split which is supposed to be a split banana hence banana split laid along the side of the three scoops in the container but only got a few slices dropped in beside the ice cream Then he put the whipped cream on first before the toppings Common sense should tell you this is wrong for anyone whos ever seen a picture of a banana split but hes an untrained teen so I cant blame him For toppings only a very awful tasting over portioned crushed pineapple and crushed maraschino cherries Absolutely awful And then no chocolate syrup and no nuts Then he hands me the open container with the pineapple and crushed cherries spilling alldown the side from where he ineptly tried to put the toppings along side of the ice cream and whipped cream Cant put it on top whip cream came first The last time I was there I got a hot fudge sundae and also no nuts and a smidgen of fudge The way it looks is always unappealing This is what happens when you turn your store over to be run by teenagers with attitude They really dont care about what they are serving and when youre looking for a sweet treat to lift you up its quite frustrating to be served this crap They opened this store in a nice neighborhood with families that have probably a little more than the average families expendable income If they provided a better customer experience better product and presentation they could get away with charging more Serving poor quality product and giving poor service just because the price is low is not a mixture for success I doubt Ill be back there,negative,386,300- 500,2105,2000+
Solid cake They have it all ready to go and it travels well My family was not disappointed when I walked in with slices for them,positive,26,25-50,131,<500

Chicory Coffee with Toffee Honey deserves the descriptive term AMAZEBALLS I almost passed up on the flavor but my ice cream partner chose it as his flavor for our double scoop cup and Im glad he did I chose the Sichuan pepper and chocolate combo which was fun and novel but we both found ourselves eating around it vying for the last bites of the Chicory Coffee with Toffee Honey,positive,70,50-75,385,<500
Need a little smarter girls working in here Waited for 10 min and kept going to friends to see what they wanted Sunday night Needs help A line or number system would be a smart move,negative,36,25-50,199,<500
Yummy yummy yummy We waited outside for about 15 minutes in line There is no seating inside unless youre probably eating at the Windsor You can even try samples which is awesome Got the kids scoop butter pecan and it is BOMB,positive,42,25-50,232,<500
Been here twice and loved it each time The ice cream is truly incredible I havent found another ice cream shop in AZ that matches its quality To top it off both times Ive been in the owner has been working and he will let you take your time to ask questions and try as many flavors as you want You can tell he just wants you to have the best experience possible I cant say enough good things about this place its definitely worth trying out,positive,87,75-100,452,<500
We got the chocolate cake malt It was an okay drink It tasted like chocolate with chunks of like a cookie doughchocolate chip chunks in it The malt couldve also have been more prominent For 10 I was expecting something special I guess the price is just because the place is on the strip The malt I make at home are much better than what they gave usI would not go back,negative,72,50-75,379,<500
Terrible experience My fiancÃ and I are getting married in exactly 2 weeks and wanted to have Donut Bar cater a section with donuts in Las Vegas She had emailed them in the beginning of the year and didnt get a response I had to stop there when I was in Las Vegas to personally get information about what we wanted They took my information and then I followed up with them to get the figures After getting that squared away I was told to get them paid for about 23 weeks prior to the event I emailed them to have someone call me to take payment no response then called today to give them my card and the person on the phone was authorized to do so and he person that was wasnt available for about 3 hours I left my name and number for them to call me back and never did By far the worst customer service Ive seen in a while when a person is trying to give you money I wouldnt recommend using Donut Bar to cater any event in fear of them not getting back to you when time is of the essence,negative,199,150-200,1008,1000-1500
Oh Mitchells How I love thee Weve only lived in the area since June We found Mitchells on the way to the lake sometime at the end of June and weve been back three times within the last 23 weeks Number four may be tonight The coffee chocolate chip is calling my name Did I mention I dont even usually like ice cream,positive,63,50-75,331,<500
I dont know why there is so much hype about this place I was initially amped like everyone else but was sadly put down in the blink of an eye I guess living In LA for the past four years really spoiled me because of the myriad of donut shops Ive tried there Donut bar is different from all the donut shops in Vegas I do have to say They offer donuts the size of your face flavor combinations that are unique and esthetics so pretty you dont want to eat them Unfortunately I cant say the same about the texture The texture was not as moist as I had anticipated With every bite I had to wash it down with some water We came at noon and maybe the donuts were sitting there for a couple hours But that should not be a valid excuse for a shop specializing in donuts They close at 1pm or when all the donuts are sold out Would I come here again probably not Sorry donut bar but you can do better,negative,179,150-200,912,500-1000
I used to love the show and Buddy is always talking about doing a great customer service well thats exactly the opposite of what I got many employees  but not being able to handle customers when I was asked for my name I spelled it  an Italian name on a Italian owned business and the employee changed my name on purpose joking that it would be easier to say  when I said I would consider that offensive she laughed on me I was about to explode at that time when she called me wrong again and when I literally asked what the heck is wrong with you she started to say Im sorry  in between laughs In the end I really didnt like the canoli  one of my very favorites pastries too heavy the lobster tail is very decent will return Absolutely not not even when in Hoboken VERY disappointed Watching the man give other owners words of wisdom on how to improve their business he could use some of those words on his own business By the way he was inside  talking to employees and not even a smile to the crowd outside I think friendliness is just for TV,negative,207,200-250,1111,1000-1500
Love it sometimes the lines are long but the wait is worth it plus the outside scenery is definitely a vibe,positive,21,<50,109,<500
Trying to call them for allergy question and it goes straight to an automatic system Not driving 30 min to find out if they have plant base option or not,negative,30,25-50,154,<500
I dont understand all the hype Maybe I had high expectations after all I am a regular at The Cupcakery But anyway I had the red velvet  the triple cinnamon cupcakes The red velvet was not impressive to me the frosting was too sweet and the cake itself just lacked flavor I will say that the cinnamon one was pretty delicious though Service was good but overall its not a place I would seek out if I were in need of sugar Maybe next time Ill try the ice cream which I hear is a better option,negative,98,75-100,505,500-1000
I love the environment and the all of the food options available It is pretty crowded most of the time and sometimes the line will be quite long but if you have the time I would definitely wait so worth the time I love their dessert options especially their creme brulee Will always return for more and would suggest it to others,positive,62,50-75,334,<500
Small desert spot with huge portions of a diverse array of unique deserts Have a wide variety of ice cream flavors and homemade waffle cones I got the salted caramel ice cream and the chocolate chip ice cream in a waffle cone and it was delicious The cone was a little stale however Unfortunately do not have any seating 8510,positive,60,50-75,332,<500
So disappointing Waited in line for 20 minutes and was so excited to try this place out but it was terrible I tried the eclair and the sprinkle cookie The sprinkle cookie had zero flavor The eclair had the perfect consistency of custard to pastry to chocolate but again no flavor Definitely not with the 6,negative,56,50-75,312,<500
I threw my ice cream in the trash Thats how much I disliked it It just wasnt worth the calories I would ingest trying to finish it The compost cookie was interesting with all its various ingredients but part of the texture was off and somewhat offputting Lastly the crack pie was extremely sweet and seemed predominately butter and sugar I liked this best but I also felt like I was slowly killing myself with each bite Tip share it with someone else,negative,83,75-100,465,<500
There are plenty of coffee shops in the  No Da area however you can not go wrong with hitting up this place  AmÃlies is by far the BEST there is And to the Emilys  Emily F and Emily E  you 2 rock  To management these two are stellar employees that represent your business with great personalities and are extremely friendly and make you feel as a friend and less like just a customer EmilysRock SuperStars Amelies,positive,81,75-100,434,<500
We waited in a very long line because had heard the hype about this place Only two not very friendly ladies working and they were overwhelmed I could see Okay then they ran out of lids and she could go downstairs if I wanted her to Well no not with a line out the door Anyways ice cream was pretty decent Vanilla chocolate chip cookie dough and black raspberry truffle Would I wait again like that for it No probably not Id go to Masons Creamery on Bridge Street where ice cream is just as good if not better and the service is so much friendlier,negative,106,100-150,567,500-1000
Really unique menu selection We were told the crack pie was a must try but sadly they didnt have any available I did try their signature cereal milk in a latte and it was incredibly different A little sweet a little salty  somehow theyve been able to replicate the taste of milk leftover from cereal perfectly Definitely worth trying,positive,60,50-75,343,<500
Oh my lanta  this place is amazing Recently stopped in while visiting friends in Charlotte and was blown away We did have a little bit of a wait only one group was allowed in the shop at a time due to COVID but it was WELL worth the wait The aroma of the shop grabs you as soon as you walk in the door The gals behind the counter were so friendly and helpful and patient with us while we figured out what we wanted I wish I hadnt just had a cup of coffee and could have gotten some here but Ill save that for another time I ordered the Lobster Tail WOW and a couple macarons  everything was amazing and I will most certainly be stopping back during my next CLT visit,positive,136,100-150,684,500-1000
This morning was my first time going in here I had heard so much about it I had to go in Unfortunately the woman with blondebrown curly hair in a ponytail in the front was so annoyed by me being there I literally didnt even have time to look at the donuts before rushing out a decision as she was wide eyeing and huffing at me Granted for the first moment I was on the phone in order to VERIFY DONUT ORDERS for other people god forbid I purchase more from them To which I got quite the eye roll from the lady If the donut I rushed out an answer to get because she made me so nervous to browse the selection as I had NEVER BEEN HERE before wasnt so good I wouldve given one star There was one person in line in front of me it wasnt busy so why seem so bothered to the point youre rolling your eyes at a customer because they arent sure what they want Ive never been there how can I know if I dont have the chance to look with out being made to feel bad by their employee I cant believe the customer service in Vegas is so poor when its a customer service town So disappointed at my experience here when Ive heard so many good things mustve had bad luck and caught the wrong employee on the wrong day I suppose,negative,244,200-250,1237,1000-1500
Waited 25 minutes here to grab 1 cannoli to go No regrets Very family friendly and date friendly establishment for a yummy treat in Little Italy Most guests enjoyed a pastrycake with coffee at tea Adorable,positive,36,25-50,211,<500
This is the best cake I have ever had The cake is so moist and the icing so light it melts in your mouth I always get the mini cakes because they are just perfect I havent found anything that compares in Pittsburgh but I will keep you posted,positive,49,25-50,247,<500
My friends daughter wanted a rainbow cake and came across Carlos Bakery with so many pics that showcased alot of that So she ordered one from here We were celebrating both our kids bday thats a day apart and figured for both to have similar cakes yet different and ordered from here as well Although 50 for a small simple 6 inch bday cake was the most I ever paid for for what you get i figured coming from Venetian and a celebrity chef which i was told couldnt go wrong but boy was I wrong Looks cute and pretty for the kids but thats all there is to it The cake was no different than what I would get at a supermarket or costco so to speak but for 3x the cost Its as if i could have slapped a bunch of sprinkles on it myself and add a celebrity name to it and charge others triple Bottom line it was dense WAY overly sweet and dry Last thing we need is our kids any more hyper than they already are and many trips to the dentist which will add to that cost of this cake Quite disappointed coming from a celebrity chef named behind it Perhaps he needs to find another sous chef or another bakery to represent as this does not look good On the defense perhaps its just the cake and other treats they have are better but with this costly experience that was not even close to edible it makes us hesitate to try other things Let say for 2 small 6in cakeswe have half the cake of each leftover and the slice we each had on our plates were half eaten was how bad it was for our whole party No one not one person enjoyed it Actually even a 4 year old didnt even care for it saying it was not soft and moist enough which is bad So I am surprised at the crazy long line other reviewers have stated as it is over rated and overly priced for what you get Sorry but not sorry Thank you but no thank you,negative,360,300- 500,1827,1500-2000
Minus 1 star Service was crappy and Ice cream was even worse For 750 we got horrible ice cream with soggy cereal an extremely salty yes salty marshmallow and a below average thin half of a cookie Would never recommend,negative,40,25-50,230,<500
Milk Bar looked delicious but the taste was absolutely DISGUSTING We ordered the funnel cake soft serve absolutely gross didnt taste like it at all or anything good and we immediately threw it away The gluten free birthday cake truffles these were prepackaged in groups of 3 so no mixmatch and they were slightly better than the soft serve But overall it was a waste of 16,negative,67,50-75,386,<500
Not the most exceptional cupcake weve ever had They werent light and fluffy like I would have expected but rather thick and heavy with a sweeter frosting than I would desire Overall for what we spent Id choose a different option the next time we visit,negative,46,25-50,259,<500
This was our first visit to Milk bar and overall we had a good experience We ordered the greatest hits so we could try all of the most popular items and we also got a special knights milkshake I was shocked in a good way at how good the cereal milk soft serve was My boyfriend adored the knights shake but the taste of the scotch was a little too strong for me The reason we gave it 4 stars was due to the fact that the space is really small and crowded which made us feel awkward and rushed The line even on a Sunday evening was really long Although it did move fairly quickly,positive,116,100-150,586,500-1000
I loved going to this little ice cream shop but ever since they changed their location their service and quality have gone downhill The ice cream is still good but theyve always got a low stock The ice cream isnt as instaworthy as it used to be I miss the old Melt,negative,52,50-75,273,<500

The lines and prices are outrageous and honestly i never understood the hype of cereal milk which is the grossest cloying sweet concoction of sour spoiled milk dredged in fruity pebbles overnight the Crack pie is an all butter mess too I like masterchef but rather have joe bastianich than the utterly joyless christina tosi How do you make desserts for a living and look like you just sucked on a bag of lemons all day Anyway dont waste your time here unless you love bs hype trendy hipster nonsense long lines spending tons of money on subpar ingredients and disgustingly sweet over the top confections likely to benefit noone but my family dentist,negative,114,100-150,654,500-1000
Ive been here three times already and like most people I came to expect the same if not close to the same quality of baked goods as the ones in California Both times their either out of the popular items or the breads are either slightly burned or under done It could just be my experience hence the two stars Im hoping theyll improve as time goes otherwise its not worth the 10 mile drive to chinatown for underwhelming pastry that are 2 or more dollars each,negative,87,75-100,466,<500
The food here is insanely good The tai tea macaron ice cream sandwich is delicious and the service is nice as well,positive,22,<50,116,<500
I went here for the first time on a Saturday and was surprised at how quickly my party was able to order our ice cream The people working were all friendly and the ice cream was very good Definitely worth the hype I heard about it The GLBC porter ice cream was delicious as were the other flavors we enjoyed Although I usually avoid 25th street I think I Will have to make more stops just for the awesome ice cream,positive,81,75-100,419,<500

Overrated soft serves shakes and cookies Their marketing team definitely deserves some recognition though Everything from installing those ig worthy neon lights signage to choosing the prime location inside Cosmo Great work to those guys At the end of the day save yourself the  and head over to McDonalds instead,negative,51,50-75,323,<500
Picture said it all It seems to me cream was not properly mixed so when I took off the cover icing came off with side cover with it And as far as taste They used to have really soft tasting cake but not recommendable anymore,negative,45,25-50,228,<500
My family and I went there last week Upon opening the doors we were greeted with the stench of SHIT It smelled so so bad even with wearing our face masks At one point it was so bad I started gagging Most of our party went outside and decided to not buy anything They had broken pipes This seems like it should be a health code violation for remaining open It cannot be good for the employees to breathing that in or the consumers purchasing food with shit particles are in the air Even though we were in there for only minutes our clothes and hair reeked I needed to wash my hair and clothes once home Shame on the owners for remaining open and not caring about their employees or consumers,negative,132,100-150,702,500-1000

Ice Cream was fine Server was the south end of a horse heading north Yeahno complaints about ice cream but guy serving was a complete jackass and made the experience bad enough that I am taking time to write this An apathetic server with bad looks and very dismissive attitude Really What kind of review would you expect We waited in line for quite a while and then when ordering I am not really sure why he decided to go negative on me Possibly because he was frustrated by previous customer but jeeznext time If I was the owner of this place I would probably address this issue Cold Stone looks like a better option across the street,negative,118,100-150,653,500-1000
There is not one bad thing to be said about Churn except that I wish I could get ice cream there every single day The staff is really bubbly and friendly the ice cream is to die for and if you dont get one of their ice cream sandwiches made with homemade ice cream AND homemade cookies youre completely insane,positive,60,50-75,317,<500

Disappointed Just had a red velvet cupcake and Ive actually had better from a grocery store bakery at home The cake was very bland and the abundant icing was just saccharin sweet with no flavor aside from pure sugar I grew up in NJ and hope that Carlos more traditional confections are better because this cupcake was an embarrassment to my heritage,negative,62,50-75,356,<500
This is my goto bakery when Im feeling a sugar craving or for any baked goods needed for events So many amazing choices and theyre all super delicious Im obsessed with their berry muffins  lemon bars,positive,37,25-50,207,<500

Stopped by Milk Bar after eating at Hattie Bs while at the cosmopolitan I had heard good reviews so I definitely had to give it a try Luckily it was Milk Bars birthday so they had a deal for the milk ice cream for 1 we added on the cereal which was a good decision The ice cream was soooo milky go figure and creamy and my husband said I feel like Im eating cereal and ice cream at the same time haha Which was true I think it was good to try but it wasnt the best ice cream Ive ever had however it wasnt bad Id give it a try if you stumble upon it,positive,117,100-150,573,500-1000
Went to check out this place over the weekend and I had the Maiko Speical The ice cream Macha  Vanilla and the sponge cake was good but the mochi and the agar jello are very bland The mochi was very doughy and the agar jello has no flavor Overall this place is a cool place to hang out with friends,positive,61,50-75,305,<500
im a fan of Cake Boss  with that being said i was excited to have pastry from Carlos I shouldnt have been Let me tell you about my experience The bakery is located across the way from the restraunt The restraunt isnt crowded the bakery however is crazy When youre facing the bakery to the left is an open viewing area of the pastry chefs hard at work Very nice touch especially because people always enjoy seeing exactly how their food is made and prepared However not a nice touch when the open viewing area is bigger than the dessert displays cash registers and eating area Because the dessert displays cash registers and eating area is cramped into such a small area damn that line is crazy We waited an hour in lineon a Sunday at 10 Come to find out due to genius staff or amazing managerthe open viewing area had 2 staff members both slowing filling pastries and the hectic crazy customer service side had 3 cashiersummm tell the manager that only one person needs to fill pastries Or even better use of time energy and effort is that after 10 stop filling pastries I mean the damn place closes at 11 and ur open how long during the day i think during the morning and afternoon u should b able to fill enough damn pastries Omg so frustrating i we were in line for an hour and we were really onlu 10 people deep into the line 10 people shouldve a walk in the partuh no it wasnt the pastry was goodbut it wasnt wait 1 hour good after waiting 1 hour i thought it would be amazing after this i realized i shouldnt expect much my husband said the following in reflection of his carlos bakery experience he said if u forget about the crazy prices the hour wait the cute red and white ribbon thats on the box and cake boss the tv show in general if u close ur eyes and take a bite of the cupcakesone word comes to mind Safeway as in Safeway supermarket he hit the nail right on the head,negative,361,300- 500,1960,1500-2000
While I like the name of the place our overall impression was pretty low First off on a Sat night they only had one person working in the shop She was busy giving out samplesmore on that latter dolling out ice cream and working the register We were unfortunetly stuck behind a large family that neeed to sample just about every flavor before placing an order I love the ability to sample a flavor before dropping 6 on a scoop of ice cream but litterly the sample size was barely there Unfortunetly it was enough to stop me from ordering the salted caramel I went with the Hazelnut which was disappoining as well We dropped about 30 for the four of us and my in laws another 10 for their order The consensus opinion is that we should have made the longer drive to Frost In addition to the limited selection slow service given the lack of staff the location is not the greatest with limited outdoor seating and even that would be facing the alley or parking lot,negative,179,150-200,983,500-1000
I really wanted to like this bakery but I just cant We actually went twice thinking the first time was just a one offbut no The french macrons were just awful One had a slight freezer burn wang and the other this weird texture The rainbow cookie had no taste whatsoever The cookies are scones not cookies and kind of bland The vibe is cool hip music and young people but i got the feeling theyre trying to be more of a cool bakery than a good bakery,negative,88,75-100,472,<500

I usually dont give reviews but this has definitely been a lousy experience Ice cream was mediocre and service is horrible I understand they have a lot of customers everytime i pass by But today happens to be one of those days wherein there was only two of us in line Employee was rude and impatient rushing me so i can finish my order This was my FIRST time its not like i can memorize the names of ice cream flavors available and the flavor options were located in the middle so had to keep on going back and forth to give ____ my order Seriously if you have issues pls dont bring it to work Really disappointed,negative,118,100-150,624,500-1000

I was excited to try this place from all the reviews and the magazine recommendation Another overrated place that I have tried out here in the phoenix area Ordered the strawberry ice cream cone and the specialty drink with the vietnamese coffee ice cream and expresso The strawberry ice cream was not even near the best Ive had like how the magazine suggested and the drink was WAY too bitter I wanted to toss the drink out the window,negative,79,75-100,439,<500

Why do we have to give a star As a longtime fan of the show my expectations were pretty high but sadly completely let down I had called earlier that day to see if they had the coffee crumb cake and if they could set it aside for me The girl said yes and when I arrived I was told they didnt have it and there was non in the shop I told them the situation and they said oh well So I called my family to see what else theyd want me to grab since they didnt save the coffee Cake The girl who was helping me had a lot of attitude with me after that and they began snickering with other workers whenever I would ask for something else and then they would say it was out My experience here was horrible mainly due to customer service and made me not want to even purchase the items then to top it off I got into the car and tried one of the cannolis Ive had better cannolis at lascaris So disappointed in the service and pastries,negative,188,150-200,943,500-1000

Ill be totally honest I started writing this review when I was at another bar and that review made VERY little sense Looking back on my experience at Milk Bar heres what I remember White Russian milkshake  In my original review I wrote that it had a lot of khalua not that Im complaining and its probably a better idea to share it if youve been drinking a lot that night It basically an alcoholic milkshake I also remember buying two cookies the compost cookie and cereal cookie The compost cookie was really flavorful There was a lot going on but it totally worked The cereal or cornflake cookie was also great Honestly the idea of cornflakes in cereal is a wonderful idea My only regret was not buying more and stashing it in my purse to bring back to LA,positive,142,100-150,779,500-1000

I never give 5 stars Stayed at the Venetian and this was the best thing there Had the pastry with caramelized onions topped with bacon and cream cheese this was to die for Tried 4 flavors of macarons vanilla coffee salted caramel and pistachios I have to say Ive tried a lot of macarons and this was by far the best Need to compare it to laduree Had to catch a flight leaving Vegas so I hauled ass from Cali to Vegas to try this place one more time Made the drive all worth it If this is a franchise someone please open up one in Texas See u soon Bouchon,positive,111,100-150,569,500-1000
Ive been going to this place since it opened and I can honestly say it is the best ice cream place I have ever been to The people are nice great atmosphere and the ice cream is delicious Whenever someone asks me for an ice cream place to go to 1010 times I recommend Melt,positive,55,50-75,279,<500
Really losing its touch Total fail today my husband just waited 40 mins for a bread pudding suppose to be 12 mins then it was burned BlackIm shocked they still brought it out The worst part is the nonchalant attitude when he took it to the front to complain Other stuff happened on this visit but this took the cake Disappointed,negative,61,50-75,344,<500

Great homemade tasting ice cream  a bunch of locations around the Cleveland area If you just want some honestly good ice cream  vanilla that tastes like vanilla honey pecan where the pecans are still crispy strawberry that takes like real strawberries  this is the place to go So hard to find naturally good ice cream  we wait all winter after downing overly processed and engineered ice cream for Honey Hut to open,positive,76,75-100,426,<500

One of two excellent ice cream experiences on our visit to AZ Hubby and I stopped in for a Toffee Banofi sundae Sooo yummy We picked Horchata and some other kind of ice cream I cant remember because they werent terribly flavorful but the rest of the sundae was fabulous The salted caramel sauce and brittle is yummy The best part The marshmallow I asked for That had to be the best marshmallow Ive ever had Creamy and perfectly caramelized and sticky from the torch Will definitely be back here next time I fly into Phoenix I tasted the honey bleu cheese ice cream and while hubby was not a fan I thought it was a unique and wonderful ice cream Only the ones we picked for the sundae were not that great I think they were just too subtle but at least they let the other ingredients shine,positive,149,100-150,809,500-1000
I was looking forward to getting what looked like delicious ice cream but couldnt even stand in line for more than a minute due to the very rude customer service of the staff Taury seemed to be the wannabe drill sergeant yelling at customers and berating them for the stupidest things in several occasions within the span of a few minutes I got it Im sure its tough dealing with tourists and customers in a servicebased industry all day thank you for your service but tact is still a useful tool that can be used if customers are unable to read your mind If I wanted this kind of experience I would have gone to Dicks Last Resort,negative,118,100-150,645,500-1000
This place is a building of cupcakes How can you not give it 5 stars They even sell shots of icing How is that not a thing everywhere else yet We were in Vegas for only 4 days and we came here twice I dont even remember the flavors we go All I remember was that the staff is friendly and helpful the store had a lot of pink and cheerful colors they had air conditioning and delicious morsels of yummy goodness dressed up as a cupcake Price is just right for the quality that you get Yum,positive,98,75-100,497,<500

Love the place and the flavors But homegirl serving the ice cream was RUUUUDE I asked to try a flavor and saidis this your most popular flavor and she replied we dont have a popular flavor My little brother even laughed in disbelief She really did not want to be helping people or chatting Hopefully she was just having a bad day and doesnt hate her job and treat everyone like that Cashier was sweet and friendly Ice cream was yum,positive,81,75-100,445,<500
My brothers and I had a great experience The place was really inviting and the woman working there was super kind and cheerful She gave us some matcha and green tea soft serve cream to try and it was so yummy They were smooth and really flavorful The quality was amazing I didnt know how much better these things could taste until today Together the 3 of us shared the Maiko special and the matcha cream 1010 man ,positive,79,75-100,427,<500

I am not impressed and quite frankly I think their baguettes are overpriced and overrated For local standards their bread is better than the horrors of American storebought bread I bought two baguette loaves at Willy Street Coop on Thursday evening By Friday morning the baguettes were hard This tells me that the bread was either already a day old when I bought it or they dont know what they are doing I spent three years in Germany and toured around Europe Fresh baguettes do not behave like this Batch Backhouse cannot match Madison Sourdough or Clausens The Baguette had large holes it didnt really taste like anything I would think it hadnt been given enough time to rest and develop flavor through longer fermentation or like they hadnt started with a great yeast starter Dont forget to bring lots of cash These people will rob you blind and will not pay their suppliers a fair price for their inputs The product at Willy Street cost 275 per loaf The Batch Store charges 375 per loaf Madison Sourdough is 350 per loaf and it looks larger It is also sourdough which is much better than what Batch offered The girl at Batch said they only use the finest ingredients produced by Norwegian bachelor farmers I asked her what the farmers got for a bushel of wheat and she didnt know and I told her I thought Batch was making very rich profits I asked her if she knew the cost to make a loaf vs the sales price She didnt know the cost to produce a loaf In conclusion The Baguettes of Batch are not good at all  Suggest one buys their breads at Madison Sourdough  Much much better product at a cheaper price I will not buy Batch products again,negative,303,300- 500,1692,1500-2000
This place was difficult to find GPS was a monster and had us walking around for about an hour We used both an iPhone and a Samsung to map this and it was super confusing on both and no one who worked at the hotels seemed to know where it was These pastries were expensive When we got back to our room it was clear they had not been refrigerated which is fine for cookies but I am fairly certain that buttercream should be refrigerated The cake tasted ok but not great I put my cake in the rooms fridge and ate it the next day It tasted better cold but there was still the issue of it not being refrigerated in the first place The cake was fairly bland I got the rainbow cake and felt like it could have had more flavor But it tasted like basic white cake and food coloring For the amount of time it took us to find this place and for around 8 for one slice it should have tasted more exciting I bought my son a cookie sugar cookie with sprinkles It was 3 Which was the least expensive thing there But Ive purchased the same type of cookie at a Mexican bakery for 50 super I wasnt thrilled about spending so much money on a childs cookie but prices werent clearly visible and there is pressure to order quickly My friend ordered a cup of milk She got about 8 oz or milk They charged her about 3 Which is more than the price for a gallon of milk They also gave her milk that was sitting on the counter God only knows how long it was unrefrigerated the last bit from the jug and mixed it with a new jug of milk This probably only creeps me out to mix milk but I thought I would add it since I am on a roll As someone who worked in food service for years I think many of their non refrigeration practices are kinda gross and a potential health hazard I wasnt impressed with this place at all,negative,357,300- 500,1834,1500-2000
Im not quite understanding the hype I got the cereal milk shake and it was very off It was really salty and didnt had any sweetness to it at all The ice cream part just tasted like as if I threw milk in the freezer and made it into ice cream Then I added corn flakes and blended it all up It really wasnt anything special The price is ridiculous as well I got a regular size which turned out to be 10 for a 12oz cup Considering the how much I disliked the product and price I dont think they deserve more than 1 star I might come back once more to try their soft serve and update my review if that goes well,negative,125,100-150,625,500-1000

I pulled in the lot at 1055 PM on Saturday night on the first of august my sons birthday to get some treats for me and my family When I went to the doors a bit later they were already locked I checked my watch to make sure and it was 1057 PM This is NOT OKAY WHEN IT IS NOT THE CLOSING TIME THAT IS ADVERTISED We drove by the drive thru and it was closed as well While driving by the car at the window we heard in the background We arent doing that 1102 shit anymore This is very unprofessional to hear at what is supposed to be a family friendly establishment This was the last straw for me and I will not be coming back because of the issues I had experienced,negative,136,100-150,681,500-1000
I was very disappointed with this bakery Im a native of Las Vegas and rarely venture to the Strip I first came upon the smaller of the bakeries and was told the main one was 1 floor below First off they werent as friendly as the lady in the smaller bakery I didnt find any plain almond croissants only ones with a chocolate drizzle When i inquired for plain ones was curtly told he was sold out so i asked for the ones with a drizzle I next asked if i could customize the box of macarons was told no So i said id just get 4 pieces of macarons When i get to the cashier i was told my bill was 28 I wasnt thinking and just handed my card over They never said thank you Walking to the Palazzo i realized it seemed too pricey i opened my bag and realized that they put a box of macarons which i never ordered I normally wont mind this but i was very disappointed and displeased with their service I got home and tried their almond croissant with drizzle and was not impressed The pastry was not as flaky and a bit on the hard side The macarons are not as swoonworthy as i expected them to be maybe the horrible customer service left a bad taste in my mouth I would rather bring my business to Patisserie Manon and support local business,negative,243,200-250,1266,1000-1500
We got the strawberry cream square 320 coconut twist pastry 205 and the bag of 3 chocolate chip cookies 330 The strawberry cream square was just ok but its expensive for such a small square of cake The coconut twist pastry was just ok too better can be found at Sunville Bakery I had the biggest complaint with the chocolate chip cookies which was horrible with the large cinnamon flavor in the cookies The cookies didnt have any buttery flavor with the chocolate chips and the cookies were hard and crispy where I prefer crispy outside and chewy inside,negative,99,75-100,577,500-1000
Handels ice cream is great We love all the flavors we have tried and frequently go back for more I gave this business a 1star review today because the employee serving ice cream and taking payments was NOT WEARING A MASK This is unacceptable and we along with other customers in line walked away without getting ice cream Not sure if I will be back to this business which does not seem to be taking the necessary covid precautions I do love their ice cream but Ill just go to the store instead where the employees and customers are wearing masks,negative,101,100-150,557,500-1000
I keep hearing things about Bouchon this and Bouchon that There wasnt any money in the budget to eat at the actual Bouchon so the bakery was the closest I could get to it Loren John B said they have the best doughnuts in America according to Yahoo so we ventured out to the Venetain to check it out They are located by the Phantom theatre Sadly by the time we got there they were all sold out This was at 11am We opted for a TKO their version of an oversized oreo red velvet and chocolate cupcakes I really liked the TKO the filing was really good As for the cupcakes here NO The red velvet tasted nothing like red velvet and they put regular ol cream cheese in the middle of the cupcake The chocolate one was okay I really want to know what the doughnuts taste like Doughnut get the cupcakes,negative,154,150-200,816,500-1000

I was so excited when I found out cake boss is in the same hotel that I was staying at omg However it was definitely a walk to find this place though Im sure there were quicker ways but oh well The store is a lot smaller than I expected Love how you can see behind the scene with the glass windows We came at a good time because after we ordered the line literally multiplied by 20 The ordering process was quick however I did not like the paying process Other people in lines were complaining as well So we stayed in line waiting to order then after we ordered we went in another line waiting to pay WHAT I felt like that literally just made the store more crowded and its just so unesscessary We got the lobster tails cream puff chocolate mouse cream puff and a chocolate cannoli I loved how crispy the lobster tails were however it was just TOO creamy in the inside for me My boyfriend felt the same way Everything was delicious but in our opinions it was just way too sweet to our liking Ill def come back when Im in town but this time just one lobster tail,positive,207,200-250,1086,1000-1500
I really dont know where to begin with this review but Ill keep it short and sweet This review is not based on anything other than the sorry excuse for customer I received Lets start from the beginning my friend and I were in our hotel room decided to call sprinkles since it was 1140pm and they close at midnight We inquired about delivery she explained it to us and she was extremely friendly The girl over the phone said just come down before we close Okay cool being that we were staying at the linq which isnt that far at all we high tail to it sprinkles We get there around 1155 the girl at the door lets my friend in but when I approach she blocks the door So I move to the left she moves with me again blocking the door so I move to the right again she moves with me blocking the door So I step back and she says were closed Excuse me Its not midnight but you let my friend in meanwhile I have to stand outside and wait Are you kidding me Horrible first you block me from getting in when she could have said in the first place we are closed I will be calling the corporate office it is completely unprofessional to do what she did and Ill never visit another sprinkles again Shame on you,negative,236,200-250,1225,1000-1500

I love love love chocolate and when I visited Ghirardelli it was like a chocolate heaven When I walked in I saw several lines of different flavors of chocolate and caramels aligned on the walls There was a cute area for the seating and an area for the ice cream making My friends and I ordered cocoa floats A cocoa float is a cup filled completely with vanilla bean ice cream with chilled hot chocolate poured over the top DELICIOUS I wish I had taken a picture but it was too good that I completely forgot Overall Ghirardelli was a success And I will definitely be coming back for more,positive,110,100-150,600,500-1000

5 stars all around This place has been bookmarked for some time now and Im so glad I finally got the chance to try this awesome place out One spontaneous night My friend and I were craving for something sweet We were all the way in the West valley but said hey why not take a drive for some what could be awesome ice cream And guess what the drive was worth it and the ice cream was definitely worth it There was two people in front of us trying out different flavors As we waited the guy at the cash register greeted us and welcomed us He also recommended a few things and made suggestions We looked at the menu and anticipated the taste trials Our turn was up and we werent rushed at all and were even recommended to try as many flavors as we wished Brandon The owner behind the counter was very nice I finally decided on the indecision 5 scoops of ice cream with a topping of choice It was so hard for me to choose and Brandon even made it harder but also so kind to let me choose a topping of choice AND a syrup drizzle of choice It was a hard decision but I finally went with chocolate strawberry butter pecan bourbon caramel toffee and Cookie Monster Cookie Monster was my most fave My friend went with the dough melt with the fat Elvis ice cream as her choice and she highly enjoyed it also Were both excited to come back real real soon,positive,262,250-300,1378,1000-1500
This is my first time to leave a negative 1 star review the cashier lady with short hair and eyeglasses provided the worst customer service ever When I picked 8 small items with 2 cheese cakes and asked for a little box so I can give it to my friend as a gift She was super rude and said she couldnt give me a box without choosing 9 small pieces of pastries Well I said I picked 10 items including the cheesecake and she still said no cheesecakes are not counted as small items she said the only way I can have a box is get one more small item I am very upset and ask for speaking with a manager and she said she is the manager At the end I didnt want to argue with her anymore so I bought one more small item to get this precious box The boss let this kind of person to manage the store I see why there are so much unsatisfactory below the comment section Very RUDE manager with NO customer service didnt show any empathy to any customers The worst experience in Vegas never come back,negative,196,150-200,1006,1000-1500
We stopped here for our sweet treat after dinner before heading back to our hotel and the place was BUMPIN There was already a line snaking around the building by the time we parked and we waited about twice as long here as at Primanti Brothers No worries though it moved quickly enough and everyone was in a pleasant mood Our kiddo got birthday cake in a cup with mini MMs one of us got a pistachio cone with rainbow sprinkles and the other got their celebrated chocolate chip sundae The ice cream here is delicious super thick and creamy and the perfect soft serve consistency The pistachio had a bit of a chemical aftertaste but thats how it sometimes goes with that flavor at these sorts of joints The sundae was a bit too overwhelming for us but it was good Prices are fair Pages is a charming and obviously popular spot and what we liked most about it was that it seemed to attract characters from all walks of life which is kind of rare to witness these days Everyone was just wanting a frozen treat on a hot Memorial Day and it was kind of nice to be reminded that Americans of different races and classes can all enjoy the same thing without any vitriol Wed definitely recommend this joint and might even come back later this week,positive,231,200-250,1266,1000-1500
They technically close at 10pm today It is currently 730 now The picture is no exaggeration I asked if they are still baking some pastries to make this visit worth it  we will wait Unfortunately they are not refilling the shelves anymore Not sure if the opening last friday was a soft opening but this is just very disappointing They hyped this place soo much and they should have prepared even better,negative,73,50-75,413,<500

No Never again I stopped in last week to pick up a few things but mainly some chocolate jalapeÃos as a gift for a friend The shop had a decent variety of things to choose from but nothing overly impressive I gifted the jalapeÃos to a friend and she ate one immediately and said it tasted good That evening she sent me a photo of the other jalapeÃo with the chocolate pulled off and it was covered in MOLD I emailed the shop and Abby from their marketing department was quick to reply but said that even though the jalapeÃos are prepared fresh daily some things are out of their control In my experience if it was prepared fresh daily mold would not have had a chance to grow Abby did refund my money minus the tip I left but this is just too gross not to share,negative,148,100-150,780,500-1000

Somewhat of a shitshow location run by teenagers with half assed customer service and management I dont get the rave reviews considering this is an overhyped Baskin Robins and only tried out as I live in the Southwest Yes they have tons of flavors but with nothing special about the quality at all as I beyond expected compared to ice cream from the grocery store So many better ice cream shops on Rainbow alone from Gelatology and Asia Creamery where there are so many unique delicious flavors tropical or savory among the quality being much more fresh and not sickly sweet Complete pass for me here as nothing stands out aside from the complete lack of managment and a well run environment Sticking to my staples from now on,negative,129,100-150,734,500-1000
JUST DONT weve been coming here since they opened They raised their price twice in past 12 months That would be ok if it was the best cupcake ever but its not Place was filthy counter had more than one cupcake smeared on the counter The tables outside were all dirty every table When we went first went here they were like Disney The people made it nice and welcoming and just seemed like a really special place Thats all gone its dirty and the people seem overworked and uncaring Sorry to say because it was good pre mouse in the sprinkles window  on YouTube btw,negative,107,100-150,584,500-1000
SOOO WONDERFUL I am a nursing student so late night cafes with delicious coffee and even better sugary confections are exactly what I need The atmosphere is really eclectic and homey and I can spend hours there just getting my work done Made a few study buddy friends and although it can get PACKED in a hurry the people are really great about sharing space If you havent been there YOU MUST GO,positive,73,50-75,402,<500

Daughter wanted a brownie sundae 17 Lyft ride here yesterday Sunday and they were out of browniesreally Young man behind the counter could have cared less and did nothing to ease her disappointment and my irritation besides saying we can substitute with cookies No apology no attempt to make us happy just shrugged his shoulders and looked annoyed that we were annoyed What a waste of time and money,negative,69,50-75,420,<500
Lemon custard how I love you  its you that I adore I know Jarlings offers lots of flavors but I cant try any more All cities should understand custard and the difference between custard and ice cream The world would be a kinder gentler place,positive,46,25-50,251,<500

I was always eying this shop every time I went to the cosmopolitan to eat but I really dont know what I was thinking I hate the taste of cereal milk 75 of the menu cannot really be enjoyed to its full potential for me because of my wheat allergy And it was all so overpriced I assumed it would taste good but the reviews were not bad and the store had visual appeal I ordered a regular coffee shake without the alcohol because actually wanted a pick me up before we left Vegas But I couldnt even finish I mean if cereal milk is your jam go for it But if you are like me you never even bother to drink the milk as a kid after eating your Caps crunch or Lucky Charms youre not going to like where this is going It is completely down to personal preference but I cant say that I understand the hype at all,negative,162,150-200,827,500-1000
It tasted like rotten dairy and the staff was very very rude I could not believe it because I was very excited to try Super disappointing,negative,26,25-50,141,<500
Sprinkles never disappoints We spotted it from a distance due to their double dot Vegasstyle jazzed up sign If youre a frequent flyer you know what Im talking about Anyway there is a separate line for the cupcakes and for the ice cream  which was great because we wanted the latter and got our ice cream right away while there was a long cupcake line on the other side They do both Sprinkles regular sized as well as minisundaes which we love Theyre great portion control as well Service was friendly and fast Ice cream and mini cupcake were great as usual Theres some seating right outside  and if thats too crowded theres a fountain close by to sit along which is what we ended up doing Definitely recommend,positive,131,100-150,736,500-1000
Finally I had a chance to visit the Venetian Since I was there I wanted to try a macaron at the popular Bouchon Bakery I went to the smaller cafe version on street level on the strip since I was very close I had already decided on which pricey macaron to get but no one still came to help me I looked to my left and saw some of their young help in the back just chatting away They looked at me but didnt budge I guess their conversation was much more important I just left without anything,negative,98,75-100,501,500-1000
Avoid this vile place at all costs and itll cost you a lot Cookies are bagged in cellophane and just look at all the nasty ingredients on the label The soft serve ice cream has no taste I tried a twist and could not distinguish one flavour from the other This place is a perfect example of why the Cosmopolitan should not rely so heavily on celebrity chefs And this one should be ashamed of herself Judging by the lineups its a money maker but dont waste yours,negative,88,75-100,478,<500

Anything you put in your mouth here will be delicious Ive been coming here since it first opened 5 years ago and it is always perfection The only thing keeping me from rating it 5 stars is that it is now so overrun with people that the ambiance that Amelies once had no longer exists Get the petit gateaux vanilla strawberry mini cake thing,positive,64,50-75,346,<500
Amazing Ice cream I tried the dough melt which was overwhelming and I couldnt finish the entire doughnut The Cookie Monster ice cream flavor was delicious It goes well with captain crunch topping The cookie monster ice cream does turn you mouth blue however I dont think I will try the dough melt next time just because how heavy it turned out to be But ice cream was great Service was good too The catchier explained everything about the menu and ice cream pretty well and answered all our questions It was quick too,positive,94,75-100,529,500-1000
I first heard of Carlos Bake Shop from browsing around YouTube and discovering TLCs series Cake Boss After finding out that they had a location in Vegas and I was heading out to Vegas in a few weeks I was looking forward to trying out their TVfeatured pastries I had high hopes just like every viewer and expected to be bedazzled I mean this guy can make the most outrageously extravagant cakes ever I expected the best of the best but was left feeling kind of disappointed Pros Conveniently located inside The Venetian Hotel Also right across from his restaurant Buddy Vs Ristorante which is also average All their desserts are not too sweet The red velvet cake which can be too sweet sometimes wasnt too sweet at all The cannoli and the napoleon cake is pretty good They provide free paper plates knives and forks if you ask Desserts are simple and plain but pretty GOOD Cons The wait Prepare to wait for an hour Since its a tourist attraction they have a long line that expands way past the store The service The reason why the wait is so long even though they serve everything ALREADY made is because the servers work at a very slow and calm pace Im from a big city so Im use to quick service but they REALLY take their time here and the wait is already long enough  Also once you order your pastries you wait in a separate line to pay And there is only ONE cashier Since Carlos is such a popular spot I wonder why they wont hire more workers and have more cash registers The buttercream filling They use the same filling for their cream puffs and eclairs Maybe if they used a different filling to complement each pastry it would be more unique I didnt really like it It tasted mostly like butter Nothing rich flavorful or unique Didnt see the crazy cakes on the show I saw some nice cakes that they hang on the wall but nothing too crazy You dont actually see them making the desserts in the window They bake in the kitchen which you cant see The window where you do see them theyre simply transferring desserts around Nothing exciting The qualitytaste of the desserts Solid good desserts overall But not unique or memorable Some are very plain Ill still come back since I want to try the famous lobster tail but the ridiculously long wait and slow service also makes me want to avoid this place like the plague ,positive,430,300- 500,2419,2000+
AmÃlie AmÃlie AmÃlie AmÃlie AmÃlie singing in Lil Waynes voice to the beat of Amilli hope you know it WOW Three letters that describe our having a hard time deciding what to get grabbingaboxofpastriestogo and eating them experience at AmÃlies This was one of our bookmarks during our trip to Charlotte for my birthday but it was one of those We may not make it it wasnt high on our priorities kind of thing That would have been the BIGGEST mistake I have seriously found the best French bakery I have EVER been to There are a few in the area this is their NoDa location Inside  very shabby chic and eclectic Colorful walls old furniture chandeliers fun paintings and pictures cool knickknacks They serve everything from breakfast sandwiches tartines open faced sandwiches salads seasonal beverages and of course variations and tons of options for coffee and of course EVERY pastry imaginable The hardest part  deciding what to get We went with  2 macarons  Orange CrÃme and a Nutella one a pecan tart a lemon tart a Chocolate croissant two Palmiers elephant ears and a Cinnamon twist Every single pastry was pure perfection Crispy when it needed to be fluffy moist delicate and ohsoflavorful The box did not make it back to Virginia Beach We tried maybe if we got more some would have but these didnt stand a chance It was a 5 hour drive after all The BEST part besides how amazing these pastries are This place is open 247 YES 247 What the Great and efficient service you order they box it and you pay everyone was nice the line was smooth and moved quickly and you get amazing goodies for great prices Whats not to love about AmÃlie When we return to Charlotte one day this is definitely high on the priority of places we must return to Ketoschmeto Highly recommend Review 50 of 2019,positive,323,300- 500,1910,1500-2000
Disappointed is my word for this location I have visited the Fort Lauderdale location twice and have walked away raving about the food When I saw that Las Vegas had a shop I was giddy We took our who was a first timer into the shop as well and told her about all the yummy options I didnt want too much so I ordered 2 scoops of Cookie Monster with hot fudge The server seemed to not understand my order but finally got it straight It wasnt bad For 899 it should be amazing right My friend ordered a chocolate milkshake Again a different server seemed to be lost on what to do In the times of today where lots of places are short on help I wasnt surprised She also asked for whipped cream which is an added charge This shake took 5 minutes to make Not sure why And her whipped cream wasnt on it She said something about it didnt taste right We couldnt figure out what My husband ordered the cookies with ice cream Its our most favorite thing He was extremely disappointed The cookies were really hard and didnt taste fresh The store was busy but the employees seemed off There wasnt a lot of communication and the whole visit was just not what we had hoped It felt messy in there I would return to the FL location again but not this one,negative,239,200-250,1281,1000-1500
I would have never known about this place had my girlfriend not lived near Charlotte for a year She used to hang out here all the time and when we passed through Charlotte on the way home from vacation she had to go back for a visit This is one of the coolest bakeries Ive ever seen It consists of a maze of different rooms each different from the last as well as a side patio and back patio thats tucked away behind the building If I were the hangoutinacoffeeshopbakeryanddowork kind of type and lived in Charlotte Id be here all the time too On top of the awesome layout they offer some high quality French pastries and treats and Im always down for those Unfortunately they were out of Napoleons my goto so I went with the layered chocolate torte and salted caramel brownie Both were excellent We were here on Easter Sunday and it seemed pretty busy but I dont really have anything to compare it to I would have taken pictures but theres already over 400 posted so I assumed I would be duplicating others efforts I may not be the coffee house type but I do love sweets and can appreciate an awesome bakery and thats what Amelies is So if youre staying in Charlotte or just passing through maybe on your way to or from Ohio its definitely a sight to see,positive,237,200-250,1308,1000-1500
Fresh donuts and variety the best donuts around I recommend this place The apple fritters are the best around,positive,19,<50,113,<500
I love 85 degree bakery however this location is at a very unfortunate spot  in the midst of a shopping center that is mostly restaurants with too little parking The last 2 times we came there was no parking spot to be found even after 20 minutes of slow circling with 10 other cars We ended up leaving empty handedif you want to purchase something do not come between 111 or after 5 Wish they had spots for 15 min parking only for shoppers or were in a center that had more parking ie across the street,negative,98,75-100,515,500-1000
Im not even big on ice cream I love frozen yogurt and sobert When Jenis first opened the line was down the block every night I go during lunch time so I can have time to try and few flavors before committing They have new flavors that come out for the season Best ice cream I have ever had,positive,59,50-75,298,<500
While I am glad I can say Ive tried Sprinkles Cupcakes Im disappointed because I wouldnt recommend them to anyone If I wanted a dry tasteless cupcake Id go to a grocery store CUPCAKES Black  White and Peanut Butter Banana TASTETEXTURE Given the hype about Sprinkles we expected moist delicious cupcakes What we got instead were driedout cupcakes that appeared to have been sitting out for way to long The frosting on the Peanut Butter Banana had the consistency of gritty toothpaste and tasted like cheap peanut butter The Black  White cupcake was okay but still not worth the 399 for a single cupcake DECOR Clearly the put their money into decorating the shop to make it as appealing as possible while ignoring their cupcakes SERVICE The women behind the counter were both very friendly and attentive,negative,139,100-150,829,500-1000
Came here to find gluten free options since it shows as having them on Yelp but they had none It would be helpful if they would remove that descriptor from their business,negative,32,25-50,173,<500
I was a bit disappointed I love the show and been waiting to travel to New Jersey to visit this place I order the Lobster Tails and Crumb Cake Either didnt actually move mountains for me For the price I paid for 2 lobster tails and 1 crumb cake 20bucks seem to be very expensive and I was surprised at the flavordidnt seem fresha total disappointment The ticket system they have seems to help keep the massive crowd controlled but I have to say the wait time to order is a bit long Hopefully things are better at the actual venue in New Jersey Gonna give them one more chance Still love the tv show though,negative,116,100-150,625,500-1000

The place was disorganized As I was waiting to place my order I noticed a fly inside the food case It landed on a cupcake The staff couldnt care about placing an order Once I finally got my order the cupcake was dry It appeared to be a day old Im not going here again and I dont recommend it,negative,60,50-75,303,<500
I was excited by the photos and so glad to see a new bakery choice in Champaign Ive tried several of the smaller items from the case to taste test for larger occasions I have to say  Im not particularly impressed It pains me to say that because I really tried The most lasting impression was a small cheesecake I tried a few weeks ago The batch was so underdone that the bottom was soupy which in turn made the crust and the cake inedible When I went back a few days later I mentioned it while pursuing the case to try something new The woman behind the counter said she knew the batch was underdone But no refund offer replacement or even an apology Just an We know I left with a bottle of wine and some cheese instead There are other places to go for bakery items so maybe Ill try again after theyve been settled for awhile,negative,161,150-200,851,500-1000
Not what we expected from an Italian bakery Cold bread for sandwiches because they have no toasters Chicken salad was inedible clearly not made that morning Plus a server with a real attitude with yes  no clipped responses to any questions He clearly didnt want to be there and in retrospect neither did we,negative,55,50-75,318,<500
This was the first time my boyfriend and I tried this We have lived in Pittsburgh our whole lives and have heard good reviews The menu had plenty of options and looked awesome I was torn between the chocolate chip sundae and the chocolate dip cone I decided to get the dip cone but they said they had no chocolate left This was at 7pm I then asked for the sundae and they also had no chocolate chip cookies left Whaaat Ugh So I got a regular vanilla brownie sundae The sundae was mostly vanilla and had one small brownie and very little chocolate syrup I asked to add cherries which tasted different to me as well I can sadly say I was disappointed in my Visit here and am truly not a picky eater I wish they had possibly put a sign on the window that they were out of these ingredients before people ordered My boyfriend did say he enjoyed his dirt sundae though I dont think I will be returning unfortunately,negative,174,150-200,928,500-1000

Very pretty decor and perfect to sit and sip with a book Butter cream was so delish Cute presentation when served to eat in Not much variety and thats the reason for 4stars not 5 Parking lot adjacent but pay at kiosk and only 1hr So worth it,positive,48,25-50,249,<500
Updateservice is a bit better than before compared to a year ago however the wait time is still on the longer side As for taste it is still on the lower quality Their milk teas and bubble teas are still powder based which doesnt surprise me as it is part of a chain However it blows my mind that something as simple as milk tea requires powder packets for the sake of convenience As for their coffees Id love to see the beans treated with the respect they deserve Theres much more than just sticking a label on it from Ethiopia or Fair Trade Overall its not somewhere I would choose to go to,negative,114,100-150,614,500-1000
So good and worth the drive from the West Valley great little patio to set and enjoy the evening and the incredible ice cream This is a most if you like a great little shop and great ice cream,positive,39,25-50,195,<500
Went there for an inexpensive afternoon snack Outside seating is nice  although it is right by a bus stop and the main street Previous reviews indicated that it was a little gem within expensive restaurants I couldnt disagree more The ham and cheese baguette I had was probably one of the worst I have ever had It was old dry and rubberychewy They did however offer to toast my bitten into sandwich Bouchon quality for me means freshly made to order sandwiches and not premade old ones from the morning Very disappointed,negative,93,75-100,534,500-1000
I was very disappointed by the cookies here It tasted like it was frozen and then reheated They were extremely expensive 450495 each and not that good Ive definitely had better and will not be back,negative,36,25-50,207,<500

Very bad experience here The store does not even reach its capacity it was barely half of its Unfortunately they let people wait outside for nothing in the cold rain A prudent people will let the same numbers of people in vs out unfortunately the young lady guarding at the door didnt know how to handle the situation We asked her why She simply answered she was afraid of long lines but looked in the picture  This is not even defined as a regular long  line that you should imagine My gosh Sorry Even in bigger city things like that Never happened with other 85 locations which are even smaller in square feet This store manager better know how to prepare for holiday seasons,negative,126,100-150,695,500-1000
I completely forgot how awesome Batch was until a recent trip back to Madison I was pleased that they finally relocated to the bigger storefront which to me meant that theyd likely have more goodies to offer I was not disappointed Ive had numerous great items in the past from Batch from their baguettes to the popular monkey bread One of my favorite pastries since I was a kid was the morning bun I was like a little kid in a candy store when I saw that Batch had one of their own on my recent stop As what Corey D woul say son of a batch This big buttery ball of goodness topped with gooey caramel may have been one of the best morning buns I had ever eatenbelieve me Ive eaten many This one may actually rival Simmas in Milwaukee This alone would warrant 10 stars but damn Yelp only allows five I need to try one of their savory offerings and a loaf of challah the next time Im in town,positive,174,150-200,921,500-1000

everything here is yummy at least the sweets the tarts were awesome chocolate lemon and so were the croissants chocolate eclair cookies chocolate mousse cake and on and on Some of the desserts are the same simplified from the restaurant so if you want to save a couple of bucks get them here its not to be missed,positive,58,50-75,332,<500
Fresh pastries and baked goods delicious A French bistro feel to the place Sometimes feels a little more hipsterish than I am but who cares the eatables are delicious My one complaint if it can be called that is that too much of their seating is large tables for 810 that too often have on person using the table as an office  which makes seating a bit scarce There is overflow seating out in the mall behind but it is not really a pleasant place to sit out there I wish theyd ditch the big tables and replace them with several small tables that could be pushed together if you come with a crowd But what the Heck you can always get your bread or pastries to go  and they are delicious,positive,134,100-150,712,500-1000
This location is nothing like the Irvine California location My wife and I were given incorrect information by another employee and when we spoke to Nanz the leadmanager on duty about that issue she had zero customer service skills Very short in tone and unprofessional My recommendation is that corporate revisits training at the LV location if they expect to have repeat customers,negative,63,50-75,387,<500
This place is hard to find but super delicious Just look for the Phantom Theater and its tucked under the stairsescalator My family and I did halvsies with sandwiches a pecan tart and a bread pudding The sandwiches were very reminiscent of those from Europe with quality ingredientsgreat crusty bread meats and cheeses I was very pleased that though the sandwich had been sitting in the case for a bit it wasnt soggy at all The real stars were the desserts The crust on the pecan tart was so thin and buttery and delicate that the honey and I are going back to the Bouchon Bakery in Yountville this weekend to relive the experience The bread pudding was also super delicious it was the right balance of wet and dry and was wonderfully flavored Amazing This is a mustvisit little stand in Vegas,positive,143,100-150,821,500-1000
The food is unbelievable whether its a sandwich a box full of desserts or a cheese tray My personal favorite are the mini crÃme brulees they have seasonal flavors I love visiting Amelies in the middle of the night to people watch there is such a huge range of people who visit you never know who you might see,positive,59,50-75,319,<500
This place is a must try for their fresh homemade marshmellows they are softer than the store bought ones The ice cream taste more when it comes to your regular chocolate and vanilla bean but I wish they would have more exotic flavors here maybe something to consider,positive,48,25-50,271,<500
The people who work here are so kind and friendly I think thats what keeps people coming back for ice cream in the middle of nowhere where parking sucks and the sun beats down on your back when waiting in line It get so hot that they have a cover for the handle and a pad to push the door Theyre known for the dough melt which is an ice cream scoop in a warm donut bun This comes with a free topping all for 525 They also have the Leslie Knope which I wanted to try because Parks  Rec was such a fun show but I picked the dough melt over it The dough melt was delicious I didnt think the donut was too sweet by itself It was fluffy and chewy at the same time They let you sample flavors Vanilla and chocolate were their award winning flavors I ended up sharing a 5 root beer float with the vanilla ice cream Other flavors I thought tasted pretty good were caramel toffee crunch lemon raspberry sorbet and Cookie Monster My experience with Cookie Monster is from Afters in Orange County CA the ice cream is uber sweet and doesnt really stain your mouth blue The Cookie Monster ice cream here is not sweet its actually a bit thick but it has multiple toppings in it like Oreo and brownies It will stain your tongue blue When I asked for Oreo topping the server said it was the rightest choice You can come here knowing there is a bit of a wait but the service here is unlike that of any other business,positive,275,250-300,1447,1000-1500

4 star average Are you nuts I had to pick up my mom from the airport and had to hang around Phoenix for a bit before her flight I was craving some ice cream so I decided to stop by here It had good Yelp reviews and was near where I was at Umkind of wish I had gone somewhere else I walked up to the converted house and there were about 5 people in front of me This place is TINY You can only fit about 3 people comfortably in the place There is only one guy working in the joint so it took a little bit to serve the other people While waiting I noticed that some of the ice cream looked a little melted and not normal The lady in front of me tried to order a scoop of pistachio and the guy let her know that it wasnt available He took a spoon and showed her how he couldnt scoop it out Turns out that the heater not sure if it was the heater in the place or the heater in the ice cream cooler was permanently on and they couldnt turn it off WTF is that Truly lived up to the Melt name Anywaysplaced my order for one scoop of Nutter Butter one scoop Little Debbie and one scoop Cookie Wasted Paid the man my 625 he scooped my ice cream to his credit he did hook me up with pretty large scoops into a Chinese takeout container added a fortune cookie on top and I was on my way Here is how it was flavor by flavor Nutter Butter Tasted like the peanut butter cookies The ice cream was really really soft though due to the heater issue and a bit icy Not sure if it could have been better more hard or what but I was not that impressed It tasted and reminded me of the ice cream I can make at home in my Cuisinart mixer Decent but not great Little Debbie Umcouldnt differentiate the taste of this and the Nutter Butter really Peanuty ish like those little wafer bars but same texture and taste The mix ins were skimp too Cookie Wasted Vanilla base with oreos and chips ahoy cookies Once again soft icy and the mix ins were skimp This flavor was the best of the bunch but even then it was just average First impressions are very important I was not impressed at all with the quality of ice cream I can make stuff at home that is better than this The shop is too small the ice cream too expensive and the ambiance is a little too hipster for my liking I dont think I will ever return Ice cream is like pizzaits never really bad but this is definitely 2 star worthy and there are plenty other good ice cream shops located in Phoenix Meh,negative,488,300- 500,2535,2000+

This was my first time trying SomiSomi as this new location opened up right by my house Its amazing The taiyaki was so good We tried the cheddar and custard and both were amazing The ahboong was also one of the best desserts Ive ever had The taiyaki waffle is so flaky on the outside but doughy and soft inside It goes so well with the ice cream I cant wait to go back,positive,74,50-75,384,<500
I bought two cupcakes I got strawberry strawberry and a red velvet Im not 100 satisfied or I guess my expectations were really high I had seen these cupcakes all over social media and I wanted to try it out since Im here in Las Vegas Both cupcakes have a huge amount of frosting that is so thick The strawberry cupcake does not taste like strawberry at all Kinda more like a carrot cake The red velvet is pretty good except I dont like the frosting again its really thick and doesnt go well together,negative,95,75-100,514,500-1000

Nothing like a French bakery they cut a croissant and put ham in it like a sandwich Very disappointed for how highly everyone talks about Thomas keller restaurants It Must get good reviews here because its vegas and there are so many people and so many options It mightve better than Starbucks but not by much Its generic baked goods and mediocre coffee for people in a hurry,negative,68,50-75,384,<500

My boss had been raving about this place for months so we had to try it We are not vegan heck we arent even vegetarians but wanted to try something new The donuts were delicious We tried the glazed twist blueberry cake and apple cider The store opens at 9am on weekends but we didnt get there until after 11am so most of their selection was sold out My daughter 11 LOVED her twist donut having no idea that it wasnt a regular donut The blueberry cake donut was sweet while not being over whelming The donuts themselves were very light and not dense or heavy I was very pleasantly surprised Definitely will be back to try the tiramisu and oatmeal cookie dough the flavors change monthly so we will have to go sooner than later,positive,136,100-150,747,500-1000
I am sorry to say it but I was underwhelmed I saw the story of the advent of Milk Bar on Netflix and was truly inspired and couldnt wait to indulge in Milk Bars treats I had the cereal milk soft serve and it was just soso needed some sweetness Also had the crack pie which was tasty but nothing more than a gooey butter cake which I am very familiar with Also had the composite cookie which was also good however having a warmfresh out the oven rendition would be far more impactful to my taste buds All in all I feel like items are over priced small in portion with a taste that is common without a kicked up notch Wanted to love it so bad ,negative,129,100-150,663,500-1000
Ok I normally would say 4 stars but because the amount of chaos to have someone help you made me not want to return for a while I like the pasties and desserts and they are pretty good but I timed it and I had to take a number 11 and they were on 1 It took 25 mins for me to get a small box of cookies They must have had at least 40 people standing around waiting to order or waiting for an order There was only 5 people working behind the counterseems fine right But what I noticed is there was NO URGENCY what so ever by any of the counter staff Next in the middle of the chaos of of the counter staff takes a large circular trayplate to arrange cookies to take across the street maybe for a restaurant or something She then walked them out and walked down the street I wouldnt say that is the appropriate time to arrange a plate and do deliveries especially when the place is jam packed It went to 4 people behind the counter Might have been smarter to handle customers in store and have deliveries handled another way Sorry but no cookies are worth 25 min wait And they should drill their staff to serve a customer within 3 min They would give much better customer service if they considered doing a retraining and changed it up a bit Ive been coming here for a few years and its always the same Time for a change,negative,259,250-300,1344,1000-1500
Almost every time I order something they make mistakes For example they forgot to make my coffee they served you different kind of muffin and they dont even apologize Everything is very expensive Bubbles are half cooked and not chewy at all People working in this places are not well trained and seem rude to me,negative,56,50-75,321,<500

Brown Butter Almond Brittle I recommend getting the 3 half scoop ice cream flight Make sure you are full of patience You will need to sample every flavor and so does the person in front of you The night we went there was no line Halfway thru our samples someone got in line behind us and we took 10 more minutes before we were able to settle on 3 flavors relationships lol Now we went after dinner this fall I cant imagine the capacity of ice cream foodies that Jenis accommodates during the summer Jenis is a great end to a date night in the Southend,positive,106,100-150,565,500-1000

Holy moley super good REAL ice cream Ive been here lots of times and it never disappoints Sometimes the line is long but it usually moves pretty quick and is worth it My favorite is butter pecan with pecans as a topping,positive,42,25-50,225,<500
Completely overpriced For 14 I got ripped Also they didnt offer me any samples of chocolate Last time we were here they handed out samples not this time When I asked the store manager said we dont have any available Really Probably wont be coming back any time soon The San Francisco location has better customer service,negative,57,50-75,337,<500
We had a few pastries yummy pistachio macaroons and delicious sandwiches If youre staying at the Venetian this little stand is so conveniently placed My only peeve is that I think the hours should be longer A few times we went down to try and get something but it was closed I could see myself needing a trip to this stand every time I come to Vegas,positive,67,50-75,356,<500

Popular French bakery Artwork displayed around is very interesting and will keep you entertained on their long but quick moving lines They also have great COVID security measures to keep you safe while you wait When you enter the series you are hit with the best buttery scents I love coming here for treats when I visit family and friends My personal favorite are the pecan and raspberry and lemon tarts Their macarons and chocolate croissants are also awesome I highly recommend,positive,82,75-100,491,<500
Amelies is a great spot to catch up with friends get work done and satisfy your sweet tooth We stop by Amelies quite frequently to pick up a sweet treat or breakfast sandwiches The interior is quite intriguing with the variety of colors and different design styles It is spacious with a good amount of seating but it tends to get packed very quickly The lines wrap around since its such a go to spot for many Our favorites are their macarons Pistachio and Salted Caramel and their cinnamon sticks As for breakfast sandwiches we tend to do the build your own and customize it to our likings,positive,108,100-150,605,500-1000
Had a long drive to try this out and we were not disappointed The basil lime sorbet and butter caramel are must try,positive,23,<50,117,<500

Has the whole world gone mad or is it just Jarlings thats all screwed up Lets make a quick list of the ingredients that SHOULD be in a peanut butter cup insert their knock off name for Blizzard here Snowstorm maybe 1 custard or ice cream or frozen yogurt or whatever you want to call it 2 peanut butter cups Where in this list do you see peanuts Try telling that to Jarlings I went back another day and had a grasshopper whatever theyre calling them Sleetstorm Whiteout Light Dusting of Snow Squall and it was admittedly delicious Too bad that when I tried to get in the car a burst of wind blew a bunch of melty shit out of the cup and all over my hands Now Im not saying that Jarlings is directly responsible for the 90 degrees and 40 mph winds that day Actually I guess that is what Im saying Shit never went down like that in California,negative,163,150-200,874,500-1000
Hands down my favorite ice cream place Not only do they have the best servers but they also have interesting and fun ice cream flavors I walked in on a quiet Sunday afternoon and I was immediately greeted by the server My friends and I tried almost all of their flavors and they were always very enthusiastic about them There was no limit and I loved that all of their spoons were metal One of my friends told the server to surprise him and the guy clapped his hands in excitement He ended up with a chocolate and coffee milkshake with chocolate ganache swirled in nutella whipped cream and a hot churro inside AMAZING The flavors at Masons change quite often but they are always delicious I ended up getting Coconut pudding and dark chocolate orange My only regret is that I did not have enough room for their Taro flavor which was creamy and very mild in the sweetness The decoration is very cute and rustic The whole experience is very fun and tasty,positive,175,150-200,975,500-1000
Very pretty desserts but taste it TERRIBLE The cake was so dry and the frosting was rock hard The filling was ok Im not sure why their ratings are so high Maybe people think looks really are everything,negative,38,25-50,207,<500
Im from San Diego I miss home and to know that Donut Bar opened up here in Las Vegas I had to go Not your traditional donuts these are more like your own personal small cake if you would The size of this donuts are enough to feed two or three people The place is great easy to find especially with neon sign out side the door Staff is awesome ambience is great  owners always there to great you and thank you with a friendly smile The only problem I have with this place is that I dont know what Donut to choose I go inn for one come out with half a dozen Its all good I can munch on them all day Great job guys and thank you for opening in Vegas,positive,135,100-150,663,500-1000
I came on two different occasions to get Ice cream and on both occasions they had no waffle conesseriously Why open and not be prepared for business,negative,27,25-50,150,<500
This is a newwave doughnut place which has a an interesting range of different and unusual doughnuts plus an attractive and wellthoughtout decor but where the doughnuts often seem mostly to look better than they taste and dont seem to taste as interesting as the ideas would indicate We tried a range of different ones including maple bourbon Homer mud pie and creme brulee Of these one of the best was the Homer despite the fact that it was huge and seemed likely just to be plain and sweet and seemed more of a novelty and likely to be characterless The Homer actually had the best doughnut flavour with good frieddough character and the icing was actually nice not just plain sweet The creme brulee and maple bourbon just seemed bland and unexpectedly just sweet with little other character The mud pie was pretty good Id try this again when in downtown Las Vegas but though it seems a worthy effort so far it is not nearly on the same level as other doughnut places Ive been to,positive,178,150-200,1006,1000-1500
I am so psychedI have one of their new mugs that you can get for about 13 so now every time I go refills of their liquid heaven are only 1 Deal of the centurynow I really wish they would open one closer to Salisbury,positive,45,25-50,226,<500
If I could give zero stars I would So I went to the bakery to buy cookies 3 weeks before I ordered the cof course I get there they were sold out I asked the owner that I wanted to order a cake she said I HAD to do it on line I said Im here I want to order it she said no thats not how we do it So I sent and email because thats how you order it Wait 2 days to get a response the pick up date was 219 also order cookies During the week I tried to get them to hold cookies and I was told no they couldnt Im like Im spending about 100 and you cant hold cookies They said no So I get there picked up the cake and the special cookies Thankfully they had cookies so bought some Well fast forward we cut the cake on my moms birthday and OMG The cake was raw The third layer on the top you can see it Im so disgusted I reached out to the owner and she seemed as she was going to do blues clue and find out Meanwhile Im embarrassed that everyone at the party was like whats that in the cake I expressed this to the owner and it meant NOTHING to her I got charged for the cakecookiesI even paid a tip Since when do bakeries do this She was not sympathetic nor did she offer me no type of compensation towards HER mistake Very disappointing and sad that she gets to do this and have no type of customer service,negative,274,250-300,1351,1000-1500
This ones real easy top marks all the way around The macaroons here are easily some of the best Ive had second only to the infamous LadurÃe and maybe another bakery Ive been to The usually have about 15 different varieties to choose from and always changing The cakes here are also impeccable personal faves are the carrot cake and some of their chocolate variants Everything is made in house and all in all one of if not the best bakery in CLT Check it out,positive,86,75-100,471,<500
I came here tonight after dinner after hearing all the rave reviews This place definitely lives up to the hype I got here around 930pm and this place was packed It probably took about 15 minutes of standing in line before placing my order which was fine because it gave me time to check out all of the different ice cream flavors The cashier that rang me up thanked me for waiting and was super sweet I really appreciated the good customer service I decided to order the heaps of love ice cream cup which contained oreos brownies cookie dough pecans caramel and chocolate ripples in vanilla ice cream It was so delicious The ice cream was so creamy and smooth It was almost halfway done by the time I reached my hotel lol I would definitely return here and would recommend this place to all ice cream lovers,positive,149,100-150,824,500-1000
Normally I would give this place high marks The macaroons are good albeit a little pricey This time we got the strawberry cake with buttercream icing single serving for over 5 bucks It was a let down because there were no strawberries or strawberry filling inside the cake There is one half a strawberry on top but that is all We will be back but do strongly believe there needs to be a recipe change for this cake,negative,78,75-100,429,<500
Dont waste your time or money here First you have to wait in a line to order your desserts then they send you to another line to pay Once you are waiting in line to pay they call you name you think its to pay for your order but they are just showing you your order after they have put it in the box now you have just lost your spot in line and have to wait again for them to call your name for a 2nd time The desserts were just OK i have had way better Worst of all they were extremely rude I wanted to buy a kids shirt which they had on display I asked for one and the girl just kept saying that they only had size small I could see bins full of tshirts I asked if it was childs SM or adult and all she could respond with was its just small I also was talking to another woman who was waiting she only ordered 1 pastry and was there before we got there she was still waiting even after i paid for my order She asked what was going on and the girl behind the counter and gave her a dirty look and said I called your name like 10 times and you never came up Her name was never called The employee just kept telling her that she should have been listening All around poor experience,negative,245,200-250,1206,1000-1500
I dont really like donuts but I heard this place is great and Ill try anything once so I decided to pick up a dozen and bring them into work the other day I had to wait in line and there were people coming in after me as well everyone was ordering 2 or 3 dozen donuts I suppose this proved they are indeed popular and tasty The lady who helped me with my order was personable the place seemed clean and the donuts did look quite nice Oh and just a note you have to pay with cash or check as they do not accept credit cards Back to the donuts I got a variety and my coworkers all said they tasted really good so that is what I am basing my review on I did eat one and it was AOk but it tasted like a regular donut to me so I cant really rate it on taste since its not my thing but I would definitely suggest this place to anyone who likes donuts A dozen was only 1095 so super cheap too,positive,186,150-200,911,500-1000
From all the ratings and pictures this seemed like an amazing place to have the ice cream sandwich I ordered a peanut butter and vanilla ice cream sandwich which took forever and then Im handed a squished doughnut with melted ice cream in a paper bag Very confused since I ordered directly from a picture someone posted which didnt remotely look the same but maybe the person who made my sandwich was new,negative,73,50-75,411,<500
So very disappointing and not up to Bouchon standards My family and I have been to Bouchon Bakery in Yountville California many many times and this Las Vegas location is inferior We are not quite sure why they arent keeping up with quality control but after going out of our way to get pastries there on our one day in Vegas we felt obligated to write a review We had butter croissants and almond croissants and they were all stale and awful They seemed to be day old at least We have not only been to Bouchon Bakery many times in California but we have also eaten at Bouchon Bistro in Yountville for various special occasions We have never been disappointed there and have always loved our meals Perhaps the Bouchon Bakery in Vegas is under different ownership,negative,138,100-150,776,500-1000
I love the atmosphere The decor is cute They are open 247 and it is a great location to study hold a meeting or kill time I had their Napoleon and it was one of the best desserts I have ever had,positive,42,25-50,201,<500
We went here specifically because the macaroons were recommended We had a chocolate raspberry and birthday cake They were all outstanding but we preferred the chocolate over the other two,positive,30,25-50,191,<500
Yelp challenge 3 Sloans is probably a new ice cream place I am not sure but I ran across this place while visiting Vegas Ordered coffee bean which tastes like coffee and the circus ice cream The circus ice cream is very interesting Its cotton candy flavored ice cream with gummies Its kinda like a kids dream to have cotton candy and gummies all at the same time The ice cream tasted yummy but the gummy twist was weird because it was very hard Dont get me wrong i love gummies but it was too hard and chewy Overall I loved this little shop,positive,104,100-150,558,500-1000
Great icecream nice fixins price is not too outlandish for what you get very clean casual atmosphere,positive,17,<50,105,<500
Truly a disappointing experience Having been to many 85 locations in CA I had high hopes that this location would be an amazing addition to my new hometown I came on Sunday 3820 at about 530 pm There was a long line but that didnt initially bother me However when you enter the store the line for the checkout staffed by one cashier was wrapped around inside The line was right thru the middle of the pastry selection area making it difficult to make any selection for the few pastries that were out as the people in line wouldnt move even after asking politely if you could reach around them to select a pastry The young man at the checkout was pleasant and very apologetic for the wait I assured him I knew it wasnt his fault Inadequate staffing is a managers fault and I saw no manager assisting in the mess I saw occurring in that store What disgusted me to no end was the employee working the coffee bar His hair was unkept and long and sticking out everywhere He seemed to have no feeling of any urgency to do his job as he was wandering all over the store while people stood waiting for their drinks He wandered several times to the back of the store behind the swinging doors and then would wander back to the coffee making area and never washed his hands The part where I wanted to vomit was when he made the drink then carried it over across the aisle with his hand over the top of the cup  now full with coffee there is no assembly line format for making drinks so its very disorganized I know that a food handlers permit is required in CA so Im going to assume that one is required in NV as well All the things I saw with this last employee violate the health code And with the world gone mad about the coronavirus it would behoove this particular employee to take health precautions seriously or find other employment I did not have him remake my drink as I was late for an engagement And didnt have time to wait another 30 mins for a drink It found its way to the trash instead,negative,381,300- 500,2036,2000+
Wonderful local bakery Ive been coming here since they opened a decade ago in a smaller location down the street Through all those years every experience Ive had with the staff has been positive and just about everything Ive ordered has been yummy The one thing I would not recommend is unfortunately the multigrain loaf Not because it isnt delicious but because the wheat grains baked into the loaf can be very hard I broke a tooth on one once,positive,80,75-100,460,<500
First time here I got a waffle cone and it was amazinggggg I also got the blueberry cheesecake ice cream which was also delicious There was a line out the door when we went but it was good and worth it,positive,41,25-50,205,<500
Disappointed dry cheese cake Walmart has better deals plus it was 13 bucks I cant believe it after watching the show thought this place would be amazing I guess they just going for looks not taste dont eat here not worth it,negative,42,25-50,225,<500
The pastries were not that great A friend had recommended to us so we had high expectations but left disappointed The strawberry dessert and the danish we had were dry the chocolate torte was hardtough like it had been sitting refrigerated for a few days The best was the eclaire Its a cute place but there are better bakeries that arent as expensive,negative,63,50-75,361,<500
This experience was not great We paid 18 for a miniature affogato and a 16 ounce shake for 11 bucks it should be at least 20 ounces I got the birthday shake and my dad got the affogato I chose the bday flavor for my shake The shake was below mediocre and tasted like watered down cake batter The affogato was okay and an okay price but the shake should have wowed me for 11 dollars Its not somewhere Id like to go back to and I wouldnt recommend it to anyone else,negative,93,75-100,478,<500
Atmosphere Milk is a small stand inside the Cosmopolitan We thought the fluorescent sign in the front was cute and great for pictures Service The service was solid The line to get the treat was a bit on the longer side but other than that we do not have much to complain about Food We ordered a cup of the cereal milk soft serve with toppings of sprinkles and cornflake crunch This was such an aesthetic cup of soft serve that looked really tasty and refreshing however our mouths would say otherwise The soft serve had very little taste and tasted vaguely of plain milk with a hint of old cheerios in it It definitely wasnt the sweet or rich milky ice cream we were expecting Additionally the sprinkles and cornflake crunch were alright additions but did not elevate the dessert except for looks Overall While Milk had such a cute aesthetic both in terms of the stand and the dessert our cereal milk soft serve was perhaps some of the most underwhelming soft serves weve ever had The only reason we would come back is to try other desserts or to take a picture of the soft serve and then melt it to use as overpriced milk,negative,208,200-250,1145,1000-1500
If you need a reason to wake up in Vegas its this place I went with the Buchon reuben sandwich and a chocolate croissant The sandwich is kept in the refrigerated case so I had them toast it for me but the inside was still a little cold  It tasted great though The dressing was very good and the pickled lettuce was a nice touch The croissant was just OK A flaky croissant with a chocolate filling I think this wouldve went well with a cup of tea or coffee Protip Dont forget to pick up some macaroons,positive,99,75-100,517,500-1000

Iv been watching Cake Boss for years now and after my experiences at Carlos Bake Shop I have come to the conclusion that Buddy and the Bakery is a case of a TV show making things look way better than they actually are One thing I noticed from the show is that Buddy excels at making Cakes LOOK amazing but have you noticed everything is produced from sheet cake Theres no real skill at baking a sheet cake even my 4 year old Niece can do that Visiting on a Tuesday evening the Bakery wasnt as busy as I expected so if you dont want to wait long this is the time to come The ordering system is all over the place and there are three yes THREE lines for the whole ordering process 1 Line to get into the Shop 2 Line to order Youre then stood awkwardly hanging around the till to have your name called to check your order is correct before then waiting again to have your name called again 3 Line to pay The items myself and my Sister In Law ordered were extremely underwhelming  Caramel Cupcake a hrefhttpwwwyelpcombiz_photoscarlosbakeshoplasvegasz99RKrkzTHMyAvPytNK2Pgyelpcombiz_photoscarla Cupcake was dry and there was barely any Caramel flavor The sponge itself was Vanilla with a lightly Caramel flavored whipped Cream Frosting and a blob of Chocolate  Caramel Pecan Cookie a hrefhttpwwwyelpcombiz_photoscarlosbakeshoplasvegasUMNG2Ovvk7h25q7uIl723wyelpcombiz_photoscarla Crumbly Sweet Buttery My favorite of the items I got  Jelly filled Cookie a hrefhttpwwwyelpcombiz_photoscarlosbakeshoplasvegasQRUgV7htWb05IsFC77sHdgyelpcombiz_photoscarla Tasteless dry My Sister In Law didnt like the items she got either  Chocolate Cupcake and Chocolate Brownie She said that the Cupcake went in the trash after 2 bites and the Brownies I made her just a few days before we a million times better Sorry Buddy just not feeling this,negative,298,250-300,1943,1500-2000
This is my kids favorite stop after a baseball game at The Mesas Park We would be giving them a five star rating but their service is a little bit slow But dont let that deter you the quality of their ice cream is well worth the wait,positive,48,25-50,238,<500

We went here tonight and the place looks nice the service was OK after someone showed up We got milkshakes with very little flavor At best they were OK My wife got a new peppermint shake and found no pepper minute to speak of I got the strawberry shake and really had no strawberries or strawberry flavor I get much better shakes at our local steak n Shake It seems like just an overpriced Hipster type ice cream shop I see no reason at all to go back there,negative,89,75-100,466,<500
Yes Im a fan of Milk Bar I didnt know too much about the desserts here when Milk Bar creator Christina Tosi opened up the first West coast location in the Cosmo Then we got to meet her at a Yelp event prior to opening and try the birthday cake and truffles that are signature items as well as a few of the cookies Thats the first time I tried the birthday cake and from then Ive been a fan Yes the cake is on the pricey side but its great for a special occasion when you want to treat yourself My friends and I ordered one for our July birthdays and shared it with a group of other pals because sharing is caring The item that Ive had multiple times is the cereal milk soft serve My favorite flavor is the Fruity Cereal Milk soft serve because it really does taste like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of Fruity Pebbles Apparently this flavor is only available at the Vegas and Toronto locations so lucky us The soft serve melts very quickly so have napkins ready The cake truffles are tasty little nuggets of goodness and Ive bought them as gifts for friends Im glad that we have this location here in town and look forward to another birthday occasion mine or someone elses for more cake Yelp Review 800,positive,233,200-250,1235,1000-1500
Wish I could give zero stars What I will add is the huge lack of respect the owner must have for their own customers I waited in line 25 minutes And then another 30 minutes to get my stuff Should of done what several people did leave Feel bad for the tourist who are wasting their precious time in Vegas to buy the crap they are selling here Hire more employees to pack orders Although this might be intentional to make people think they are more popular than they are If you have a car  go to Bagel Cafe GPS it Much of what you buy at Carlos can be found here Many times better  for less money,negative,120,100-150,609,500-1000

Yesterday we ordered 4 espresso drinks two double and two macchiatos and the coffee was so horrible that none of us was able to drink it We should have been warned when we asked what a cortado was and they told us it was an espresso with foam I knew it was an espresso with a drop of milk but just wanted to confirm I would like to go back because the place looks really good but if the quality of the coffee doesnt improve Ill continue going to espresso royale and Starbucks I just wish I could get my 15 back,negative,102,100-150,526,500-1000
Carlos bakery is overhyped and overpriced with declining quality over the past year or so I ordered a chocolate hazelnut birthday cake online 1 month in advance so theres no excuse for a shoddy job they did on the icing and lettering which had to be redone since the original didnt even spell the name correctly The cake had more icing than cake with no hazelnut flavor at all so it was a basic chocolate with the quality that you could get at a grocery store And what was that pearly kernel in the icing Ive purchased the white cake from the case several times which was better than the preordered cake Also they do not seem to care about return local customers so I will not be giving them any future business,negative,133,100-150,731,500-1000

I was so excited to know that there was a Carlos Bake shop in the Venetian Hotel in Las Vegas So I drove 4 hours to buy a lot of goodies for my husbands birthday tomorrow I was so excited to try there crumb cake cannolis and lobster tails but I was sadly disappointed The crumb cake was very dry and hard  The cannolis were ok The lobster tails were good but the crust could have been flakier I should have just stood with our local Portos Bakery in California theyre the BEST,negative,94,75-100,493,<500
Celebrating my birthday in Vegas and stopped for a slice of cake in the late afternoon No cake visible from counter maybe due to Covid but the girl helping us said they had yellow birthday cake and chocolate birthday cake I ordered a slice of the chocolate It was 16 so my hopes were high Not good The cake was dry The frosting was overly sweet if it was supposed to be buttercream you could not taste butter not even shortening Just sugar The top had something that looked like cookie dough but again tasted of pure sugar I was really disappointed in this place,negative,105,100-150,580,500-1000

I was excited to try out this Bakery that people were inline for at least 2 hours to buy a cake I called it in a day before and had placed the order and pick it up 1st the girl answered the phone were very nice but everything i asked she have to put me on hold at least 5min To check with the Baker that was happened apparently 3x times during our ordered conversation Then 2nd when we go and pick up the cake the cashier rush you out 3rd when i came home and opened the cake There wAs a cracked line on the cake I just want the store know that they should open the box before delivery to the client The cashier seem to rush me out because they ate busy But it taste good But was very disappoint of the decoration,negative,146,100-150,726,500-1000
This is by far the best ice cream around I was first introduced to Handels in Southern California I was so happy to see them build one in Vegas To be honest the location isnt the greatest but Im definitely willing to make the drive for this frozen goodness There are a ton of delicious flavors to choose from If you are new to Handles I highly recommend the 4 scoop sampler They give you a solid amount of ice cream for 425 I have tried 10 or so flavors but once I found my favorite flavor it has been hard to part from it My favorite is definitely Chocoholic Chunk If you like chocolate ice cream or dark chocolate in general you gotta try it It is super creamy and will quench your chocolate craving in no time at all I havent tried their shakes malts or coolers because their homemade ice cream is just too good on its own On Tuesday night they have 250 for one scoop in dish or sugar cone They give you a nice big scoop too Just a fair warning the line is huge on Tuesday nights But that said they move pretty fast at the window I cant recommend Handels enough,positive,209,200-250,1100,1000-1500
I though this place was just average Although they have a ton of flavors and I like that they let you sample its not a memorable ice cream place for me I didnt really care to try their ice cream sandwich The price was not worth the protein and a dollar for a toasted marshmallow Wow Its a very small establishment so seating is quite limited I had the ginger matcha and mint chip I thought the double scoop was pricey,negative,81,75-100,429,<500
Rude female employee asked her a question she spoke to me like I am not intelligent and as I was talking she turned her back on me and walked away,negative,30,25-50,147,<500
I expect a coffee place to serve coffee in ceramic coffee cup instead of a use and throw paper cup We drove 30 mins just to try out this place and there was no coffee in my mocha Yeah no kidding What I fail to understand is why will a place that is open 247 will serve coffee to its customers in a togo cup unless asked for it I would rather recommend you to go somewhere else especially if you live far away,negative,84,75-100,419,<500
Ice cream sandwich from freshly made and warm churros Lemon ricotta ice cream So fresh so clean so good Always wanted flavors at this place and great atmosphere in Ohio city,positive,31,25-50,176,<500
Ive always been a huge Jack Frost fan Their donuts are delicious and beautiful Unfortunately my recent experience was not a good one Last weekend I attempted to purchase donuts for two events The first was a order of cannoli donuts for a birthday party and the second was a donut cake I attempted to place these orders several times My repeated phone calls went unanswered and when Id stop in to place the order the shop would be sold out and closed When I finally went there and found them open I was told that I could not place a cake order The manager would have to call me I did place the order for the cannoli donuts and paid for them in advance Several hours later the manager called me and I placed the cake order paying for it over the phone as required When I arrived a few days later they gave me the cake and informed me that I had never placed the order for the cannoli donuts The woman who had told me this was the same one who had taken my order in person and who I had paid She attempted to text the manager who was once again not in the shop The manager did not answer She then found the order and told me they werent made She gave me two dozen donuts which were not the type I wanted and told me the manager would call me Ive waited an entire week to write this review hoping that Jack Frost would correct this issue that Id at least get a call from the manager and that theyd offer to make me the cannoli donuts They have not contacted me and at this point I doubt they will While Jack Frosts donuts are beautiful and delicious I dont see myself returning Their customer service is terrible Im truly disappointed in them,negative,319,300- 500,1680,1500-2000
WOW these cookies are so fire why is this my first time trying them I was too full the past few times I was at the cosmo but I made sure to visit them this time with a lighter meal to have them for dessert These cereal cookies do not disappoint They make them fresh and they are portionally sized and taste so good I wanted to go eat them again and my friend told me they have them packaged at Target so I had to get my fix on not the same The actually physical location cookies are twice the size and are the real deal Cant wait to come make another visit to this location or the one in LA the cookies are so bomb keep them coming and keep up the great tasting cookies I want to try and catch them for their seasonal flavors too Come and check out MILK bar,positive,155,150-200,777,500-1000
My daughter raved about this place so we tried it Its just Ok for me as I have had much better pastries elsewhere I dont live near this place so most likely I will not go back We went on Sunday 8pm the place was packed and desserts were continuously brought out from the kitchen It was too late in the evening to have espresso so couldnt comment on it,negative,70,50-75,360,<500
My all time favorite place to go in Charlotte Especially for a late night sweet tooth The delicate treats they have are so amazing The macaroons are absolutely delicious Great place to study and hangout,positive,35,25-50,209,<500
So went to The Windsor and had to try this out afterwards Ashley got a scoop of the butter pecan and I have to say that it was fantastic I got the oatmeal cranberry apricot cookie and the spiced molasses cookie The cookies were lightly crisp around the outside with a soft airy quality on the inside They were delicious and melted in my mouth Yummy,positive,66,50-75,354,<500
85C is a regular stop for me when visiting SoCal Im so happy that they made their way to Vegas I attended the grand opening several weeks ago and have been back a few times since then During my first couple of visits the selection was not too great because the bakery was very busy but the staff are getting their routine down and everything was wellstocked during my last visit The employees are friendly and helpful I havent tried anything that I didnt like Its a win for me,positive,90,75-100,491,<500

Im a pretty experienced ice cream eater and after my many years of eating ice cream this is my new favorite place Great ice cream delicious cone that complements the ice cream and great service I tried the thai tea french toast pumpkin pie sweet potato pie and salted caramel And these are the most accurate flavors I have ever had The french toast actually tastes like french toast I felt like I was at brunch except I was actually eating ice cream And they even added maple syrup on top of the scoop I thought it was a nice touch With the thai tea flavor they also added condensed milk on top Each ice cream flavor here is truly perfection Creamy and flavorful And the flavors actually taste like what they say they are Also the array of flavors here are vast and original I have never seen a sweet potato pie flavor And it is exactly what sweet potato pie would taste like too The cone here was also beautifully crafted They are made in house and go well with the ice cream Outside there is seating with cute lights And theres a mural of an ice cream cone too Very IGable Also the staff here are very friendly and didnt get irritated by my sampling They even offered me more samples after I had ordered my ice cream They never seemed annoyed or anything,positive,237,200-250,1298,1000-1500
Went early and hoping for freshly baked pastries however the pastries were cold and tasted day old,negative,17,<50,99,<500
The Donut Bar was not something we had planned to visit especially given the time of day but we decided to get some coffee and a donut Glad we did We got the donut stuffed with oreo and it was DELISH Not only was it the right size and not too much donut it paired very well with the coffee My husband had a donut left the next day and he said the other donut wasnt as good the second day but i think fresh is best earlier in the day  especially when there is a lot more variety Location is a bit small but its not like you sit and eat donuts at dunkin donuts we take them to go I hope to try some other donuts next time were in Vegas,positive,134,100-150,647,500-1000
Ive always wanted to try their birthday cake so when I saw they had a birthday cake shake I saw my opportunity to try it without spending 50 on a small cake 10 on a 12 oz shake that I think they used prepackaged birthday cake truffles do they even make the truffles fresh in house It was okay I got a floury taste which was kind of weirdunexpected For 10 Cant say this was totally worth it,negative,78,75-100,413,<500
These donuts were delicious The customer service was over the top great The little court yard out back gave us a nice place to eat without being in others space I am sad were not in Vegas long enough to go twice I would highly recommend this place Be mindful that they are only open until they sell out,positive,59,50-75,312,<500
Waiting lines are too long and the employees are way too chill to take care of you In the end the quality or the taste of the products are way below expectations Go somewhere else,negative,35,25-50,182,<500
The pastries I have gotten from here are amazing they are fresh light and the flavor is spot on I especially was impressed with the taro bun So why four stars Two things for me knocked this place first there was a terrible smell in the store when I was there like rotten eggs or something Even with a face mask on it was hard to stand in line my husband went outside to wait Second I tried their salted cream iced coffee and was not terrible impressed had a weird fake sugar taste I would rather go next door for my drink and stick to baked goods here and hope the smell was a one off,positive,117,100-150,603,500-1000
This place is a hidden gem They had fun unique kinds of ice cream and had a doughnutice cream sandwich that was unbelievable On top of that the owner was thanking every single customer walking in Talk about amazing customer service Thank you Novel Ice Cream Im going to tell all of my family and friends about you guys,positive,59,50-75,327,<500
The music is WAY TO LOUD You have to scream what you want The donuts are tasteless How can that be My grandson would not eat them and hes 7t they are the worst tasting donuts I have ever eaten they have no flavor And the cost is ridiculous for a tasteless donut,negative,53,50-75,271,<500
The line can get long and its pretty slow They only have 2 cashiers if they are both working and people myself included like to ask a million questions about each item Luckily when I came here the first time there wasnt a line Friday around 830pm and it was pretty quick We purchased a 6in round red velvet cake the day before for my bosses birthday They will write anything you want on it for free While there I took advantage of having no line and also purchased a carrot cake cupcake not my favorite and the lobster tail WOW I figured the lobster tail would be pretty lightweight but considering its a custardwhipped cream mix I should have known This thing was dense flaky and delicious Honestly it almost had too much filling I took most of it out and picked around it because I felt guilty for how fattening it probably was but its definitely worth trying and splitting with 1 or 5 people  Since we paid for the cake the day before we didnt have to wait in the horribly long line come Saturday evening before dinner we got there just before our 730pm reservation at another place nearby Thankfully we paid beforehand because the line was INSANELY long Luckily the cake ready to go and packaged nicely All in all it took just a few minutes to get the cake and head out the door People looked pretty upset that we walked straight up but hey we already paid for it The cake was delicious moist and flavorful Everyone enjoyed it and the price was definitely fair for the size I think we paid 3640,positive,281,250-300,1549,1500-2000
Went in at a nonbusy time Two gentlemen working the counter completely ignored my family and we couldnt place an order A family walked in behind us and was immediately served by calling the number system which clearly said was for busy times only and there was no one there else waiting to be served Ok we grabbed a number and as soon as we approached the counter the other guy just left and went to talk to the other worker servicing the family behind us We left without placing an order The only conclusion I can reach is that they are racists that work at this store as my family is a mixed race family and the people behind the counter were white and seemed to be eager to help the white family who came in after us Please be aware of this if you are thinking about trying out this bakery,negative,153,150-200,801,500-1000
Basically the best thing since sliced bread Definitely worth the trip outside of Champaign,positive,14,<50,93,<500

I stopped by here for a light breakfast while wandering around the Venetian I had high expectations due to the reputation of the bakery and I was not disappointed I ordered a chocolate croissant and a coffee macaron Honestly this was one of the croissants Ive ever had Every bite was a perfect combination of flaky airy tender layers with plenty of chocolate The macaron was deliciously chewy with wonderful coffee flavor Speaking of coffee it was pretty good as well Honestly though I was more focused on the food and wasnt blown away by the beverage The location was a little difficult to find Its not near the Bouchon Bistro which is kinda confusing but tucked away behind an escalator on the main casino Im sure there is always a line especially for breakfast However the line moved pretty quickly Its a little more expensive but youre paying for quality and its definitely worth it I cant wait to come back and try more if the delicious pastries,positive,169,150-200,985,500-1000
Absolutely Phenomenal As an ice cream connoisseur I can say that this is one of the best ice creams I have ever had The Toffee Bourbon and Madagascar vanilla were absolute heavenly masterpieces Stop by and you will not be disappointed A bit hard to locate  but they are next nestled next to third space on Grand avenue,positive,59,50-75,325,<500
The Cake Boss should be ashamed of his store The service was horrible and we never had any cake We waited 45 mins,negative,23,<50,116,<500
Five stars on the service and bakery However their food is way too salty I ordered the ham  cheddar omelette and the ham is the saltiest ham Ive ever had in my life This is way beyond the level of salt a human being can have for a day to stay healthy And their mixed green salad on the side is also salty  due to their dressing Just a warning,negative,72,50-75,351,<500
I met up with a couple of friends while on my somewhat annual Christmas trip to Charlotte My friends were late due to traffic and laundry so I sat in Amelies on a couch by the door for about an hour yeah I know and the staff didnt even care THIS IS A GOOD THING I didnt get any dirty looks for not buying anything nor did I get asked if I wanted anything They just let me sit there and wait And people watch The vibe of Amelies is really laid back One of my friends cant remember who sorry said that it was like a little piece of Boone in Charlotte I wouldnt really say all that but I definitely appreciated the mix of clientele from people getting off of work from their corporate jobs to hipsters coming to hang out to young parents coming to pick up snacks to whoever else happened to walk in to get anything ranging from coffee to a loaf of French bread I stayed for quite a while with my friends again not a problem with the staff at all and was good with it all until about 10 pm where the crowd seemed to gravitate more towards groups kids I can say kids right who are excited to not be at home with their parents and people dressed up for the skanky Charlotte bar scene Thats when my friend and I finally took our queue to leave But not before having a cup of awesome coffee a croque monsieur a fruit tie a salted caramel brownie a cup of earl gray and a croissant I told you I was there for a while Probably like 5 or 6 hours The food was all delicious The croque monsieur had a little more mustard than I wouldve liked but Im not a fan of mustard The salted caramel brownie was AMAZING It was perfectly sized and had equal parts salted caramel and fudgy brownie The croissant just tempted my from the display case so I HAD to eat it The fruit tie While ginormous I prefer the kolochies totally butchered that word but hey Im not Polish made by the locals in Chicago Final verdict Ill be bringing Joe the next time we go to NC and the food is kinda pricey I guess and nothing out of this world except that brownie but the atmosphere is totally worth it,positive,407,300- 500,2148,2000+
Overpriced Low Value Long wait times Poor quality If these things describe your coffee go here,negative,16,<50,96,<500
I had their pink sprinkles and creme brulee There was nothing special about them The filling for the creme brulee was one sided and minimal The pink sprinkles one was not even moist on the inside It was very dry And even with a mustache the lady called me maam lol,negative,51,50-75,272,<500
The cashier guy was rude He was supposed to say something like hello morning But he just stared at me so I felt like he must have been broken up yesterday Of course coffee came out in silence Overall this place can be nice but services sometimes suck,negative,48,25-50,261,<500
They offered a large selection of pastries and beverages So many tea and coffees that are sealed with plastic and you shake them up Grab a tray and start loading up in self serve pastries Since this The reason for the low rating 1 Long wait for 2 drinks So many people but it took a long time 2 1 Bathroom was out of order leaving one one in operations Super dirty at 1130 am Wet floor and paper towels everywhere No seat covers for the kids Bathroom was totally neglected 3 Only one napkin dispenser and 1 trash bin available Considering the size of space there should be one more Please take this feedback to improve your operations Since this is the first one in Vegas I understand you may need to get up to par with your LA locations but please do better in all areas,negative,148,100-150,793,500-1000
Delicious Got the pistachio and matcha ice cream Wife got the taho Highly recommend the taro taho,positive,17,<50,101,<500
I got two flavors Vietnamese coffee and Butter pecan in a waffle cone The Vietnamese coffee flavor was spot on It had specks of coffee grounds It was perfect because the coffee flavor wasnt too strong and it wasnt too sweet The butter pecan was really good too I would definitely go back to try different flavors I also got a cup of coffee which was not good Dont get coffee here Stick to the ice cream,positive,77,75-100,416,<500
The ice cream was delicious the flavors were creative without being too wacky and the portions were generous,positive,18,<50,111,<500
Such a cute place and the ice cream was great I was going to get a few toppings but the girl didnt ask and I felt rushed to the register Other than that everything was perfect,positive,36,25-50,179,<500
Quite the cafÃ and bakery with an eclectic twist A bit overpriced yet the sandwiches and soup were devine I can see myself spending lots of time here Two thumbs up,positive,31,25-50,168,<500
These were the worse macarons Ive had in a long time Smh Extremely HARD and for 2 a pop,negative,19,<50,92,<500
Place was horrible First and foremost we grabbed a number which was B89 and waited over 2 hours for our number to get called One of the most disorganized companies I have ever seen I understand things were busy but the way of doing business was horrible and we noticed a lot of people leaving purely because of the wait Second once we finally got our number called I was informed the pie that I had ordered 4 hours earlier was not made The manager came out and spoke to me and before even apologizing blamed it on me because I had not prepaid She tried to explain how the process worked if I would have prepaid for the pie but did not apologize or offer a solution outside of waiting another 40 minutes for my pie to be made Absolute worst customer service I have ever seen from a manager On top of that prepaying for my pie was never even provided to me as an option which only made things worse Would not recommend this to anyone unless you are looking to waste a few hours on the strip and if you dont want to get your order correct,negative,201,200-250,1056,1000-1500
Not sure what all the hype is or why Mikey Chen recommended this place we came here at 11am and bought 4 donuts one of which was the highly hyped crÃme brÃlÃe They all tasted very dry and stale Not worth paying 3 a piece Maybe it was an off day Whatever it was we wont be coming back nor recommend this to anyone,negative,64,50-75,327,<500

Ive been hearing about the amazing sweets served in this establishment in New York and Los Angeles Since we wee near the area showing out of towners around we thought Why not Located in Cosmopolitan Hotel in between Momofoku and Eggslut the establishment is pretty small and only has one bench for a couple of people to sit on There is a bright pink neon sign that signals you have reached your destination The menu is shown above the cash registers They offer various things from soft serves milkshakes prepackaged cookies and different sweets Thankful there was no line we decided to try a cereal soft serve with corn flakes After ordering and paying at the cashier you wait by the window on the right for them to serve you your order Orders came quick but I would hope so considering they are basically just preparing ice cream in a cupprepackaged desserts in the front The soft serve was very underwhelming Yes It tasted like cereal milk That was the whole point However for 10 Not worth it The portion was very small and the corn flakes tasted bland and somewhat gross If you like them however you would be very thankful that probably 13 of the cup is filled with corn flakes in the bottom as well as topped on the soft serve For all the hype for this establishment I was honestly expecting way more Maybe I would try the prepackaged pastries and cookies if they were offered to me However I would not be returning Very disappointing,negative,260,250-300,1481,1000-1500
I have been to Masons twice now and both times I have not been impressed I went a second time because I thought I was crazy for not loving them like so many people do I had Pumpkin Pie which tasted okay as a sample and my boyfriend had Butter Pecan They both lacked the creamy texture that you would expect from ice cream and tasted more like freezerice and fell apart as we ate it The ice creams taste like they barely have any of the main ingredient in them seriously lacking flavor It was a sad day for our tastebuds and my waistline because I finished eating it since I paid for it and didnt even enjoy it On the bright side they play good music have cool decor and a nice vibe and color changing spoons Ill stick to Mitchells and Sweet Moses,negative,146,100-150,766,500-1000
flavors were much too sweet for me and nothing stood out about the texture except that there too many add ins but maybe i have been getting the wrong flavors usually been somewhat disappointed after my visits here but im a harsh critic,negative,43,25-50,239,<500
Maybe my expectations were too high after so many good reviews and the recent article in the Plain Dealer but after going with my family of 5 and having several different flavors amongst us we were not impressed There was a noticeable waxy tastefeel that was more noticeable with some flavors than others Not a stop that we will make again,negative,61,50-75,347,<500

So Handels changed their cup design for their hot fudge sundaes The cups are now designed to hold them in your hand easier but there is definitely less ice cream in them Yet they still charge the same price Not cool,negative,41,25-50,220,<500
Go and get the Lemon Blueberry its a seasonal cupcake Key Lime Chocolate Marshmallow and Red Velvet cupcakes all came home with me in a box My favorite was the Chocolate Marsmallowmmmm very chocolately with a sweet sugary bite of marshmallow in the centerthe frosting was perfection Key Lime had meringue swirled on top It was tart but not my fave The red velvet was devoured by the kids and the lemon blueberry was delish The last time I visited a Sprinkles was when they had their grand opening in Scottsdale Lots of super young kids working behind the counter that didnt know what they were doingand I wasnt too impressed with the baked goods So I never went back But now with the kids in tow how could we pass up a bakery I was so happy that despite the number of employees behind the counter service was speedy friendly and helpful and the cakes were delicious If youre not into cupcakes the sweltering heat might force you to come in and have some icecream or have some cake and icecream Just imagine youre at a birthday party Located in the new Linq shopping area near the HighRoller you cant miss the huge sign,positive,205,200-250,1148,1000-1500
This has to be the best ice cream place Ive ever been to and coming from a pregnant woman that says a lot It was a really cool environment inside with the factory right behind the store where you can look in through a glass wall I got a root beer float and they use homemade whipped cream which was absolutely INCREDIBLE Best ever Hands down Staple of downtown Cleveland,positive,70,50-75,379,<500
Found this place after eating AYCE Sushi There is always place for desert with me Ill let you guess how I found this place It was via Yelp I was towing a trailer with my car on it so it was a little bit hard to manuver around the side streets GPS was taking me but when I found it I just parked it right in the front Their lot was not big enough for my truck and trailer Plus that evening when I went it was packed I got the peanut butter chocolate ice cream sundae with whip cream Man it was good and rich I loved every last scoop of it The pricing here is fantastic Its not over priced at all I almost thought the price was wrong for a second but it wasnt Other then that I will be coming back here 100 when Im in Cleveland and want pretty damn good ice cream Ive ever had,positive,161,150-200,796,500-1000

This ice cream shop does have some neat flavors to choose from like Cinnamon Toast Crunch and Mango but it is simply just a good scoop of ice cream nothing spectacular I had a cookie added to mine for their signature macaron ice cream sundaes but sadly the cookie was just the top half of it and it tasted stale,negative,60,50-75,314,<500
I just met you Jack Frost but I love you Came in around noon and had a few dozen different flavors to choose from I opted for blueberry jelly and you were so nummy Normally I wouldnt use a word like nummy but its the right word to use in this situation I also like that the donuts are a tad on the small side More taste and fewer calories at least I can hope,positive,75,50-75,370,<500
Yep  this place deserves every star I gave it and every star everyone else gave it Ive had the donuts before when people at work had them and always meant to go in and grab some of my own but never made it there till this morning I know some people have an issue with the location  old building  but people Jack Frost only cares about the quality of the donuts and its apparent  theyre SO good Got a half dozen this morning and an apple fritter dont worry Im going to share Donuts included blueberry pumpkin peanut butter chocolate caramel apple reeses peanut butter cup and salted caramel Pumpkin amazing Blueberry  amazing The apple fritter is the size of my head if not bigger The 6 donuts were in a smaller box apple fritter in a box made for a dozen granted it didnt take up the entire box but still huge All in all spent 925 and it was mainly because of the fritter 12 dozen is less than 6 dollars Amazingly fresh donuts amazingly cheap prices sweet people behind the counter  whats there not to love PS bring cash or a check no creditdebit here,positive,204,200-250,1135,1000-1500
So I cant comment on the food from here but the service we received here today was nothing short of inexcusable Im not one to post rant reviews as Im in the service industry out here and realize most are bs We came in I the bakery and pulled a ticket Looking in the case at all the baked goodies and literally 30 seconds had gone by and they called the number before we could see what number we where We asked a question about something in the case and the clown behind the counter turned in to a ass responding in a aggressive tone I have already called that number three times what do you want Now mind you we have been in the store a whopping 3 minutes The guy proceeds to be a dick with the manager standing right beside him and acts like everything is fine When she realizes we are unhappy her only response was maybe he is having a bad day I get it you dont reprimanded employees out on the floor but you dont pretend like nothing is wrong I could care less if your having a bad day Welcome to the tourist industry buddy put on a smile and pretend to be nice to the people that come in to spend money We had family that came into town a had two things she wanted to do while she was here One was to go to this place Shame on the clown behind the counter and shame on the manager for not being able I do her job,negative,266,250-300,1340,1000-1500
There ice cream is definitely above average but I resent having to take out a loan to pay for it There is better ice cream for much less,negative,28,25-50,138,<500
Fresh bread FRESH BREAD This is what you keep hearing when you seat there for a while having your coffee and more One guy comes out the kitchen saying fresh bread and all the staff answers I should say screams FRESH BREAD  This is kind of funny at the beginning but after seating there for half an hour it gets on your nerves Besides that I got a latte and didnt think that was the best one Ive ever had In fact it was served in a to go cup and it felt not full like only 34 Anyway nothing special We got the chocolate truffle cake that we shared It tasted fridgy meaning not made that day but probably refrigerated for 1 night or so Chocolate used to bake it was not high quality This bakery is located on Spring Mountain right in the middle of Chinatown in a new plaza The design of the place is nice staff very busy I understood its a chain coming from California When you come in either you line up to get coffee and pastries or you take a tray and you help yourself with different kind of breads Nice concept but to me they should improve the quality  This place could be a nice spot to hang out with friends if it was better,negative,225,200-250,1171,1000-1500
Been to many ice cream shops from coast to coast and by far this chain has the best chocolate shakes Its trouble we live up the street from this place,positive,30,25-50,156,<500
A little difficult location to find but once we arrive we knew it would be a great time The flavors of ice cream are amazing and theres a great variety We went with mini daddys and still left satisfied The price is reasonable for this decadent and clinically insane dessert and shows for a great treat during summer Leaving very happy,positive,61,50-75,346,<500
I went to the cupcake ATM so cooooool by the way because I didnt feel like waiting in line inside There were about 10 choices of cupcakes to choose from and I picked the sprinkles It looked great frosting was caked in sprinkles so I didnt hesitate to dig in Wellit was terrible The frosting was almost inedible sweet where all I could taste was powdered sugar The cake portion was flavorless even though it was laced with sprinkles I ate half and threw it out wasting a very valuable 450 on a less than mediocre cupcake On the plus side the packaging was really cute,negative,106,100-150,586,500-1000
Dont send your child in alone The girl behind the counter told our grandson the machine was broken so his kid cup was filled only onethird of the way about 5 tablespoons and watery although he still paid full price and tipped When he returned to the car he was obviously disappointed so I went in to ask about it The shift manager told me thats how they come now and then added Have a nice day I guess rudeness and minion size portions is how they roll As for us we walked over to Cullivers where my grandson got a real size cup of ice cream with great customer service,negative,111,100-150,586,500-1000

I had the strawberry cupcake and my cousin had red velvet For me the strawberry cupcake didnt have any strawberry flavor only the icing They asked if we wanted them separate we said yes So she just put them in a bag that flipped over All the icing which was the best part of the cupcake was on the side of the bag Usually we get a box for a single cupcake but not that day 53117,negative,77,75-100,389,<500
We walked in to Mary Coyles at 845pm on 1230 excited to eat some ice cream after a particularly crappy day When we got to the counter to order our Hot Tin Roof and Hot Copper Roof we were told all of the toppings were already put away and that we could only order scoops Very disappointing Why say youre open until 9 if youre really closing before then We felt like an inconvenience to the two young ladies rolling up the mats and wiping down the entire restaurant while we hurriedly ate our ice cream Very good ice cream though,negative,101,100-150,542,500-1000
The owners and staff are extremely friendly and nice Ive been 3 times since they opened last week The shakes are sooo yummy I highly recommend the Cosmo  Wanda and Scooby Snacks,positive,33,25-50,184,<500
This is pretty much the best place for hand made ice cream If you are going there one should definitely try their dough melt It is the best concept ever They will put a scoop of your choice of flavor between a hot bun The combination is OMG This is a must try if you are in the city,positive,59,50-75,288,<500
Great little place but its not a place to hang out as theres no inside seating Theres a few benches and grassy area but the storefront is located at the entrance of the strip mall Theres 100s of flavors to choose from and they even have flavors of the month You can ask for a sample especially for those with vague descriptions like Graham Central Station Prices arent cheap about 350 for a scoop It was a nice scoop and you can even say a generous scoop but its still one scoop of ice cream Was it the best ice cream Ive ever had Hmm not sure It was good and it hit the spot on a warm Memorial Day evening,positive,121,100-150,632,500-1000
If youre thinking of coming here because you fell in love with Bouchon Bakery in Napa as I did dont The macarons and other baked goods dont hold a candle to the flagship shops the macarons were tough and dry Whats worse is the service here is absolutely terrible The woman that was helping me was rude and made me feel like she was doing a favor by taking my order and packing up my notso goodies Save your time and money,negative,82,75-100,438,<500

I never got to try the donuts because the manager at this establishment was very rude We were so excited to try these donuts so we showed up at 7 am on Sunday morning because when we called the day before the employee told us that we could preorder and pick up at 7 am However we decided to just to go right when they open So once we got there we were greeted rudely by the manager telling us we werent allowed in to buy any donuts since they dont open until 8 am We then decided to call to make an order on the phone which the employee told us that we could pick it up right away even though they havent opened So we decided to place the order and were so excited waiting outside for our donuts however we waited for 40 mins and no one came out We decided to give them a call back and the employee stated that the manager wouldnt allow him to sell us the donuts at that point we were fed up and decided to leave because they were rude and unprofessional They should have given us a call back instead of making us wait for 40 mins Now I will never go back to an establishment that has bad customer service even if they are rated highly,negative,228,200-250,1151,1000-1500
I went this morning for a coffee and an almond croissant It wasnt busy but the girl working the cash forgot to give me the croissant so I had to stand there being ignored until one of her coworkers clued in to the fact that I was waiting for something The pastry was good The coffee was pretty blandI dont think it was an execution thingmore of a beans thing Im only providing feedback because I expect more from a Keller joint,negative,82,75-100,443,<500
This place was absolute crap Got a stale cookie a stale cupcake and a mediocore cheesecake Avoid this place like a plague I spent 20 for these 3 items,negative,29,25-50,156,<500
Went a couple of weeks ago The hype was still pretty high Got my pastries and got in in the long line There was a table in the middle of the queue where a worker was bagging the pastries so they wouldnt have to bag it up at the front register This table ended up making a very awkward gap in the queue  particularly if someone had a lot of stuff to be bagged it just back the line up I was next I only had 3 items so it wouldnt take long for me but while the guy was bagging my 3 items another employee who was originally manning the door let about 6 other people from behind me go past me leaving me now at least 6 peoples behind The people who cut me did not exactly understand that what they did wasnt cool cultural differences if you catch my drift Im not blaming them I told the worker well hey now those people cut me can I move to the front I was next he just kinda shrugged it off nervous about what to say I then told the girl who let those people in front of me she also just laughed and said ohhh  and continued on working I then told a different girl cleaning the lobby and explained what had happened she let me go next in line  They need to work on their queues theyre unorganized and take too long,negative,249,200-250,1270,1000-1500
Yum I love Jarlings I love the smell of the waffle cones inside I love the cute chinese food takeout boxes they pack the pints in I love sitting out on the wooden benches and watching the fourth of july fireworks and I love that cold fudge and  or butterscotch can be mixed into anything The new brownies that they use arent as good as the old ones though,positive,70,50-75,365,<500
The pastries are mediocre definitely not worth the time or money Save your time and go to Bouchon Bakery easily 10 times better The staff at Carlos bakery is incompetent at least the night I went We ordered 10 different items which for some reason took them 20 minutes to box up Before paying the gentleman showed us the boxes and asked if it looked correct upon examining the items we informed him that the order was not correct Another 20 minutes went by and finally the cashier called us over I asked her what was inside the boxes and explained how the first time around the order was screwed up her response to me was I dont know read the receipt how rude What if I was a tourist and was illiterate Long story short I got to my hotel room and yet again the order was wrong,negative,149,100-150,801,500-1000
This place really is a gem Very creative flavors nice owners always wanting to accomodate their customers etc They just seem like real donuts for lack of a better term They arent oversized or too sugary or slathered with too much icing that you dont even want to eatmany of the flavors are a good balance of sweet and salty Im partial to the raspberry cruellers  but Ive never had a bad donut there,positive,75,50-75,419,<500

How is possible with a French name Bouchon have such a terrible croissant Should have believed the Yelper who wrote that the pastries were staled and the bakery wasnt good We bought two croissants at 1045am one was almond the other was apple Those were probably the worst croissants we ever had They were so dry that they were coming apart like a crumbling cookie Thats just unacceptable for the name and the location We didnt complain and didnt return them but probably should have one bite and in the trash they go Should have gone back to Jean Philippe Patisserie in Aria which had better selection and top of the line pastries This review is for the bakery only Im sure the restaurant is a lot better I hope,negative,130,100-150,739,500-1000
Adorable place with fantastic donuts The creative donuts here are the reasons why I wanted to give this place a try Its like a new wave going on with donut chains popping up in cities I feel a little bad for the mom and pop shops theyre going to have to step up their game Its one thing to have cute and creative donuts but the most important part is that it has to taste good as well I wanted to try the pretzel shape donut but I didnt see it when I got there so the the worker told me about a french toast donut that was made fresh It took about several minutes to make and it tasted just like what it was called a French Toast Donut It was literally a french toast donut I also ordered the bitrhday donut with oreo inside and a glazed buttermilk for my boyfriend All the donuts we ordered exceeded or expectations I cant wait to come back next time and hopefully get my hands on the pretzel donut When youre there dont forget to check out their incredible aquarium created by the guys from TANKED,positive,195,150-200,1028,1000-1500
Novel has the best name because that is exactly what it is It unique and special and like nothing else The ice cream is really to die for or kill for if necessary Then of all things they take the deliciousness and place it between two halves of a warm decadent donut right Its a cute tiny shop with a lot to offer Super customer service the peeps running this show are very cool and not just cause there is ice cream in there Dont be a dumb and miss your chance for a mouth pleaser,positive,96,75-100,493,<500
You want it to be awesome You have this building sense of excitement as you walk the Grand Canal Shops like when you were a kid running down the stairs on Christmas morning Then you get thereand its all downhill from then on Now I grew up with these bakeries on Long Island its more than red and white string tied around a box thats makes an Italian bakery an Italian bakery Buddywhat happened I watched my wife wait an hour for her ticket number to come up and she had only 25 people ahead of her Yes you think a 3 minute wait time per customer is good right But not when you have 3 workers on the counter assisting Not only that the bakery service area is about the size of a small Starbucks Yet right across the hallway is Buddys signature restaurant and not only is it absolutely massive in size its absolutely dead inside I saw 3 four tops 2 bored hostesses and a line cook that probably regrets applying for a job there Why in the world did you not make a massive bakery area and a cute cafe type dinner place is beyond me Seriously you have Mario Batali just down another hall and thats good damn Italian food Youre a baker Buddy you should have just stuck with that and made a killing with a large quick paced bakery cranking out our East Coast patisserie memories Not a closet bakery with a huge show window with a guy filling cannolis Remember a fish may love a birdbut where would they live BTW the cannoli was great for what you can get on the West coastbut barely on par what I can get at my old bakery out on the Island,negative,297,250-300,1591,1500-2000

Ice cream good however I didnt try the flavors I wanted because the girl behind the counter made it feel as though her job was an inconvenience Got what sounded good but not ultimately what I wanted because I felt bad asking for different tasters,negative,45,25-50,249,<500
I tried the normal cereal milk one I wanted the birthday cake one but it had eggs and I am allergic So the cashier let me have the plain one no idea if that meant it didnt have eggs it was a weird transaction Anyway as for the hypeI dont get it Taste literally just like milk No other flavorkind of salty I had the crunch flakes on it too Kind of expensive after all that so I ate it all even though i wasnt in love They were also offering free samples of cookies or the ice cream to some people in line but I didnt get in on that  But I have a friend who went here multiple times was on their trip and tried all types of stuff and loved it So I guess if you like that salty sweet combo this is for you,negative,149,100-150,729,500-1000
I never write reviews but do not waste your time on the cookies I should have been suspicious since theyre packaged in plastic meaning they werent baked there Anyway they were so stale and hard that even heating them up in the oven didnt do them any justice Way too sweet and one dimensional like you can barely taste the chocolate chips Sadly I bought 6 of them such a waste,negative,71,50-75,390,<500
Cool concept trendy but really desserts and pastries Are dry no flavor I was expecting fresh flavorful pastries what I got was frozen out of a box,negative,27,25-50,148,<500
Not sure why I havent reviewed Masons yet I must have been busy stuffing my face with endless scoops of their incredible ice cream I was really excited to see someone taking over the old Ohio City Ice Cream spot and eagerly anticipated their opening This place is dangerously close to my house and I now find myself there on a weekly basis I used to be a diehard Jenis fan but if you can believe it this is better Yes I said it its BETTER than Jenis They do an excellent job of coming up with new flavors and constantly having new things to try I swear I taste at least 8 flavors every time Im in there They also have a few vegan flavors for those who are milkaverse in your life or those who arent theyre actually creamy unlike some of the other vegan ice creams Ive tried If the amazing ice cream isnt enough to keep you coming back Jesse and Helen are so friendly they make you feel like you belong there My only complaint is that theyre not open everyday but I guess they need some time to make more ice cream for me to eat and I need to control my ice cream eating habits,positive,212,200-250,1112,1000-1500
We go to Handels a lot for their amazing ice cream However this past visit we felt that the service was appalling We went for Fathers Day because my husband wanted one of the amazing monster milkshakes He ordered and I ordered a cone with 2 flavors The server said that I would have to order a double which is 4 12 scoops of ice cream if I wanted two flavors A single is 2 12 scoops He insisted that he could not do 1 scoop of one flavor and 1 12 scoops of another Which seems crazy to me And I know they have done it before Then my friends ordered and paid the whole bill After they paid they saw that we were double charged the milkshake and my cone When we brought it to their attention the server was curt and handed her 650 the cost of the milkshake My friend pointed out that she was still owed for the cone and tax So the manager came over and was just as curt He finally gave her the cash back and then slammed the window shut I was shocked It is too bad because every other time the women who served us were friendly and accommodating These two gentlemen the server and manager need to up their game,negative,221,200-250,1138,1000-1500
I really wanted to like this place I waited in line for almost an hour which I was willing to do I thought the experience was cool to watch the bakers and the service was well organized but none of the pastries were impressive we order the tiramisu canolis cheese cake crumb cake boston cream cake snow balls I would rather eat at the Bouchon bakery nearby,negative,67,50-75,368,<500
I went here with my husband for my birthday and was not disappointed I ended up getting the stout flavor Its unique but completely delicious I just wish they had a bigger range of flavors,positive,35,25-50,193,<500
Located in the middle of a quiet neighborhood Not a lot of parking 34 spots but there is street parking available I was surprised by the wide range of baked goods they offered They also had cakes along the wall that were beautifully decorated We ordered an iced coffee and the bread pudding The bread pudding was very moist and coffee was good Overall very nice decor and atmosphere,positive,69,50-75,394,<500
I had high hopes for this after watching Netflixs Chef Table I really admired Christina Tosis creativity and hard work but everything we tried were not good at all Ive messed up a lot of cookies but they were edible The compost cookie was so hard and tasted like banking soda we threw it away after a bite The blueberry and cream was ok and soft but lacking the tasted of blueberry crack pie was so teeny for 6 but I guess its The Strip Buttery but not that amazing The birthday truffles were ok The cereal milk with cornflakes was definitely worth it and it tastes exactly what a cereal milk taste like But other than that maybe the NYC location is better,negative,124,100-150,677,500-1000
This is seriously good ice cream And they are so welcoming  encouraging you to taste your way through the many flavors on your visit Plus I love that they source locally and are conscientious of the environment in their decor and product My first visit I went with a friend and with each sample taste I would try a little and pass the spoon for my friend to try also Then I got a taste of the salted butter caramel ice cream I took my little taste and new instantly that I would order a scoop Quickly a shameful panic swept over me In spite of knowing that I was about to order a whole scoop of this delicious treat I could not bear the thought of parting with the remaining bite I looked to my friend To the woman behind the counter Back to my friend Back to the woman behind the counter Um can she have her own taste of this one Truly that basically sums up Sweet Republics ice cream Its sophisticated flavors like Cheese Course Duo a pairing of Roquefort blue cheese and local Medjool dates or Basil Lime sorbet or the oft referenced Chocolate Rosemary peak your grown up interest and get you through the door  the great taste pushes that grown up aside and brings out the five year old inside of you They even let you chose what type of spoon you want a standard plastic spoon an old fashioned wooden ice cream stick or a tiny little neon colored spoon,positive,260,250-300,1402,1000-1500
Wow Fantastic I got the strawberry shortcake donut and Jim got the vanilla bean donut Then we shared a creme brÃlÃe donut By far the creme brÃlÃe was the best one The cream center is made in house and the crunchy sugar top makes this donut turkey something special The vanilla bean was good so was the strawberry shortcake They are huge but nothing to special Atmosphere is great and the staff are wonderful,positive,74,50-75,420,<500
Called to inform after placing a 65 order that items were missing after leaving the LV strip Person who answered phone was incredibly rude wouldnt tell me her name and asked repeated what she was supposed to do about it got an attitude and then hung up on me My purpose for calling was to inform them that it seemed someone wasnt paying attention when orders were packaged and told her that She grunted Being in the customer service industry myself this response was extremely rude and unprofessional and puts Carlos Bakery to shame,negative,94,75-100,544,500-1000
ordered three crunchy cereal milkshakes and theyre all weird tasting ive had this same milkshake at the milkbar in new york and it definitely did not taste like this the milkshake tastes so salty saltier than salt  vinegar chips just read the recipe online and it says its supposed to be milk cornflakes brown sugar and a pinch of salt pretty sure they replaced the brown sugar with salt and this drink is just milk salt and cornflakes the soft serve with crunchy cereal was also a little salty the milkbar pie was 1010,negative,95,75-100,539,500-1000
The BEST cupcakes in Las Vegas And believe me I have tried cupcakes everywhere in this town The most moist decadent flavorful perfect cupcakes Ive ever had They are actually tied with the cupcakes I had at Magnolia Bakery in NYC I cant pick between the two they are that amazing Vanillavanilla is my favorite you can tell everything there is to tell about a bakery by their vanilla cake and vanilla frosting and Sprinkles does not disappoint in the least Im sorry I dont think they are pricey at all This is the perfect example of you get what you pay for You can tell these are made from scratch daily if not hourly I have yet to try the ice cream but will have to one of my next trips Flavors Tried and Loved them All VanillaVanilla Cupcake Black and White Cupcake Red Velvet  Regular and Vegan Smores Cupcake Pumpkin Cupcake Carrot Cake Cupcake Chocolate Peanut Butter Cupcake ChocolateChocolate Cupcake Strawberry Cupcake,positive,165,150-200,953,500-1000
I have been looking forward to returning to Page Dairy Mart since Ive been seeing it get rave reviews on different sites I finally got that opportunity The first thing I must stress is that they serve soft serve ice cream They do not have any hard ice cream you would find in stores or at different vendors Im usually a fan of the latter but in this case I will make an exception Page dairy mart carries your traditional vanilla chocolate and twist varieties but they have a number of different flavors they can make them in A few of these flavors include black cherry butter pecan birthday cake made with real cake and peanut butter again made with real peanut butter In addition to cones they carry the usual fare which include milkshakes arctic swirls slushes floats etc However there number one selling item is their sundaes Their sundaes come in several different sizes which if you end up with a medium will be about 3 scoops of ice cream and they will add things like brownies cake cinnamon bun or even a cookie One of the two top selling sundaes is the Yinzer which is made with a brownie chocolate chip Heath bar vanilla ice cream topped with hot caramel and whipped cream The other is the cookie sundae which is made with a large warmed chocolate peanut butter chip cookie that comes from Nancy Bs further down in Homestead vanilla ice cream and topped with your choice When I went to order I learned that Nancy Bs is closed this week due to vacation so they did not stock that flavor However they came out with a brand new flavor called burnt almond cake sundae The burnt almond cake comes from Grandview bakery on Mt Washington where I have often frequented and have been very pleased with their baked goods It has a custard filling and they thought to put a small amount of raspberry glaze on it to give it just a touch of flavor Although normally served as medium I asked if they could make it into a smaller size which they did I was aware how huge these portions are You really get more bang for your buck here I was grateful and believe me this was just like eating a burnt almond torte It was so good Page Dairy Mart has been a long standing ice cream stand which is easy to overlook when driving to either Homestead or the Southside Located on E Carson St at the corner of Becks Run Road near Carrick it is probably the best soft serve ice cream you can find in the city Open seasonally A must return,positive,453,300- 500,2472,2000+
Finally got around to trying this place I really thought the ice cream sandwich would have cookies not macaroons I settled for the brownie sandwich with the strawberry shortcake ice cream topped with pecans There was an iPad with photos of different combinations of sandwiches but there were so many I did not have time to look at them all They were also pretty busy Being my first time I was really confused about what to order and wanted more explanations and patience to help me but that area was a little lacking with the service Thy offer a student discount as well I felt really overloaded with sugar because Im not a heavy sweets eater but I do recommend going here because its different and great for people with a sweet tooth,positive,133,100-150,744,500-1000
Great decor and the cupcake ATM is cool but the cupcake is way below average for gourmet cupcakes The cake is sticky and squishy and doesnt peel off the paper well I had to scrape it with a spoon But the part that did come off was too soft and broke apart  The frosting on the other hand is a super dense smear more the consistency of fudge than frosting The 2 textures dont work together Neither had much flavor  I had the black velvet which is supposed to be dark chocolate So for 375 for 3 bites of mushy bland cake and an inedible frosting slab I wont be back,negative,113,100-150,582,500-1000
A wellloved local hangout with a caring staff and great peoplewatching Lots of pastry choices as well as soups salads and sandwiches My only complaint was the mushroom soup was in an excruciatingly salty onion base I was thirsty for the next 2 days Go see this place if only to see how a threebay concrete space can be turned into a charming cafe with creative painting silly but friendly wall decorations and funky painted furniture Open 24 hours,positive,79,75-100,462,<500

Have you las vegans lost your mind How can you even call these macarons These are super dry and stale I havent had macarons like these since Koreans tried to make macarons in their cafÃs I bought a box of 6 huge macarons they looked so perfect Until I bit into one and it burst into a hundred small crumbs all over my jacket Yeah Macarons are definitely not supposed to do that unless they are a week old,negative,79,75-100,422,<500
I used to go twice a week  after being ignored for almost 2 years and referring people from my work  I got tired of the rude attitude from the owner  but spending 20 dollars a week and the only one standing in line for 15 to 18 mins at a time a finally got tired of waiting The ice cream is good but the owners attitude is terrible I stopped going and told my co workers that had the same experience with the ownerI actually gave him another chance not going for 2 years you figure he would say  where have you been  But no he made me wait again for 12 min and I was the only one in line  terrible service IM DONE with this place ,negative,135,100-150,649,500-1000
The nicest thing about this place is just how it looks My partner had the strawberry sundae and I had the kitchen sink sundae and they were completely average We bought a brownie  oatmeal cookie as well and they werent anything better we could have bought at a grocery store If Churn focused on better quality of food instead of trying to be pretty maybe Id be back,negative,69,50-75,373,<500
I was honestly disappointed Maybe I set my expectations high because its Buddy but the pastries were expensive I got the strawberry cheesecake and lobster tail and they were ok The lobster tail was hard and crunchy While the strawberry cheesecake tasted like the ones that you buy at the grocery store,negative,52,50-75,308,<500
I dont like writing a bad review but today I had a bad experience First the young man had attitude After that I asked dont put nuts on my order and of course when I got my order there was nuts on it He wrote it down when I ordered no nutsSecond of all I ordered one scoop from one flavor and one scoop other flavor in a bowl When I got my order I got 2 bowls with 3 scoops in it Im so disappointed We like their ice cream,negative,91,75-100,437,<500
Ive heard on more than one occasion that Sprinkles Cupcakes is just a fad Theyre not that good Just another chain Um Im sorry but if someones says that to you unfriend them You dont need that kind of negativity in your life THESE CUPCAKES WERE TO DIE FOR Moist Fresh Perfect amount of frosting Not to mention pretty to look at I was introduced to these cupcakes by two big burly men That has GOT to say something And the fact you can make a cupcake ice cream sundae is a freakin game changer Excuse me while I locate a Sprinkes location near me like now,positive,107,100-150,579,500-1000
I love ice creamBut NOT their ice cream Kind of greasy with flat flavors I had Hailleys Comet caramel and chocolate swirl and a friend had the cookie dough He didnt like his either I threw about 14 of mine away 364 per scoop Not worth the money or the calories,negative,51,50-75,276,<500
Masons served me the blandest ice cream Ive ever tasted I wanted to like this place Its local seems to be in a great location has a cool vibe and seating and is close to our friends place in Cleveland Their website even shows that they have gained some local notoriety and Alton Brown likes them That would seem to be a recipe for fantastic ice cream The problem was product Hunny and I got two different flavors green tea and Vietnamese coffee Both had an icy texture rather than a creamy texture and both were practically flavorless Hunny said there was only a suggestion of flavor This is a fair criticism based on the two flavors we tried Baskin Robbins is better than what we got that evening Seriously Clearly Masons is doing pretty well in the media which presumably comes from being more hit than miss Im hoping we just got a bad batch On the plus side there are unique everchanging flavors dog treats available for your pups and vegan options for those so inclined The owners seem to be creative and passionate about their craft which I respect no matter what youre serving Id be willing to give Masons a second chance but the ice cream would have to blow my mind next time to get them to four stars I feel like I wasted my money  their product aint cheap,negative,236,200-250,1312,1000-1500
Take a number and be prepared to wait and wait and wait some more So after a 45 min wait I was hoping for amazing cannolis and for the price we paid lets just say I was looking for Buddy himself because I wouldnt have wanted anyone else to have made them However I wound up paying 350 per cannoli for a giant disappoint and the pleasure of waiting 45 min in a small crowded bakery along with a ton of other people who were all crowded in on top of each other so we could try to hear our numbers being called because if you missed your number they werent going to call it again And it wasnt like you could make your selection or look at the case while you were waiting because the people were so crowded into the bakery like sardines that they were all up on the case blocking it from view from everyone When your number was called you had to push your way through just to look at the case to see what they even had but the selection was pretty dismal anyway so it really didnt matter Your choices were cookies mini cheese cakes cannolis chocolate covered strawberries or lobster tails For being such a well known bakery the selection was awful As for the Carlos Bakery amazing cannoli recipe they just average and the cookies were just cookies I will say that the Lobster Tail was pretty good though but I would never wait in that crazy line for another one,negative,260,250-300,1385,1000-1500
My boyfriend and I were so excited about this place because weve heard great things about it We checked it out one Saturday afternoon and I was not impressed The overall appearance seems cool but its quite dirty and dusty I get the gimmick of it coming off vintage but the furniture was worn down and uncomfortable My macaroons werent fresh my boyfriends sandwich was blahand we felt rushed while placing our order Dont think Ill be back there anytime soon if ever,negative,83,75-100,481,<500
Just finished a delicious treat here Me and my husband were first timers and the young man there was so kind and gave us knowledge of the flavors and the business It was nice We definitely recommend Dont be discouraged at first glance its really great here and super friendly,positive,50,25-50,282,<500
My favorite ice cream shop of all time Its a quick 5 minute drive from my house and Ive been coming here since I was a kid My family and I come pretty much every week Their ice cream is so creamy and not overly sugary I get the banana ice cream 98 of the time Its unlike any other The other 2 of the time I get their seasonal flavors my favorite are banana peanut butter shocker triple berry lemon meringue pie and pumpkin caramel ginger snap in the fall Also their orange blossom is perfect for the summertime it tastes like a light creamsicle and Ive never seen this flavor anywhere else My mom loves the red raspberry sundae The have locations all over the Cleveland area but Ive grown up coming to this one,positive,137,100-150,732,500-1000
Came through drippin drip drip Being a big boba tea aficionado I was drawn to their drinks Their strawberry matcha latte is absolutely incredible with homemade strawberry sauce and made on the spot matcha tea It is reminiscent of The Boba Guys in SF Their boba is just the right amount of chewiness which can oftentimes be over cooked or made soggy Ive also tried their matcha latte which is equally as delicious Their ice cream is quite the creative concept where breakfast cereal is melded into the soft serve They have a plethora of cereals you can pick from to create a treat drawing memories from childhood I will definitely be back soon,positive,114,100-150,656,500-1000
Ok I never write a review but I felt compelled to this time My family and I have been on a Master Chef binge watch so when my daughter and I were in Vegas for a couple days we were very excited to go to Milk Bar You how it feels when youre so exited to try something spend a lot of money to do it only to be disappointed Sadly thats the result of our experience Let me start off by saying my daughter dies over birthday cake and its few and far between that we find one she doesnt like so heck yeah Ill spend 15 for a slice of heaven I ordered 2 pieces one for us while there and one to take home to my husband and son It looked beautiful just like the pictures So excited for the first bite but we could barely get our fork through it because it was FROZEN Ok no problem because frozen cake can be good Then the first taste Hmmmm weird Another bite ummm this is not good but we need to take bites of just the frosting and just the cake to figure this out Basically what we figured out is that the frosting tasted like salty cream cheese frosting and the cake tasted as if there was no salt added at all I love the power of salt and even put it in my morning coffee to enhance flavor so to taste the cake that was flavorless because there was no salt mixed with a slightly tangy very salty frosting was very weird Next we tried the birthday cake ice cream because of course we love birthday cake and we get that flavor at every ice cream or frozen yogurt shop when available Again we were sadly disappointed Have you ever tried salty ice cream Im so confused at this because I love salt so its way overboard when it too salty for me Last we tried the milk bar pie aka crack pie While the flavor of this was good the piece was small and again FROZEN All in all Im glad we tried it but wish I wouldve saved my 60 for something else,negative,370,300- 500,1885,1500-2000
Over priced and over hyped Bought a cookie and a strawberry cheesecake and it was 15 The cookie was so dry and the strawberry cheesecake tasted bad that I couldnt even finish it,negative,33,25-50,182,<500
Not a fan I dont understand the menu and I wont respond to it I ended up getting a piece of cake that was meh,negative,25,<50,114,<500
Decided to come here since my coworkers were saying how good it was We were excited to go and try something new We get there and Michele is the cashier  we are asking her questions and she just seemed over her job and gave us attitude We asked her which size was the regular and shes like theyre over there and we look over and there were 3 cups so we still didnt know which one was the regular and at that point we knew she didnt want to help us so we got our order and left The girl who then said shake is ready didnt say what it was and we looked at that counter and shes like yeah here Over all the customer service was not great,negative,131,100-150,653,500-1000
This review is for the Chocolate Cupcake only This cupcake is as good as it gets I would say Bouchon Bakerys chocolate cupcake is even better than Karas and Sprinkles Cupcakes The meringue frosting is lighter than traditional buttercreamicing The chocolate cream and the cake itself is moist and has a rich yet not too sweet taste 350 for a BIG cupcake,positive,62,50-75,366,<500
Super cute super friendly staff Unique looking and large in size donuts do you get your monies worth However some were lacking in flavor For example the Nutella was basically just like a chocolate glazed It was good though We also felt rushed and pushed down the line I felt like i didnt even get to look at all the choices because of that If you want to sit and eat there they do have seating outside I loved the outside sitting area Very cute and peaceful,positive,87,75-100,473,<500
Today I had the honor of trying the macaronschocolate and vanilla First bite of vanilla chewy and SWEET Second bite of vanilla mmmm the outside is crispy and the amount of almond in it is just right Third bite of vanilla i guess the buttercream is a little too much for me Onto the chocolate  LOVE IT Definitely not overthetop sweet like the vanilla flavor,positive,66,50-75,375,<500
After reading all the great reviews I decided to try out the Donut Bar I drove from CA to NV for a family trip and picked up a few boxes for the entire family I was so excited to try the donuts but was disappointed with the freshness The cake and yeast donuts were both dry and unimpressive They may have been having an off day and I could have explained it away if only a couple donuts were dry but all the donuts tasted like they had been made the previous day Ive had much better donuts,negative,98,75-100,501,500-1000
They were pretty much out of everything I wanted Out of brownies cookies espressocoffee ice cream,negative,16,<50,102,<500
Best ice cream in Cleveland hands down Homemade in Cleveland TONS of flavors including seasonal flavors and lots of locations in the Cleveland metro area The workers are all friendly and happy to help you They will give you as many samples as you ask for and trust me with so many flavors you will want to try various samples to help you make your decision I love that they offer a tasters duo and tasters trio which allows you to order two duo or three trio different flavors without having to get full scoops of each flavor I usually go for the tasters trio so that I can get my usual Caramel Fudge Brownie  2 seasonal flavors that are rotating on the menu at the time If youre in the Cleveland area go get some Mitchells ice cream You will be so happy you did,positive,147,100-150,794,500-1000
Just like Fauchon in Paris France not the hotel in Vegas Bouchon in Vegas has proven itself to me the companys true understanding of fine bakerypatisserie It could be as simple as a plain croissant and a cup of coffee They know how to do it right The meltinyourmouth texture of the croissant had me go back to Bouchon twice within the span of 3 hours THAT good yes Also props to its convenient location  just at the entrance to the adjoining Sands Expo Center A great quick stop to start off your full day at the conferenceconventionetc with a lovely breakfast Also great for snacks and quick grabandgo lunch fixes Now I just need to fly out to Paris to revisit the exquisite Fauchon,positive,126,100-150,716,500-1000
I absolutely loved my first experience at Sweet Republic and am already looking for reasons to go back I believe I will start taking all of my friends one at a time this means many more trips for me I loved the customer service the flavors and the passion that they clearly have for creating wonderful flavor combinations Choosing was the hardest part I was only able to decide on what to have after I consoled myself with the knowledge that I would be back soon and could have something different,positive,91,75-100,507,500-1000
Love their cupcakes Glad they finally came to Las Vegas Weve had them in Georgetown Washington DC and loved them Great location at The Linq A must have while at The Linq Now if we could get another location maybe the Summerlin area for us locals so we dont have to go to the strip that would be great,positive,59,50-75,315,<500
Ive never had a slice of cake more moist and delicious in my life Already craving another slice and extremely sad that its not in arms reach I tried the funfetti cake and the double chocolate cake and would highly recommend either  along with literally anything in the shop because it all looks and smells to die for,positive,59,50-75,323,<500
I have never been here before and I have to say it was one of the worst customer service experiences Ive had First off none of the donuts are labeled and when I asked an employee to walk me through the flavors she responded just point and Ill tell you Quite rudely Second while I was at the counter deciding on what donuts I wanted a customer shoved by me to get to the register saying Excuse you Also very rude Third I picked two donuts with vanilla icing and vanilla frosting The employee gave me two donuts with maple frosting I asked if the icing was vanilla and she assured me it was vanilla What if you are allergic to maple You would get sick because of the employees lazy attitude All in all the employees are rude and not helpful there is no flavor menu and half of the donuts are not even fresh at 9am I will not be coming back here again Im going to Krispy Kreme or Spudnuts from now on They have better prices and better donuts I suggest you do the same,negative,189,150-200,1001,1000-1500
Having been told just yesterday about Batch and the fact that they make different types of fougasse breads I raced over today to try them out I am a sucker for great fougasse and try them out whenever I see them at a bakery The trouble is they are not always so good Alas the Madison fougasse lived up to my fears Having created something more like a pizza crust in the shape of a pretzel the Batch Bakehouse would be better advised to stick with less ambitious treats like the sinful Hello Dolly 7layer bar Though of course I DID manage to consume this roasted garlicsundried tomatorosemary pretzel in disguise it was heavy and way too chewy not achieving the standard of firm exterior but soft interior,negative,128,100-150,727,500-1000
maybe the pastries are good but the service is shit the coffee sucks and the service is shit and its in the middle of nowhere,negative,25,<50,128,<500
Really disappointed Waited for awhile paid 900 for a piece of cake that was just OK Nothing special about the taste at all It was pretty I ordered the rainbow cake but Ive had better cake from the local grocery store Probably will never go back,negative,46,25-50,256,<500
Ive only had their macarons and I already love this place They are so big and chewy I love it when macarons have a chewy texture instead of being too soft My favorite flavors are vanilla coffee and the salted caramel Definitely worth trying,positive,44,25-50,248,<500
Stale semifrozen cake uhhhh Really This is what people have been raving about The macaron are tasty A couple of the tarts were passable although the crusts were very tough and too chewy Soup is good Go for the atmosphere but dont go hungry,negative,44,25-50,254,<500
Let me start with the positives This shop has a great vibe to it and the family seems passionate about it The young employees always bust their behinds running in such a small space so fluently tackling the long lines They also have an endless menu board of various food and treats The prices are reasonable Now for the reason for two stars The ice cream is absolutely terrible I have had three very different items off the menu over a three year period desperately trying to figure out the hype and find something good Im sorry but everything was downright awful The third and final attempt I had such high hopes but despite how great my sundae looked half of it ended up in the trash My bf also tossed his Not only was it tasteless and disappointing even the brownie and cookie were terrible 33 times Ive been there it upset my stomach Mind you I eat ice cream almost every single day and have been to over 30 shops and never had a problem In fact my bf myself and even my dog all had audibly gurgling stomachs soon after consumption Im sorry but the hype is just unreal to me This ranks 33 of 33 places Ive gotten ice cream I believe the hype is pure nostalgia from people that grew up going there addicted to the memories and passing tradition on not because its actually fantastic There are reasons to love it but if youre going to an ice cream shop for the ice cream you may be greatly disappointed If you care about covid I drove past twice a week and there was never any social distancing last yeargiant crowds all bundled together in line and not many customers wore masks Its as if a pandemic wasnt going on,negative,305,300- 500,1676,1500-2000
The atmosphere is so unique and definitely a really cool place to go for a meetup study session or coffee BUT I do have to admit the pastries are so overrated They are often stale and just not as good as I would expect,negative,44,25-50,221,<500
My family took me here Im from out of town and this ice cream makes me want to come back to phoenix It tasted so fresh and decadent I had the peanut butter mixed with the coffee It was definitely the best coffee ice cream I have ever tasted There is a small seating area in the back too,positive,59,50-75,294,<500
I dont know if the bakery is still on soft opening we were there on New Year and of course a line outside and a line inside slowly moving and we finally pick up our tray and made our choices and made it to the cashier heres the verdict its not worth the standing in line I will go back to Red Ribbon maybe after three months I will give it a try again thumbs down for now,negative,78,75-100,382,<500
Lots of mention of lines in previous reviews but there were only a few people there when I went It was midday midweek I got two linzers and a cannoli I havent tried the linzer yet but the cannoli wow Best Ive had in years Might even give nonna a run for her money shhhhhh,positive,55,50-75,283,<500
Maybe it was just the flavor I chose Vanilla but it was the most bland no flavor cupcake I have ever had My friend had coconut lemon and liked hers Doubt I will be back but I can say I have been and tried it,negative,45,25-50,210,<500
This place is a gem first of all We needed something to save our disappointing lunch My wife is a celiac but she is willing to get sick over good desserts Shes a maniac The menu is decadent and plenty for everyone and when I say everyone I mean celiacs Taking a look at the menu we found that there were actual Gluten Free options With cereals and cakes and cookies everywhere they actually thought of the Celiacs That alone is 5 star worthy I was looking forward to have an apple fritter sandwich and was disappointed to hear it was a temporary item Trust me if they make that permanent item I will be a permanent weekly customer I settled for the warm donut with apple pie ice cream topped with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal It was awesome My wife picked the macaroon ice cream sandwich with cotton candy ice cream topped with gummy bears She loved it Only problem Its too far from our house We will definitely be back when in the area,positive,176,150-200,968,500-1000
So sad Not Worth the extremely long wait They sold me 3 drinks 2 large boxes and one bag However after waiting in a long line I had to wait again which I didnt mind if I would have received all 3 drinks Nope they said the ran out of stuff to make it 2 of them Asked for them to refund me for 2 drinks They took my card and Im still waiting for the money This is not like the one in California So sad I wish it was,negative,91,75-100,427,<500
I seriously do not understand what the hype is all about I got the super hyped milk and cereal cornflakes soft serve and it was the saltiest ice cream I have ever tasted and the fact that the owner is a Master Chef judge I dont know how I feel It was so ughhh thats my first reaction when I tasted it It was not even really sweet at all just all salt even when I just eat the ice cream part It made me so dehydrated lol Maybe I just dont have a refined enough platelet for things like this I also bought their compost cookies which were good but also salty lol it has coffee bits in it which I like and make it sweeter but the cookie itself was also on the salty side I also tried the cornflakes and marshmallows which once again salty af The chocolate cookie was also salty more than sweet so I really dont know how to feel about this place Its either my tongue is broken or this place just full of saltttttttt Overall Taste 25 Service 45 Parking 35  garage parking of the hotel Price 25 not worth it,negative,200,150-200,1026,1000-1500
As others have stated there is no clear sign to let you know your in the right place Its located inside of something that looks like a warehouse with terrible parking I ordered the peach cobbler Lets just say if you prefer unseasoned chicken you might love it It was luke warm if that and it had no taste If youve have good peach cobbleryou know what I mean You taste the cinnamon etc this tasted like nothing Your better off getting a frozen Mrs Smith cobbler from food lion The ice cream is about 2 tablespoons nothing like the pictures,negative,101,100-150,560,500-1000
Thee best ice cream and waffle chips Ive ever had I see why the line is always so insane We luckily missed the long line but Id probably wait in it next time anyway Delicious,positive,35,25-50,182,<500
There was a line to get ice cream but I can understand why The smell alone was so appetizing I went with the dairy free options Cold brew with coconut cream and Texas sheet cake on a sugar cone The cold brew was my favorite but gosh it was delicious,positive,50,25-50,254,<500
This review is based on the kouign mannI came here for croissant and i stumbled upon the display of Kouign amann OMGOMG I bought 4 It was like honey and crispy on the outside and super flaky on the inside I think its rare to stumble upo Kouign amann for its not widely made in most bakeries The macaroon didnt look too pleasant,positive,63,50-75,341,<500
Get there right before closing time and there was a line staff was friendly and I was allowed to taste different unusual flavors like blue cheese and jalapeno avocado but stayed with a save one Belgium chocolate that was amazing and the sugar cone waffle was the freshest,positive,48,25-50,277,<500
wasnt up to the hype or the line actually not a fan of the smell or taste if the buckwheat crepe you may like it but it had a weird smell hard to eat out of the fancy cute box they provide i ordered the CBC or chicken and bacon crepe my two friends also ordered  so 3 total crepes after i paid she proceeded to tell me they were out of chicken i said well had i known that i woildnt have ordered and paid for CBC which has a main ingredient CHICKEN lol anyway she looked dismayed when i said well can you just cancel mine and just make the other two that my friends ordered well she seemed annoyed so swapped out some other meat and then my friends were served their crepes in about 10 minutes while i waited for literally 20 minutes for mine to get done all while my friends waited you do what you want this will not be a stand i ever buy from again  my visit was saturday in sept 2021,negative,182,150-200,907,500-1000

I love Sprinkles but the Las Vegas location did not live up to my Sprinkles expectations The Newport Beach location is much better and their cupcakes taste fresh These ones were as cold as an ice cube ,negative,38,25-50,206,<500
I love Birthday cake and when I heard of this place I was so excited to try their birthday cake I was not impressed by it Way too sweet on the frosting and the cake was dry Was so disappointed I was hoping it was going to be very moist and not so sweet Cake I give one start my husband had the crack pie soft serve and he said it was good Thats the reason for the two star I seriously dont see what all the hype is all about Sorry Milk bar disappointed,negative,95,75-100,462,<500
Used to be a wonderful place Went there recently and it has gone downhill Grungy environment dirty tables and floors staff was rude when we got to checkout we decided to add one more pastry and the employee gave attitude All of this would be excusable if the food was great My breakfast sandwich was dry and had no flavor The macaron was chewy and dry Very disappointing I will be trying the new petit macaron shop next time,negative,79,75-100,436,<500
I would give them five stars but the turtle sundae at honey hut is better But its still a good place,positive,21,<50,103,<500
So I started following this page on instagram after randomly maybe not so random seeing one of the shakes on my explore page Even though it is not in my neighborhood I do travel to the neighborhood its in often So finally I took the time to stop by on a Saturday evening Even though it was Saturday its not exactly warm yet so I wasnt sure what to expect in terms of wait time Im pleased to say even though there was a little line the wait time was less than 5 minutes This shop is known for its ice cream sandwiches and shakes I opted for the Bottom of the Bowl Shake This one was included whatever cereal topping you want They do have a variety of cereals but I decided to go with crunch berries When I tell you it was one of the best shakes Ive ever had its no exaggeration I loved every minute of it including the edible rim on the cup Might I add its a pretty photogenic shake too I finished it in a few minutes along with the edible rim which I believe to be frosting with crushed cereal pieces My son got a regular cup of ice cream which he also enjoyed I cant wait to come back in the warmer months and try another flavor Or another item all together,positive,231,200-250,1187,1000-1500
My fam and I are huge fans of the show have been since the beginning Needless to say when we heard Buddy was opening up shop in LV we were stoked and could not wait to finally try some of the yummy treats we had seen on the show Sadly we were highly disappointed  twice We decided to get my father a Canoli cake for his birthday this year 61814  the big 66 retirement at last too bad it could not be a memorable one where his cake took center stage The cake is very different looking from the pics on the website which I guess only apply to the Hoboken location There were no almond slivers around the cake the cream was kind of heavy and very bland on the upside the vanilla sponge was ok just sad that all together it was not good We also had the mini canoli original and chocolate my daughters thought they were ok  nothing special I had the Napoleon this was the WORST thing I have ever put in my mouth in the disguise of a dessert The French cream was hard and you could tell had been sitting around for a while the flaky pastry layers were more like thin sheets of cardboard they were tough and hard to bite through I almost broke a tooth trying to bite through it after a couple attempts the Napoleon was totally destroyed and looked like a firecracker went off in it  for sure had been sitting around for a while Lastly the lines are redonkulous We waited for over an hour and a half on a Sat night and it was so wrong to see the favoritism on behalf of the young chubby white guy who was at the door letting people in We saw him let in 2 pretty young ladies  totally bypassed the line and walked right in about 20 minutes later he did it again with a punk rocker tattooed pierced pink haired one side the other shaved girl Maybe he feared this one  LOL So sorry Buddy we really did want to love your desserts but hopefully you can make the necessary changes to save this place We will for sure try it again in the future with hopes that the third time is a charm fingerscrossed bringthejumbocrumbcaketoLV,negative,395,300- 500,2072,2000+
One of my absolute favorite laces on Charlotte The potato and leek soup is amazing especially when paired with the croque Monsieur Open 24 hours a dayone of the only places in the area that does this which is a major plus if youre a night owl  staff is friendly all the food and desserts are goodsimply put this place rocks,positive,62,50-75,335,<500
Cute place but expensive The cookies we purchased were not worth the cost Also there were kids trying to do headstands on the couch who kicked a glass bottle of fancy candy onto the floor while we were looking at them Luckily it didnt break but we picked it up Mom was too busy shopping and it was irritating and we left without buying anything else BaristaCashier didnt speak or acknowledge anything Not a very welcoming atmosphere,negative,77,75-100,446,<500
I came to Churn extremely excited and with high expectations because the folks who own Postinos also own Churn First off the parking is poor depending on the time of day and day of the week you go so be prepared Inside while tiny is decorated absolutely amazing It is just like an old time ice cream parlor with a bit of modern flair cute as can be Nostalgic toys and candy from my childhood lined the shelves by the register Antiqueappearing cake stands held other goodies behind the counter Just lovely and so fun to look around Then to the not so lovely part the ice cream itself The texture of the ice cream was icy and tasted flavorless and dry I even sampled several other flavors before making my purchase which I frankly bought to be polite all the same problem I dont think you need to be an ice cream snob to notice that the quality flavor texture etc is simply not good As I like to say A for effort D for execution,negative,177,150-200,966,500-1000
Homemade local honest ice cream This place is super cute and the staff is always very friendly There is an assortment of older style candy brining in a nice retrovintageesque to your visit The ice cream is always superb as is their award winning salted caramel topping Rich thick drizzleneed I say more There is limited parking but plenty nearby I think we can all handle walking a block for ice cream  And if not have someone run in and grab it There is no indoor seating just outside in front and in back If you appreciate local charm and are looking for some great ice cream shakes malts or cookies make a pit stop at Churn Ps Butter Pecan  salted caramel topping is one of my favs,positive,130,100-150,721,500-1000
Very poorly done and visually unattractive I was beyond excited to hear that there was a Carlos bakery at the Venetian We went out of our way to visit and was quickly disappointed The long line outside the bakery was awkward as it was broken in two and cordoned by rope to make room for bathroom users Across the way from the bakery was a Buddys restaurant that was mostly empty We thought to come by after dinner for a shorter line The second time we returned the line was slightly shorter and was creeping along slowly The bakery itself is claustrophobic and the front display case faces to the side You cant easily view the pastries while waiting I took a peek inside the cases and the cakes and pastries looked average nothing that you would expect after watching the show We ended up ditching the bakery without buying anything and we wont return A gigantic waste of our time No excuse for the Venetian to build another restaurant rather than use the ample space to build the bakery as it should,negative,183,150-200,1019,1000-1500
So disappointed The chocolate chocolate chip cookie was underwhelming The Milk Bar pie soft serve was one note at best Christina Tosi should be embarrassed by the lack of quality of the desserts and unfriendly service at Milk Bar Las Vegas,negative,41,25-50,244,<500

Worst customer service I have ever recieved The attitude from the clerk was disgusting from the moment my number was called I brought in 14 people and spent 40 yet I was made to feel like the biggest pain in her butt all day When I addressed her attitude she offered to comp my 12 worth of pastry I told her no I didnt want any discounts just asked her to please watch her attitude it effects us all during the holidays her condescending response was my patronage will be missed when I asked to speak with the manager the clerks all laughed Avoid this bakery at all costs go to Corbos Its the only one Ill go to from now on,negative,122,100-150,641,500-1000
This place is terrible Today I ordered a bubble milk tea and they only gave me ONE bubble On top of that the cup was only half full The little bit I got was mediocre at best as well Im not sure why this place is so popular and honestly I think campustown is better off without these cheats Caffe Paradiso and Espresso Royale aroUnd the corner are much much better,negative,71,50-75,373,<500
Im sorry buddy I can only hope this gets to you and you take this seriously Please go to shop in vegas and try everything My grocery store publix blows your carrot cake I bout butter cookies to take to my kids and I threw them away as soon as I tasted them  bland with no butter taste Its hard to accept criticism but I truly believe I am doing you a service If you dont do anything to change you will see that no matter how much you are on tv customers will stop coming If you need help Im happy to assist,negative,105,100-150,519,500-1000
it was SO overpriced the pasties were good but honestly wayyyyyyy too expensive friendly servers but againunnecessarily expensive probably will never come back because of how expensive it is however the lobster tails were yummy,negative,35,25-50,236,<500
Time has passed this place by I used to crave stopping here every time I was back in town This visit after a 2 year  gap I went back on a Friday night Oops It was 1006 so they were closed  the parking lot was full and there was a line at the windows but it was past closing so NO CUSTARD FOR YOU On Saturday afternoon they were open so I ordered a one scoop waffle cone and thats what I got for 2  a small round ball of chocolate custard sunken way down in a large waffle cone Since Culvers has opened up where I live I now have a comparison and Jarlings is no better on the basic flavors When Culvers has a special flavor  say Black Forest Tort there is no comparison As I said the time has passed them by and all they sell is a bit pricey nostalgia A Shame,negative,160,150-200,793,500-1000
We decided to stop into Amelies once lunchtime rolled around It was a simple enough decision Hey were here and this place sounds nice We just had no idea what a perfect cafÃ experience it would be Their pastry options were topnotch and their lunch options while somewhat limited were fantastic I enjoyed a crocque monsieur sandwich with a cup of carrot ginger wild rice soup Both were delicious but I was particularly impressed by how crammed full of its named contents the soup was There was even a surprise sprinkle of pecan pieces on top Each spoonful was positively heaping with items from the first spoonful to the last We ordered an assortment of mini deserts after lunch Their pecan tart was one of the most delicious things Ive ever eaten and their pumpkin mousse tart was perfect on every level texture temperature flavor balance spice The cafÃ was very large exceptionally clean and full of various antique seating options There are toile curtains and lamp shades and chandeliers everywhere There is an entire wall of needlepoint replicas of famous works of art The walls are a lovely powder blue providing a wonderful backdrop to the bright airy cafÃ DÃcor is whimsical and fun It is unmistakably French but with a sense of humor Shockingly this cafÃ is open 247365 There is free wifi for all you laptop addicts though I highly recommend coming here with someone you can stand to have a conversation with and chatting for a while Honor the French cafÃ spirit,positive,256,250-300,1524,1500-2000
I bought two pints of this from whole foods today and I just read the ingredients list They use corn syrup in their products This is a disgrace I cant believe Whole Foods sells your products I will never buy this again Why wouldnt you use cane sugar I am throwing this away and telling whole foods to stop selling your product,negative,62,50-75,338,<500
Of course Amelies cant go with out a review from a Charlotte denizen But I wont sugar coat this either pun so intended Amelies has some great sandwich and bread choices I like to say that anything on a croissant cant disappoint I tend to go for the teas because Im not a coffee drinker so I cant attest to its quality As for the sweets Ive not always been so happy with them Some of the more outrageous ones with lots of extras attached are overdoing it in my opinion And the expensive colorful truffles are not worth it I guess thats why the case seems to always be full of them Go for the breads or sandwiches and get the white tea The atmosphere and layout along with all the kitschy vintage furniture that looks like it couldve come out of anywhere from your grandmas storage shed to Rococo era France is great for mood setting Then theres the courtyard in the back with all the trees and the skylights This place is always moving always has people and is always surprisingly quite relaxed 247,positive,187,150-200,1026,1000-1500
Sorely disappointed The hot fudge sundae was lukewarm at best and turned my stomach upside down We tried to non pareils and the box didnt close and the woman at the front was flippant about it when we asked for a different one which she didnt and just stuck a sticker on it And the box still didnt workThey havent had brownies for 2 weeks but no where did they have a sign which indicated that Only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one is that I like Ghirardelli chocolate but rest of the experience was subpar I realize places are understaffed and it must be a challenge to find good employees,negative,113,100-150,605,500-1000
Most disappointing experience Ive ever had at a bakery The service was exceptionally terrible we were greeted by you have to leave by 11 oclock in a very snarky and rude manner We ordered the chocolate chip cookie lavender cake chocolate mocha cake and a poppy rose cake As a person with a sweet tooth first time in my life none of the dessert items were remotely flavorful or good Was excited given the hype around the sweets The cake was dense and the icing was not soft the chocolate chip cookie was cold all around bad experience Maybe it was an off day and later in the evening 10ish however I will not be coming back If I could give a 0 star review I would,negative,127,100-150,684,500-1000

Cheat meal wasted I have this pet peeve I absolutely hate it when a place is highly rated on my beloved Yelp or even culturally in general only to find out that it was for novelty over actual superiority Its like someone hooking you up with someone sexy and you get all excited because they look good in the pictures but you meet them in person and they have no personality Thats donut bar I waited like months to try this place because I try to eat healthy most of the time I drooled over the photos of the strawberry poppa tart the creme brÃlÃe donut etc I walked in and saw that Brad fritter and got one of those too on good faith even though I dont even like apple in baked goods Because this place has a lot of stars so its GOTTA BE GOOD Right And after an extra strenuous workout to prep for the big day I finally got to try all of the donuts I had been pining over And none of them rocked my world Not one I get there and the shop is cute clean very nice displays and an absolutely wonderful staff To my surprise the donuts are even waaaaaaay bigger than pictures communicate My as was EXCITED I got a strawberry poppa tart creme brÃlÃe donut Brad fritter Nutella glaze and birthday cake glaze and not a single one of them was worthy of more than 2 stars They are big and fluffy but they catered more to having giant donuts than delicious ones Something about the actual donut bodies themselves were just plain and boring and they topped them with glazes  toppings that will get you all exited but are ultimately lackluster as well Except the candied bacon on the Brad fritter Best part of the whole donut box was that bacon That wound up being my breakfast Do yourself a favor and head on over to Master Donuts on the eastside or RONALDS DONUTS in China town Theyre the change yo lyfe type of good donuts Trust,negative,349,300- 500,1876,1500-2000
So doughnuts are one of my favorite foods and though Im not vegan I prefer it if its available This place does not disappoint and I struggle not to come here every week Always a friendly staff super cute but simple interior take out only All the focus on the doughnuts Strawberry shortcake is one of my favorites as well as the lemon lavender Its really hard to get only two I also had the Boston cream,positive,77,75-100,418,<500
Pro gluten pro Batch If you go in with intentions to only purchase a baguette remember that at least those intentions were good when you walk out carrying the baguette a brownie two Russian tea cakes and a dark chocolate honey pecan tart Oh thats just me Cool Went to their new location for the first time today Mom by my side and picked up a Monkey Bread Bun and Jordandal Farms Ham  Gruyere Croissant As we checked out my Mom told the cashier that she looked like a prettier Lindsay Lohan aka a premeth Lindsay Lohan The cashier took it as a compliment her freckles lit up and we went off into the bitter cold Madison springtime with our treasures The croissant was buttery cheesy and meaty which basically makes it God among men of the croissant world The Monkey Bread pulled apart and popped into my mouth without hesitation If youre gonna go with a sweet treat go with their salted caramel brownies And die happy,positive,169,150-200,953,500-1000
Was excited to try this but the excitement soon waned I purchased a slice of crack pie for like 67 Well if thats a slice Id sure hate to see their version of a sliver because thats what it really was For that price you should get a generous slice It was okay kinda like cold pecan pie without the pecans I asked for it alamode but was told that wasnt an option so I purchased a small ice cream of chocolate covered pretzel and cereal milk for another 67 I might add Consistency was good but there was virtually no flavor I tasted salt in the chocolate but really no chocolate So I give them A for marketing and C for their product Great marketing can make anything look good  beware ,negative,134,100-150,708,500-1000
I was not impressed with the Donut Bar The French toast donut and latte I got were pretty good but everything else I tried was flavourless Like a lot of other reviews mentioned the sugar topping on the creme brÃlÃe donut was way too thick the red velvet donut was very dry and didnt taste like anything and the Nutella donut was less dry but still had almost no flavour,negative,70,50-75,379,<500

Ordered a 135 cake from here for a big event on Monday and was expecting it to get to the event on Saturday then got an email saying it wouldnt get there until the following day I would expect a big and famous chain bakery to be competant enough to have my cake the day I ordered it for Highly disappointed and now I dont know what to do because the I ordered the cake to arrive where the event was held and wont be able to get it when it arrives Beware and do NOT order from this bakery ZERO stars Update The cake didnt get arrive until 3 days after it was expected ,negative,115,100-150,577,500-1000

Horrible service I went in with my husband to get a sundae and wanted to use a coupon for Fathers Day weekend It clearly says for the weekend When I went to use it is only valid Saturday and Sunday Really it is Friday night and you wont honor it Their ice cream is not that good and there was maybe 3 people in the storeCustomer service is something theu really need to work on,negative,75,50-75,386,<500
My family and I were so trill to see the cake boss bakery in Las Vegas until we had their pasties  My sis and I had the cannoli the cream tasted grainy and chalky and of course they were soggy My husband had the napoleon the custard was pure corn starch it needed vanilla flavor or milk or something My niece had the cheesecake and that was actually good because of the cheesecake Im giving them one star Changes are I will never come back again,negative,87,75-100,454,<500
I wish I could give this place a lower star I was visiting Vegas for a work thing and we decided we wanted to get a cake for someones birthday and figured lets do Carlos because its located in the same place we were staying and having watched the Cake Boss for a while I was interested to taste the flavors We called in a cake to be picked up the next day got a chocolate cake that said happy birthday on it it was supposed to feed 20 So I show up about half an  on September 9th at 430pm hour after the pick up time to grab my cake and hop into the pickup line Probably wait 1520 minutes until Im next in line I am about to talk to the cashier girl when she calls out a name  which she wasnt doing before and this girl behind me jumps out and goes and talks to the cashier and pays for her food Im like what just happened I am about to talk to the cashier girl when she calls another person Ashley and before Ashley cuts me I go up to the girl and I explain that I am not Ashley but I have a cake that should be ready that I need to pick up  at this point Im running short on time as I didnt assume it would take an hour The girl is all like oh Ill have to get someone else to do that and then proceeds to say it is going to be 20 to which I was surprised and was like I thought it was more and she goes are you Ashley And Im like no  I already explained whats going on Anyways she doesnt say anything else she just calls out the Ashley name again and Ashley pops over and pays for her food and the cashier continues to ignore me Im like getting real annoyed at this point because the lady isnt even acknowledging me Eventually she goes and gets some else to grab my food and I wait another 15 minutes for this guy to come back which in this time the people behind me are asking if Im in line for pickup because cashier girl is completely ignoring the line and this point and just calling people willy nilly Eventually I get my cake when I ask for a knife to cut it all they have is a tiny plastic butter knife and when i ask for my receipt they give me a frosting covered piece of paper I wouldnt be this annoyed except the cake was over 70 and tasted like a generic sheet cake you can get from your local grocery store  majority of the cake was bad frosting  Moral of the story these guys suck and Im sure the cake bosss store is just a front for money laundering because I have no idea how they are still in business otherwise,negative,503,500+,2488,2000+
Food is quite good So why only two stars The management is so pretensions When my daughter and I circled the room two times with plates and drink in hand and couldnt find anywhere to sit I asked the management if they were going to open the room that was roped off since they were so busy I didnt understand that it was a private rental only space There were no signs Her response was Well it is normally rented for 100 an hour but I guess since you need someplace to sit we will open it just for YOU  Seriously And they are constantly in the news for their horrible practices in dealing with the back of the house employees Like requiring them to work 60 hrs a week but having them clock out after 40 and then back in under another title so that they wont have to pay time and a half I have spoken with some x employees that have confirmed that and worse So the food is decent though crazy expensive and the ambiance is frilly and french But dont think that you are supporting a positive local business I can do without the salted caramel brownies to sleep better at night,negative,208,200-250,1104,1000-1500
Horrible And this place was on Cake Boss not worthy of the line you have to wait in to try pastries that taste like they are store bought Ive had fresher tasting pastries at the local Starbucks The celebrity status has most definitely gotten to the heads of the management at this bakery 10 for a personal cheesecake that doesnt taste like anything and the cannoli  OMG what a disaster the cannoli tastes like you are biting into gritty sugary whip cream with a shell that seems to have been made days ago not fresh at all Try a local bakery instead they put more love into what they are serving versus theCake Boss who obviously is only after the dollars My family and I will not be back to this place guaranteed Dont waste your time or your money,negative,141,100-150,787,500-1000

Ive been reading all the rave reviews about this place Went there around 10am Our donuts were awful The glazefrosting on the tops were so dried out It seemed like the donuts had been out since the day before My husband ordered the maple bacon The bacon in top wasnt even cooked all the way The fat wasnt even rendered out of it The maple was so dry it was cracked and caked off Disappointing after reading how amazing it was,negative,81,75-100,438,<500
I know the shop is new and Im sure its busy all day but the two girls who helped me made my experience bad In general the staff is not organized at all My friend requested rocky road and when we were waiting for our ice cream after paying already the girl who was helping us told the customer after us that there was only one scoop of rocky road left and she had to choose a second scoop of another flavor My friend went up to the employee and asked how did you skip me when I ordered rocky road but now you served it to a customer who ordered after me I also ordered roasted almonds on my ice cream and when I got my cone it was peanuts I asked that same employee if they were peanuts and she rudely replied NO they are almonds I let my friends taste my cone and it was peanuts I know what peanuts taste like Just the overall experience was disappointing,negative,171,150-200,885,500-1000
Best ice cream in town They always have new and unique flavors every time I stop in The staff is very friendly and let you try as many flavors as you want But the cookie cup is by far my favorite You choose a macaroon bottom as many scoops of delicious ice cream in the middle and another macaroon on top I usually top mine with a toasted marshmallow I highly recommend this ice cream shop,positive,76,75-100,399,<500

Not Impressed We got a wedge of pecan pie a chocolate dipped cheesecake a cookie and cream cupcake and a slice of rainbow buttercream cake The pecan pie was the only thing with good flavor The chocolate dipped cheesecake was mediocre The cookie and cream cupcake was a slightly dry underflavored chocolate cupcake with some gritty speckled frosting on top that tasted nothing like cookies and cream The rainbow cake was equally flavorless and unimpressive Im honestly pretty upset with the inflated prices we paid for underwhelming bakery goods Dont get lured in by the Carlos name and Buddys face everywhere You can get a better cake out of a box at the store for 2 and save yourself 20 The only reason this isnt a one star review is because the staff were great,negative,135,100-150,782,500-1000
Bouchon I finally found you Ive been to Vegas how many times and I always seem to miss your macarons I made it a point to find you this past trip You offer expensive baked goods but the macaron variety pack is well worth the trip to the Venetian I paid 1750 for 6 macarons lemon orange strawberry chocolate coffee and vanilla My favorite was the lemon one  very refreshing These macarons are huge  bigger than most macarons Ive seen from other places Unfortunately they didnt travel well These are delicate cookies that almost didnt survive the heat and the flight But I got them home and the edges were crumbly and the creamy filling had partially melted But still they tasted good The case with the baked goods looked tempting  I would have gotten one of each if I had the space in my suitcase,positive,149,100-150,825,500-1000
I tried a samplebefore noticing that the associate working had her long straight hair hanging loose over the open tubs of ice cream She held it outofthe way with her bare hands which she was also using to scoop I was amazed that the families that were present actually went ahead and purchased food I didnt buy because I was too creeped out I walked past again a few minutes later and she was repeatedly running her hand through it Yikes,negative,81,75-100,448,<500

I could not check in here because my phone ran out of batteries but I had to write a review This place was AWESOME So many different varieties of popcorn flavors to choose from Plus you get a chance to sample a few different flavors too Always a good thing They also have many other sweets like chocolate covered oreos etc In addition to buying popcorn my wife and I also picked up a cupcake It was very good Im thinking  Christmas gifts for my neices and nephews,positive,89,75-100,484,<500
I love doughnuts and am a doughnut aficionado but these are not good in my opinion Theyre too dense too one note flavored and lack good dough to icing ratio They didnt taste very fresh on the morning 10am I was there and I feel like doughnuts should always taste fresh before lunchtime Theyre not the worst doughnuts Ive ever had but arent worth their price tag and isnt worth a special trip Ive had far better doughnuts in Las Vegas like Real Doughnuts on Charleston and Rons on Spring Mountain,negative,91,75-100,518,500-1000
Disgusting ice cream It was the worst Ive ever had Peanut butter ice cream tasted like salt The cereal milk was slightly better We didnt finish our cup It was way too soft serve The next day we got Ben and Jerrys and it was phenomenal Dont waste your time at the milk bar it was awful,negative,57,50-75,296,<500
Super disappointing I have been hearing about Milk for years from a blogger in NYC who raves about it Not sure if its different in NYC but in Vegas everything was prepackaged I thought it would be like a high end bakery but instead I felt like I was getting over priced and not very good convenience store snacks,negative,59,50-75,319,<500

OkI was so exited to try products from Christina since I watch her on Master chef and she is master bakerI was totally disappointed in her compost cookie had no flavor and her milk shake with crunch they were both totally underwhelming I was in the Vegas Milk The next day I went to the Hershey Store and had there Kit Kat chocolate chip cookie now thats a cookie Needless to say I wont be going back to Milk,negative,79,75-100,423,<500
Stopped by here for my favorite item at Bouchon their take on the Nutter Butter So rich and peanut buttery it is such a simple but decadent treat I get cravings for them This is a tiny shop not much selection but everything we had was fantastic Prices are high but given the area and quality that gets put into these lovely desserts it is worth every penny,positive,68,50-75,366,<500
Only went for the cannolis but also bought cake The consistency of the cannoli was gritty and not very flavorful I bought 3 different cakes carrot rainbow and confetti All of which taste store brought The flavor of all three was just bland as hell Very disappointed and overpriced I gave two stars only because the customer service was decent,negative,60,50-75,351,<500
Ill be honest I am pretty disappointed with my last visit I really want to support businesses but I have to be honest Short Review  Been here a few times and each time wasnt great  Spent 30 on my last visit for 1 dozen donuts not the grilled cheesefrench toast btw  35 w 2 espresso  I know my donuts been nicknamed by others a donut expert haha thanks Ive been to several around the Vegas Valley and other cities  Yes these donuts are large pretty  Instagrammable a lot of people love this place but they taste more like bread not donuts Dry thick texture  seems like they were made the night before while other places make theirs fresh a few hours before opening and throughout the day  the donuts are lacking in flavor  Customer service is lacking as well pushy sales girls dont listen well over the loud music She tried to sell me the french toast  grilled cheese donut 3 times after I politely said no thank you each time Gave me confusing answers when I asked her questions Cashier wasnt friendly or nice either Btw they were not busy when I went in 89am  They will still do well in business despite my review and many others like it  Im not sure what they use in their recipe but it made me sick for a few days   If you were disappointed with the donuts or service here and want tasty fresh flavorful soft affordable donuts go to Ronalds Donuts in Chinatown or Friendly Donuts if youre near Boulder Hwy  Southeast Henderson  Hendertucky area Long Detailed Review  worth reading if you want to know why I dropped a few stars about their donuts and service If you know me and my reviews I am honest about my reviews and tend to look for the positives whats good in a place unless I got sick or something I went on a Saturday after breakfast wouldve came here for breakfast if we thought of it sooner Glad we didnt Read on to find out why At first I thought the girl helping us was friendly until she suggested the grilled cheese donut and french toast donut at least 3 times After I said no thank you each time I wonder if they get commission off of each french toast or grilled cheese donut they sell Ill call them sales girls because after a minute or so they turned into pushy sales girls The music was so loud in there I asked her a few questions and she gave me confusing answers Somehow we still ended up spending 35 THIRTY FIVE DOLLARS FOR ONE DOZEN DONUTS  2 Espressos Thats unheard of at any other donut shop I wouldnt mind if they tasted good but the dough in the donuts had no flavor it tasted more like bread Basically most of them tasted like bread with flavorless sugary frosting on it Im not sure what they use in their recipe but it made me sick for a few days  The donuts with filling in them had a pea size filling very small amount The toppings and frosting didnt taste like their name The specialty donuts like the Blueberry cheesecake pumpkin all the donuts we got were flavorless and disappointing I gave some to my family hoping theyll like it and eat it all up but my brothers didnt even want to try any donut LOL That is saying something WHO REFUSES OR THROWS OUT DONUTS Not this girl or anyone that I know We ended up throwing out a lot of the donuts If you like large donuts Instagrammable donuts this is your place If you want tasty fresh flavorful soft affordable donuts go to Ronalds Donuts in Chinatown or Friendly Donuts if youre near boulder Hwy  Southeast Henderson  Hendertucky area 2018 Yelp Challenge Review 14,negative,664,500+,3603,2000+

Was in Las Vegas for a Tournament and had a fancy dinner planned at Delmonicos at the Venetian 3 of our friends had birthdays in the past couple of weeks and we decided to go out and purchase birthday cakes to celebrate The original plan was to grab an Uber and go find a supermarket and grab a couple of birthday cakes when one of my buddies suggested I go to the Venetian Mall to Carloss Bakery as it was famous for having amazing cakes This would actually save me the time of hailing an Uber and traveling as it was in the same hotel as the restaurant What a grand ideaI thought So I went to Carlos Bakery waited almost 30 minutes which I was ok with especially thinking about how good the cakes were going to be I purchased 2 twelve inch birthday cakes one with chocolate and one with vanilla had the names placed on the top bought some candles and away I went I delivered them to the restaurant in anticipation of our feast that night Now we come into the restaurant and the meal is nothing short of amazing as it is Delmonicos Time for desert and I am so excited for my friends to try these amazing cakes that I found and personally carried gingerly all the way here The cakes were a total bust disappointment Dry stale and just not very good at all Not what I expected from a 35 small cake I expected Nirvana  complete bliss from my taste buds I called the bakery the next day to say we didnt eat the cakes as they were stale dry and the frosting was old and not fresh not only did we not eat the cakes but the waiter also passed on taking the left overs home Not what I expected for 70 I held and spoke to the manager and she put me on hold for some more finally she comes back on and states this was not our fault obviously the restaurant got the cake form you at noontime for your 6 oclock dinner then froze the cake then unfroze the cake and then served it to you But what I can do for you is to offer you a 15 discount the next time we bend you over and sell you stale cake for 7000 wasnt that kind of her I was a huge fan of the show of the product of it all that is right until I tried the product Not so impressed anymore You can keep my 70 I will make sure to tell 70 people this story Eric S,negative,445,300- 500,2258,2000+

The qualityprice ratio is pretty loweg 11 for a mini cheese cake 35 in diameter or genuine italian cannoli made without fresh ricotta cheese If you wanna get in you have to queue for almost an hour Theres limited seats and its not nice to eat your pastries there youll have to get it to gowhich makes it even more expensive considering that its essentially a to go place The staff is friendly Overall you can find much better pastries for that price or even less,negative,86,75-100,489,<500
I watched Christina Tosi as a master chef judge and was curious to try her desserts Although the hype for this place is good the prices are outrageous however the quality is better than other dessert places I been to And for the size of the dessert its a no go for the price I got the bite sized cookie dough flavored confetti and it was really good it was one of their truffles The others were the cookies and they tasted kind of like any other cookie but with a different flavor than your typical cookie The three cookies ran for 11 and the flavors were confetti marshmallow and blueberry The cookie truffle was 7 and you get three small balls It was definitely an experience that will be remembered Was it worth the price tag Hell No But was it worth the experience Yes I would say give it a one time try and call it quits I wouldnt go back but the dessert is very good Service was nonchalant The employee that served me was kind of boring and annoyed about the pandemic but pretty much everyone is They wore gloves as well as having a clear shield in front so you dont come in contact with the employee Its a mess but it is part of history for us folks,positive,224,200-250,1187,1000-1500

I really wanted to like this place since Im a big fan of his show I got a lobster tail cannoli and eclair was about 17 ish Ordering process was a bit different than some bakeries The Lobster tail was ok kind of tasted stale but the filling was good Eclair and cannoli both tasted stale with no flavor both the fillings were like tooth paste and dry like it had too much corn starch instead of a custard taste Im still a fan just probably came on Very bad day of baked goods,negative,94,75-100,484,<500
Seriously Handels Who thought of the bright idea to think ppl want to eat their ice cream I mean soup out in this weather You couldnt find a way to have some kind of inside seating And the service was atrocious The guy at the window could not have been any ruder Ice cream was ok but not worth the cost or having to sweat in it while eating Many other places worth going to than here,negative,77,75-100,394,<500
Good food but total rip off I was really excited to go here after watching Cake Boss for several years but I ended up disappointed We ordered 2 cream lobster tails a cookie a cannoli cheesecake and a slice of cake When we opened the box about an hour later at our hotel because the bakery is not dinein we only found 1 lobster tail The rest of the food was great but it was a rip off to pay 6 extra for something we didnt even get,negative,88,75-100,445,<500

The Milk Bar has been a huge disappointment for me given how much I love Chang and Momofuku At the center of the Milk Bars menu is a sampling of crazy pies and cookies Sometimes the flavor combinations work better than other times But the problem with even the best of them is that theyre baked somewhere else presumably in NYC and shipped across the nation to the various Milk Bar locations As a result they all taste very much like 3day old cookies baked at home They are dense and muted in flavor and for the price it is a huge disappointment I tried the ice cream for the first time here as well I tried both the Cereal Milk and Crack Pie flavors Both were OK but nothing much to speak of I had crushed corn flakes added to my Cereal Milk ice cream and also found its strong salted brown butter taste to be off putting Such a shame but Ill probably visit again next time Im in NY to see if its any better there,negative,179,150-200,935,500-1000

This place was one of the highlights to our trip such a nice place to hit on a hot day when all you want is ice cream The flavors change everyday so each time you come odds are youll have a totally different experience The cookie sandwich can be really messy and its not like the best cookie samich ive ever had but a solid contender thats hard to beat Im just upset that I had to house the thing since the bad boy was melting at such a rapid rate The staff was highly friendly nice to let us sample a few of the many flavors they had to offer The cup cakes and brownies are a solid choice if youre not feeling coffee Had one of each and they made a great breakfast even after having chilled in the whip for about a day b4 we munched Will def be coming back here,positive,155,150-200,779,500-1000
Dont even waste your time Im really surprised theres not more quality control At this point Buddy and his family have a reputation to uphold and this place wont do them any favors The staff was friendly but the pastries were terrible Dry and flavorless Every single thing Rainbow cookies chocolate chip cookies cannoli sfolgatelle all of it terrible,negative,59,50-75,365,<500
Its really hitormiss at Milk Bar but for the most part their desserts are way too sweet I saw the chefs episode  Christina Tosi  on Chefs Table on Netflix and have been to Milk Bars across the country and I dont recommend anything really which is a shame because I have lots of respect for the chef herself Heres what Ive had It was our friends bday so they brought over these Milk Balls to Momofuku to end the meal The only cute thing about it was the candle It was just a crumbled up formercake dusted with too much powdered sugar Id be embarrassed to serve this to people if I was the owner even if it was free it wasnt we paid for this abomination 110 Crack Pie  now its known as the milk bar pie  again too sweet but edible 510 Compost cookie kit  this is the only reason Im bumping up my review I brought home a tin with the ingredients from my trip to DC years ago and it was really fun to make and not bad at all 810 Assorted cookies got these for my bday this year and couldnt finish them Way too sweet and hardcrumbly 410 Overall everything is way too sweet at Milk Bar I heard their cereal milk soft serve is good so maybe the 5th time I visit one of their locations I can try it one day,negative,244,200-250,1252,1000-1500
Sought out this place once the wife and I found out they were putting a store here in Vegas I tell you what The hype is real on this joint At least for the red velvet cupcake anyway My wife really enjoyed the dark chocolate cupcake The only thing that seemed pretentious about it was that they made us wait in line outside so as not to crowd the joint,positive,70,50-75,357,<500
I cannot comment on the food because we did not get any I was excited to go to Carlos Bakery since I watch the show but first let me start by saying it was nearly impossible and a pain to find Then when you do find the place it is jam packed with people that you cannot even see the displays to decide what if anything you want to order There were way too many people and it was chaos Totally not worth the wait and not worth looking for when you are in Vegas Instead we went to Ben and Jerrys at Casino Royale and ended up just as happyor maybe even happier after Ive read all these sad reviews on the place,negative,124,100-150,623,500-1000
I love Amelies although Im pretty sure EVERYONE does  amazing creme brulee tasty lattes and the best croissants Ive had outside of France honorable mentions to Cafe Vanille in Boston and La Boite a Pain in Quebec though The only negative is that the line is usually incredibly long but I think its worth it,positive,56,50-75,321,<500
Ive never been so happy to pay for overpriced baked goods JONASAPPROVED,positive,12,<50,74,<500
I cant believe I havent written a review for this place yet The pastries here are excellent High quality and fresh The ambiance is very trendy with slight French overtones My hipster friends would love it My boyfriends mother hated it I love it Yes the food is pricey but its authentic and everything is made form scratch well worth the price in my opinion Be prepared for long lines though especially when college is in session and Friday and Saturday late night We waited in an hour ong line on Friday at 11pm It was so worth it though Its the only place you can satisfy your craving for a excellent pastry at 230am Cant wait to take my family here when they come to visit,positive,127,100-150,697,500-1000
They are not what they used to be Variety is great but I rather have freshness Way over priced,negative,19,<50,97,<500
This was my first time eating here The food was delicious but it was a very small serving size for a 12 sandwich I got the 12 turkey and Brie sandwich and cup of asparagus leek and spinach soup The 12 sandwich was smaller than my phone at about 3 inches long The price was 659 for such a small serving While delicious it was not worth it I wont be back,negative,72,50-75,368,<500
May i have my money back I will never waste my time or money ordering their bland cupcakes again maybe in the beginning this chain had a stellar product but he money has impacted the quality of their cakes no thanks and no thank you never again if you want a cupcake that will make you slap your self go to Big man bakes in DTLA you heard here first folks,negative,71,50-75,367,<500
This place was great There were a ton of unique ice cream flavors to choose from which were all amazing Highly recommend this place if youre looking for good ice cream and great service,positive,34,25-50,190,<500
Make sure you take a number there are no lines just wait to be called out The service is fairly quick It was hoppin on a Saturday mid afternoon The bakery items are descent not fabulous Ive been here a few times and if you have a sweet tooth it isnt bad just not really memorable or in my opinion worth the calories Today I needed a quick counter service meal and ordered the vege Stromboli I would not suggest coming here to eat Looking at the food nothing looked special or jumped out at me I kinda wish I hadnt bothered The menu board said the Stromboli had spinach mushrooms olives and roasted red peppers The olives were all together absent and the other three ingredients came from a freezer bag can or jar There was also a scant amount of ricotta cheese in there It was blah,negative,149,100-150,807,500-1000
My son called here looking for a job after dropping off an application to work here He liked this place their food having lots of fun memories with his friends and family over the years The owner or manager he spoke to was very rude and unprofessional to him saying if someone quits or I fire someone Ill let you know,negative,61,50-75,329,<500
Absolutely delightful I will for sure be back for more of this heavenly homemade goodness This icecream shop has a perfect variety of options from recommended icecream creations to shakes to kids ice cream with a plastic toy landed in it theyve got it all Churn uses top quality ingredients that are definitely appreciated I would best describe this spot as a step above Coldstone,positive,65,50-75,389,<500
Thank God for Bouchon Bakery In Vegas you are either dropping mad cash on good meals or you are eating slop at a food court Bouchon Bakery is for those moments you cant do the former or you are not too drunk or desperate to do the latter I could not bring myself to pay 1000 for a ham  cheese baguette no matter what but a coffee the focaccia of the day and a macaroon made an excellent mid afternoon meal,positive,82,75-100,414,<500
Shabby chic interior with a great selection of pastries and coffees Perfect place for brunch lunch or dinner and reasonably priced The salads are large and filling if you add chicken or salmon The salted caramel brownies are really worth it as well as the macarons,positive,46,25-50,271,<500
honestly my local grocery store is better Lower your expectations Cupcakes tasted very artificial Sprinkles is much better,negative,18,<50,127,<500
I use to come here frequently Unfortunately the new ownersmanagement have not figured how to run the place It takes way to long to get through the line Dont count on it to move as quickly as it has in the past Youll see more people give up and leave the line than people walk out with custard The employees dont even appear to be working with even a little bit of urgency I hope this improves,negative,77,75-100,404,<500
The appearance and awww of this bakery I found to be slightly misleading Upon entering I was blown away with the presentation of the baked items After a little thinking I bought 3 cupcakes and a donut Cupcakes were fair First they were cold Not really interested in cold cake The icing was ok The cake taste like it had mildew fish water Not one but all cupcakes Glazed donutsonly reason Id return,negative,73,50-75,410,<500
Macarons YUMMM Theyre are larger than what Im used to It took several bites for me to finish my sweet treat Im hooked Thanks Michelle Y and Tim B for getting these to cheer me up,positive,36,25-50,193,<500
Sorry to say that I am not a big fan Maybe part of it is having had much more sublime ice cream at places like BiRite Creamery in San Francisco where the sometimes long wait is worth it Or maybe because at a Baskin Robbins Ive never chewed on ice crystals while circumventing an ice cream scoop I was out bike riding and happened upon what turned out to be Churns opening day The women behind the counter were extremely polite and patient as I sampled three flavors I finally settled on blueberry I was pretty surprised when I was handed my cup and the scoop looked more like 34 of a kiddie scoop For 3 It barely filled the cup halfway Well last weekend a couple of friends and I had dinner at Windsor next door which we found quite yummy My friends hadnt tried Churn so I went along with it I sampled the peanut butter which even the one spoonful was somehow very heavy So I went with the tried and true vanilla To my surprise the scoop this time was what I would constitute as a regular scoop Yes I got more but the inconsistency kind of irked me Halfway through the ice cream I could hear and feel little ice crystals between my teeth That tells me something is not totally right with their icecream making process Also I tasted more sugar and milk than vanilla bean flavor Overall the vanilla was just OK I will happily go to Windsor any time but if someone suggests Churn I may have to bow out I dont wish the shop bad business I like the interior decor the festive displays of cookies candy etc I just dont feel the need to promote it to others,negative,298,250-300,1600,1500-2000
The bottom of the cereal bowl milkshakes and macaroon ice cream sandwiches are a must The staff is very friendly as well,positive,22,<50,122,<500
Im not much of a cupcake person I initially came here for the ice cream but I was lured in by the nice presentation of their cupcakes I had the banana cupcake with vanilla frosting and it was pretty good Had a deal on my receipt for a buy one get one free offer for cupcakes cookies or ice cream that I used before I flew back to seattle The seasonal flavor apple pie ice cream was beyond outstanding Will come back no doubt,positive,84,75-100,433,<500
Best smoothest hard scooped ice cream My family and I came in for a treat after going on the High Roller The line moved very fast and service was great We shared a banana split and it was huge It was so cool that we could change the ice cream and customize toppings with out any extra charge So we had rocky road ice cream and marshmallow topping instead of strawberry ice cream and pineapple toping The toppings were so fresh strawberry were real not the fake sugary type and they did not skimp The only negatives here are the bowls are plastic it would be cool if it was glass so its reusable Also the seating area is so small and crowded they really need a larger store,positive,129,100-150,686,500-1000
Meh We were there at 11 am on a Saturday morning after wed gone to Donutmania and found a poor selection Donut bar had even fewermaybe 20 but not a great variety We got a maple bacon apple fritterthe last one It was the only one left that wasnt just a regular donut After all we went there to try a fun different type of donut not just an old fashioned or a glazed donut So the bacon is just bacon bits that you buy in a jarnot real fresh bacon crumbles like I expected The fritter was dry and didnt have nearly enough apple in it nor glaze on it Had it been real bacon and more apple maybe it would have been worth the 4 Otherwise Id just stick to a national donut chain who knows what theyre doing,negative,141,100-150,734,500-1000
Horrible this place is very understaffed for the type of traffic they haveset up is so bad from order to pick upcant say how it tastes because I have been waiting for 30 min to get my orderfeel bad for the employees to have such a negligent owner,negative,48,25-50,256,<500
Im not a sweets guy and certainly not an ice cream guybut there is a reason National Geographic voted them best ice cream in the country,positive,26,25-50,143,<500
WoW Dont get the cookies Overpriced and terribile in taste Subway has better cookies,negative,14,<50,89,<500
I love this place The custard here is amazing My favorite is their specialty cold fudge Never knew that it could be so addicting Definitely a spot to go to treat yourself I also love how there are tables right outside so you could enjoy your treat with company,positive,49,25-50,267,<500
Tried this place for the first time on a warm Sunday night In short this was the best ice cream that I have tried in Charlotte I had the Gooey Butter Cake Ice Cream which was amazing This is a must I also had the Cream Puff which was also very good but paled in comparison My wife had the Sweet Potato with Marshmallows which she loved and the Pumpkin 5Spice which she said was average The store itself was very cute It was 5 for 2 half scoops which was well worth it The halfscoops were actually quite big In the future Im sure I will get the Gooey Butter Cake Ice Cream and then rotate my other scoop with one of their other great flavors,positive,127,100-150,659,500-1000
Great selection of pastries Nice dirty soy chai latte Cool ambiance A very busy and happening spot in the Queen City Id probably hang out here if I lived nearby,positive,30,25-50,166,<500
Went here twice while visiting the area Got the Turtle loved it Next time I got the double trouble and loved it as well Ice cream has great flavor Staff was attentive and good both times Strongly recommend,positive,38,25-50,212,<500
So disappointed by this place The donuts were just sad They look amazing but taste like disappointment We got there in the afternoon time so they were doing 10 boxes as many donuts you can fit in a box for 10 we were so excited to get to try a variety Smores on fire  eh  cake donut was sad Triple chocolate  more like 1 chocolate Blueberry  Meyer lemon  decent Creme brulee  eh cream was gross Chai  okay Chocolate covered old fashioned  gross Poptart  okay but so overly sweet Nutella  the only one where the donut dough was good Chocolate milk  dont get it not worth it 2 stars cause we would eat 2 donuts again blueberry  Meyer lemon  nutella and the staff was really nice,negative,138,100-150,703,500-1000
Im in love with the lavender lemonade Its totally worth the 45 minute drive for me Add in some carmel salted brownies macaroons and the chocolate croissants and youre good to go I have such a big sweet tooth so this place is my goto for treats The line can get really long and finding a place to sit is a challenge sometimes but the atmosphere is so casual and cool Theres always something new to look at,positive,78,75-100,418,<500
We were looking for a new dessert place and decided to try novel There was a line out the door when we got in the owner was really energetic and told us about his ice cream and the donuts I got a doughmelt with the fat Elvis ice cream and it was great The donut was fresh and delicious and the ice cream was very flavorful I will definitely go again,positive,71,50-75,356,<500
The old fashion look is very appealing with little nick nacks and old treats every where The shop is very small and quaint but loaded with good desserts I tried the Cookies and Mint which very good combination of 2 favorites blended just right I had it on a sugar cone which brought back memories of my childhood going to Baskin Robbins on my birthday in grade school A tip is if you order a scoop ask for half scoop of one flavor and get a second flavor and it is like getting to scoops for the price of one When we went there was no line and we walked up and were served right a way with even getting samples The is a sitting area in the back which is nice to sit and take your time Overall had a great first impression and will certainly come back to try other flavors and desserts Great job Churn,positive,158,150-200,809,500-1000
I love sprinkles but holy moly is this a poorly designed store Customers have no idea where to go for the ice cream flavors are by the exit so you have to try to reach over the people paying to grab a menu a rope and maybe an employee giving menus would work Second complaint tons of workers and only 2 people ahead of me yet it took over 15 mins to get them the ice cream line was a bit better Instead of doing a good job employees just kept apologizing for their screw ups Cupcakes great as usual will just use ATM from now on if I ever go to this one again,negative,115,100-150,568,500-1000
Very rude and unprofessional employee Taury Ice cream was ok Several people walked out during our visit Not worth the hassle,negative,21,<50,130,<500

Great food I definitely recommend this establishment They definitely have great customer service that matches the food,positive,17,<50,121,<500
Amazing ice cream and please expect a wait as you would at any other incredible small business that is very popular The selection is vast and the staff is super friendly I personally love the black cherry and the blueberry cheesecake chunk As a dessert junkie I keep going back and am grateful for this place,positive,56,50-75,312,<500
Cute little shop awesome ice cream great service That about sums it up  This place is adorable Their display of ice cream cookies and sweets is something right out of your dreamsand it has a retro vibe  They dont have 31 flavorsand yes you could probably buy a gallon or two of that grocery store stuff for the same price But you would be missing out What they lack in variety and affordability they more than make up for in quality I would rather eat ice cream here once or twice a month than have mediocre ice cream everyday You can sample any and everything They usually even have little samples of their various cones and cookies that you can try before you commit My favorites you ask Hands down the Butter Pecan Im not a Butter Pecan kind of girl normally As a matter of fact this is probably the only place that I eat Butter Pecan The flavor is ethereal You can really taste the separate components of the ice cream but they all come together beautifully The pecans alone are delicious You have to try itwords dont do it justice I also love their Vietnamese Coffee ice cream It tastes like the best Vietnamese Coffee youve ever had But frozen and creamier The Madagascar Vanilla is yummy as well as was their seasonal Pumpkin Pie Ive cream To be honest you probably cant go wrong here There wasnt one sample that I didnt like They have really friendly customer service They encourage you to try as many flavors as you want This place is always on my list when Im in townand I dream of it when Im not ,positive,285,250-300,1578,1500-2000
We were so excited to go for our first time Unfortunately the entire menu was sold out with the exception of the soft serve ice cream So we got that It DID taste like the milk at the bottom of a cereal bowl but it wasnt that great and far too sweet for our liking We thought it was way over priced s as well It seemed like a gimmick We ate half and threw the rest away Bummer,negative,79,75-100,389,<500
This bakery is great First off its Bouchon so you know you are going to be getting something good Secondly its an express bakery so no long waits I came here on Saturday morning and got the carrot cake cookie and two macaroons pistachio and salted caramel The carrot cake cookie was great The macaroons were some of the best I have ever had They were very large compared to macaroons I have had in the past but the best part was the creme filling It was very buttery I also ordered coffee and the coffee was very good too,positive,100,75-100,536,500-1000
im not an ice cream person but i find myself asking to go to honey hut more and more the workers there are young so mistakes are made but they are always courteous and fix any issue one may have i recommend the whipped cream  it is homemade and the absolute best whipped cream ive ever had,positive,58,50-75,295,<500
I love their dessert I came here every time I go to Cosmo I have gotten their Milk Bar pie crack pie and their cereal milk soft serve The first time I got their cereal milk soft serve we didnt know it comes with the actual cereal on it Just got one with my boyfriend and friend we all got cereal milk soft serve and this time they all came with cereal topping DELICIOUS Their crack pie was good too I usually get a slice and share For some people it can be little bit too rich but if you handle sweet like me I think its actually good Crack pie reminded me of ginger snap chewy cookie There are so many other goodies that I want to try Will definitely try other things next time Stay tunes,positive,138,100-150,709,500-1000
Great dairy free and vegan options Love the half scoops The line moved quickly and allowed for social distancing  The dairy free flavors were just as good as the dairy,positive,31,25-50,170,<500
Oh wow  I do not even care what the dessert tastes like We were at the Venetian in Vegas and expected a wait  they took our order in about 20 minutes I tried paying but the cashier said  you have to wait and be called And not with a nice tone no name tag so no name hmmm  so we waited in another line  and my kids and the family of kids in front of us were not being called Others way after us had their orders  a five pack of cannolis a complicated order especially since it is predefined get a new cashier with a new attitude,negative,114,100-150,562,500-1000
Very small amount of ice cream Very disappointed This place was hard to find because it is in a neighborhood and it is VERY small Previous reviews stated that it was inexpensive Well not true Today I was there and for a small 1 scoop vanilla ice cream in a bowl and an oreo cookie sprinkled on top and a donut we paid 997 The cup was the size of one that would be considered a child size think Dixie Cup size NOT worth your time,negative,86,75-100,444,<500
I finally had a chance to go here mainly because my tattoo artist in conveniently next door  i didnt realize at the time but i was quite lucky to go in without having to wait in a long line that stretches around the building Also i was lucky enough to get donuts because from what ive heard they sell out frequently I had a decent selection to choose from for it being midday One of the guys told me theres usually much more to choose from but they all sold out i got the strawberry cheescake peanut butter something the elvis and an original It was a meh for the original The elvis was delectable banana cream with caramel The peanut butter was a little dry As for the cheesecake i cant comment because i ate it the next day Will definitely be going back again mainly to try the churrolooking donut cone they have Also the staff was very friendly,positive,162,150-200,874,500-1000
Cupcakes were ok but nothing special Not worth the visit if you ask me We tried 3 different kinds are were not impressed with any of them Selection was slim Just expected to be wowd so it was a big let down,negative,42,25-50,214,<500
Not worth it Shake flavors arent great and the cookies are like a store bought packaged cookie,negative,17,<50,97,<500
A very unique place the best part is that they are open all the time They have some very interesting chandeliers and paintings Good variety of pastries as well as their cheese flavors that they have The coffee is kickass here over all a very good place to hang out It has mixed crowds and perfect location in NODA I do plan to visit it more often on my trips to Charlotte,positive,72,50-75,379,<500
Still dreaming about the delicious goodness that is the strawberry croissant even though its been more than a month since Ive been here drooool This is no place for people on a lowcarb diet Their pastries are so ridiculously good  you really cant go wrong with anything on display Their macaroons are monster and the size of your face but my favorites here are the croissants The almond croissant the chocolate and my personal fave  the strawberry croissant are all to die for Perfect flakiness sweetness and the texture of the smooth strawberry fillingomg Who needs cronuts when you have croissants like these They make a solid brew as well and the service was friendly A definitely goto whenever Im in Vegas and around the Venetian,positive,128,100-150,759,500-1000
Very disappointing Its a hidden location and not at all what i was expecting Very much over rated Tried most of their flavors but the ice cream all had a weird after taste to them I think i didnt like the base they use for the ice cream The marshmallow was burnt and uncomfortably sweet Wouldnt recommend wouldnt go again,negative,60,50-75,329,<500
Horrible Horrible Horrible We purchased some baked goods here and turns out they didnt include them in the bag  I even contacted them using their website and the only response I received was at which location did this happen and of course I responded but never heard from them again Pretty disappointed especially when we paid for these expensive treats Shame on you Carlos Bake Shop This was certainly not a great first time visit experience ,negative,78,75-100,461,<500
Heart broken at the taste of the pastries for 59 dollars The covid precautions were non existent besides wearing masks everyone was one on top of another so disappointing,negative,29,25-50,175,<500
We walked over at 445 only to realize the store was closed and its now a janky little ice cream cart inside of Jobot which no one was attending to and all the ice cream had freezer burn Woof Why cant good things stay the same,negative,46,25-50,231,<500
Great gelato great coffee and great pastriesdesserts to indulge in as you come here before and after your meal in Little Italy I think its probably best after a good meal in any of the many restaurants surrounding the bakery The place is wide open and can easily get busy especially as the weekend nears when we all have time to experience life outside of work If youre in the area come here get your italian sweet fixyou wont be diappointed,positive,81,75-100,457,<500
If you eat with your eyes this is the place for you The shop was charming and the staff very attentive The toppings were creative However I found that despite the delicious descriptions and appealing looking donuts the taste of these donuts was So So Perhaps I selected the wrong donuts but I found that the donut base was cakie and did not complement the toppings However the coffee was excellent,negative,71,50-75,407,<500
Outta sight Finally was able to try this place and at First Fridays no less but I was amazed by the kitschy donut I bought POPTART DONUT is exactly what you think tastes like a Poptart looks like a Poptart has a Poptart in it At 4 this is a massive donut and well worth the price I recommend sharing even though I didnt because I have a problem with not sharing donuts but you certainly can share this and be satisfied Its a strawberryflavored tart inside and includes extra homemade strawberry jelly along with the hidden Poptart inside White frosting colorful crumb topping and strawberry drizzle included Cant wait to try more of their donuts,positive,116,100-150,676,500-1000
Waaaaayyyy overrated Extremely disappointed My girls and I were huge Cake boss fans so Carlos was a must visit on our trip to Vegas Line wasnt too bad but the whole ordering check out process was so inefficient You pick out what you want then have to wait for one person to box it up I had to try his famous red velvet cupcake Nothing special and the frosting desperately needed more sugar It tasted like plain cream cheese My daughter had lobster tailloaded with way too much filling to make it enjoyable My other daughter had a mini cheesecake which was overly sweet Im not one to write bad reviewsthis is a first for meIm miffed we wasted time and money for such mediocre baked goods,negative,127,100-150,713,500-1000
Such a disappointment We are huge cake boss fans and have been to this bakery beforeas others have noted the lines are SLOW they always seem understaffed Also there are no prices posted so you just order and pay out the nose The worst part though they give the illusion of things being baked fresh in the bakery next door which must be a hoax since the eclair we ordered as a part of our large family order was unmistakably FREEZER BURNT So sad Theres no way we will be back even though some of the desserts are fabulous 20 options Dont you guys taste your products for quality control Thanks but no thanks,negative,114,100-150,630,500-1000
Amazing owners and amazing bakery I had the Italian cream cake and it was the best cake Ive had in a loooooong time Not too sweet  so you can eat the whole piece Great service too,positive,37,25-50,186,<500
I used to looove this place hence my previous 5 star review but the last few times its been so beyond lacking in service I dont know if its what Ive been ordering or what but it takes forever And I dont think a shake at an ice cream place is crazy People will get served way before and Ive had to ask if my stuff is going to come out When you ask its like a lightbulb comes on and they realize they forgot your items I asked for two scoops of ice cream the first time and that took 25 minutes to get after asking about it This most recent time was a mint chocolate chip bowl which came out timely but melted all over my jeans and car by the end of it because they couldnt give me a lid and a strawberry shortcake shake which took crazy long to produce I love this place but I have no idea what is happening,negative,166,150-200,835,500-1000
Becoming NO is a charlotte staple I have frequent the original local on many occasions I have seen bible study women meeting and girls hanging out People with dyed hair no hair and wings premed Student studying and groups catching up This is an inclusive space and more importantly a safe one I am actually a fan of their pastries although my friends would beg to differ They love the savory soups and sandwiches I started my Amelie affection based on the tart hazelnut was my fav but have shifted to their palmers macrons and recently sticky buns They have an eclectic variety of options made fresh daily and with that being said it can be hit or miss on the available options Be openminded while going as the prices are not for the faint of heart The dÃcor is cute and Parisian inspired which is a cute homage Now that they have branched out I have found that there are more locations in and around charlotte and can always sneak in for a quite bite download coffee or chat with friends I highly suggest you give it a try Dont be surprised if you being to plan your next vaca to Paris Bonjour,positive,204,200-250,1127,1000-1500

My husband and I stopped in to redeem a Groupon I purchased today for 1500 in donuts I read a few weeks back that this donut shop received an award for Best of Las Vegas and was featured in the magazine that was inside the Las Vegas ReviewJournal We arrived after 1130 am and paid for parking outside the establishment Upon entering the store it was reasonably busy as they close at 200 pm A pleasant and helpful young lady greeted us I informed her we were redeeming a Groupon I explained that this was our first time visiting their store She graciously explained the various donuts they had from regular size to very large She let me know which ones were their bestsellers She described some as being very light and fluffy She was very patient as we made our selections She let me know when I reached 1500 She took us to the register and told me to wait a minute She returned shortly with another box of various donuts including some of the enormous donuts I redeemed my Groupon and thanked her Due to the beautiful customer service and the delightful donuts my family and I indulged in when we returned to Henderson we will be repeat customers as these are some of the best donuts weve eaten and we have tried many donut shops over the 45 years This is the place to come and worth the drive Its outstanding,positive,244,200-250,1340,1000-1500

Really yummy ice cream with a high price tag Not as expensive as some of the gelato places But I got two kiddie scoops and 1 small and it was 15 The flavors are very interesting and its very creamy Cool spot to have ice cream at Its in a great location however weekend parking may be tough We found parking easily during the week early afternoon The confetti heart mural is behind the ice cream shop fun spot for pictures with your cone,positive,84,75-100,455,<500
Could not wait to go for my birthday  drove an hour to come but they wouldnt allow my boys who are 14  16 come in with me so we had to leave Their business their decision Just a warning to all would want to go because the sign says children are allowed with parent but when we entered we were told if over 11 they have to come in by themselves,negative,73,50-75,349,<500
Recently I went to this establishment and tried to purchase some ice cream I was standing in line and the person in front of me was done making their purchase The server asked everyone but me if they had been served He walked away from me and went to another customer I immediately walked to him and told him that I was in here before the people he started helping next He told me that it was bar style and I would have to wait I dont want to say it was race but as a fact I was the only black person in there I immediately walked out to never walk back in there again Young white male working on 5118 at 550 pm,negative,125,100-150,626,500-1000
This place has been hyped up because of its delicious well presented donuts I Took my boys there to try out some of their creations My one son decided on the donut cone with vanilla Ice cream I decided on the apple fritter and my younger son got the birthday cake donut Heres where the review goes south My son tried and ate the cone with ice cream and said that the cone tasted like pre made pilsbury pastry dough the apple fritter I was expecting to taste full of apple and moist was VERY DRY over cooked and had not much Apple to find in it and as for my younger sons birthday cake donut it too was very dry and made Dunkin look like the king of the cake donuts The 3 donuts total were 1100 yes that was for 3 donuts So for them to claim they are bestdonutsintheworld not in the eyes of this consumer Pink box donuts can easily out do donut bar on quality taste and price,negative,173,150-200,894,500-1000
Cookie cup was amazing I am not a big ice cream fan but this was so good I polished off the whole thing Will definitely go back again Place is kinda out of the way so tell all your friends about it I hope this place is around for the next 50 years Gentleman running it was so nice allowing you to sample the ice cream flavors before ordering,positive,69,50-75,347,<500
This place is pure hype It was featured on Chefs table and praised by David Chang so I thought I would give it a try I do not mind paying for decent food or dessert but this place is absurdly over priced The ice cream is super bland And all the pies cookies cake truffle ball dessert were all packaged I honestly think I can find a better tasting dessert at Walmart I highly DO NOT recommend this place,negative,79,75-100,412,<500
This is our go to for breakfast everyday we are in Vegas So yummy Our favorites are still great Unfortunately they have changed their process and the service is now AWFUL This place would be five stars if the service hadnt deteriorated so badly We were also sad to see that they no longer have chocolate eclairs or the roast beef sandwich which ere discontinued Their great service has been discontinued as well They used to have outgoing polite young ladies who also wore gloves when picking out your food Now they have rude noncommunicative sarcastic guys who are right out of high school with bad attitudes They couldnt bother with simple manners like youre welcome or even thank you Thomas Keller should personally come to this bakery and start firing people,negative,132,100-150,785,500-1000
Used to be one of my favorite sweet spots until the rude greeting the team just gave us 5 mins to close One girl rolled her eyes at us and another said hurry up you have 20 seconds Not the vibe I want satisfying my sweet tooth after a fun night at the Linq Ill go across the street to Serendipity next time,negative,63,50-75,311,<500
Review of first visit to Churn on 12015 Pro It must have been my lucky ice cream day Found parking and no line at this cute little place Super friendly staff let me taste just about everything I decided on the AMAZING goat cheese honey pistachio and the Chocolate Hazelnut on a plain cone The bill was under 5 An amazing bargain for a 2 scoop cone by artisanal ice cream standards Cons No inside seating Back patio is a postage stamp size cutie pie sitting area Front seating on the street What people do in the heat of summer I dont know,positive,103,100-150,557,500-1000
Lots of great flavors Had 4 dairy free options which is amazing Flavors were all fun go here super fun Its a little neighborhood place surrounded by homes super cute Oh dont forget the temperature changing spoons cool touch,positive,39,25-50,236,<500
Really People  That many of you gave this place 4 or 5 stars I guess if youre a foodie and want to tell your friends Porschea and Chad that you just had Salmon Tartare and saffron ice cream and it was Just Faaabulous  this is the spot for you Exotic flavors aside lets talk about the product which is ice cream it tasted watery and bland not creamy and rich like a premium homemade ice cream should The scoops are small and over priced given the quality of the ice cream Side note I bought an oatmeal cookie which looked amazing but didnt have much flavor and had a bitter after taste threw 34 of it away If you looking for a good ice cream fix try the turtle sundae at Culvers but be warned Chad and Porchea wont be impressed,negative,143,100-150,754,500-1000
Ah this place was recommended by friends from Charlotte during our visit and we LOVED it Sometimes beautiful desserts are just that but the ice cream macaroons and shakes here were DELICIOUS I tried the strawberry green tea macaroon sandwich  LARGE green tea macaroons on each side with strawberry ice cream with huge real strawberry chunks inside It was phenomenal They also added some matcha drizzle My sister loved their chocolate shake They charge appropriately  I felt like 6 was appropriate for the huge macaroons and the large scoop of ice cream Definitely recommend Get some ice cream to cool down and then head over to to the lake for some paddleboating,positive,114,100-150,680,500-1000
Wanted to give this place a second chance so my boyfriend and I headed here after we got dinner downtown Unfortunately they lost another star in this updated review I wanted to get three flavors essentially chocolate vanilla and strawberry I was actually pretty excited because last time I was here they had zero chocolate flavors so I wanted to try that one for sure Well I ordered those three and the employee told me that its one flavor per cup I looked over at the cartons little Chinese restaurant togo containers and figured oh its probably just because those are small Well I was wrong What they do is put two HUGE scoops in there but tell you that you cant combine scoops and get two separate flavors So basically I nixed the strawberry and just asked her for vanilla and chocolate and ended up getting four scoops two of each flavor when all I was asking for was one of each That is so asinine She could tell I was not pleased by this and she said Sorry I dont make the rules Such poor customer service I ended up spending 20 on two cups when I should have spent half that which is probably why they do it Ridiculous On top of all of that they use the CHEAPEST spoons known to man see my pic attached You literally cannot scoop anything out of the container because it bends all the way backwards And its a freaking SOUP SPOON Not at all practical for eating ice cream Makes me seriously question the people who run this place Also this location is just freakin weird Its a bar with mannequins and skeletons and crap Just not at all my vibe for when Im wanting a classic scoop shop Maybe others think its cool and unique but not my thing Id give them one star if I could but the ice cream really is good If you want better customer service and a tad better ice cream make the drive to Churn in Uptown Can definitely say that I wont be back,negative,353,300- 500,1912,1500-2000
Had a chance to come in and try 85 degrees Thank goodness the line wasnt too long but still waited for a decent amount of time I totally understand why the wait is so long and what else do you expect from a business thats so well known to finally open a location here in Vegas  Of course its going to be hectic for about a month or two so it seems unfair to give them a low rating due to long wait and being crowded It was around 3pm when we arrived and a lot of the pastries were out already I definitely recommend coming in earlier to score on some of their delicious baked goods Even though we didnt get to try a whole bunch what we got was super good  We also ordered drinks and I have to say that the 85 degrees iced coffee is delicious Will be back for more My girlfriend got the iced hazelnut latte and it was a little too sweet  If you come in and only want a drink you can order from the kiosk up front so you dont have to wait in a longer line   Inside is pretty big but the seating area is a bit small I dont think it will be a good place for a study session but more of a quick casual kind of thing Overall we did enjoy the pastries and drinks but will probably be back when they start to settle down a bit Or maybe right when they open ,positive,263,250-300,1282,1000-1500
I almost always have to stop and get ice cream here when Im in Ohio city The only time I dont is when Im on a diet lol Anyways I visited this past week and I am always amazed at their attentive service They allow you to try as many flavors as you want and dont get upset I love the glass walls and how you can go upstairs and watch how they make their product Very cool Usually I dont pay attention to sorbets or vegan ice cream options because I usually go for the creamy ice cream  I have no restrictions when it comes to ice cream But my friend wanted to stop in to get vegan ice cream togo and what do you know they had 2 vegan options chocolate and a salty caramel He bought 1 of each pint and they even sold Vegan cones,positive,150,100-150,742,500-1000
Severely understaffed or just badly managed People lined up all the way to the door to pay and theres one person on the register Staff doesnt seem to care When I was there last people were shouting to have someone man the other registers Sitting area is a mess since theres no one cleaning it I know theyve only been open a couple of months but thats enough time to figure out what needs fixing,negative,75,50-75,405,<500
Probably the greatest ice cream spot definitely in Pittsburgh maybe the US The atmosphere is what makes Page stand out  the location tucked under a rail bridge the excessive signage the old fashioned building and lights the lines wrapping around the parking lot The ice cream selection is immense and can be a bit hit or miss but generally delicious Special flavors are usually winners The fresh blueberry soft serve is soooo good Ive never had anything like it before and was blown away by how fresh it was If youre feeling decadent the specialty sundaes are intense and delicious The cinnamon roll one is my favorite,positive,108,100-150,636,500-1000
I have honestly never felt the need to review anything on here but oh my god my experience was absolutely terrible and I have never been so annoyed with a purchase 1 The atmosphere is actually the worst thing I have ever come across especially for a restaurant attempting to be trendy Silver garland that changes color should stay at my greataunts Christmas party not a restaurant Mismatched wood wall accents EVERYWHERE make the place look like the designer stopped at a lumber liquidation sale and bought everything whether it went together or not The seashell tiling is atrocious and doesnt fit the vibe at all if one can even call the aesthetic of this place a vibe And who thinks velvet seating with RHINESTONES is okay for any restaurant that caters to anyone older than 6 And super limited seating but I didnt want to stay in the place long enough to deal with it 2 The wait was ridiculous for having ordered one basic crepe with absolutely no line in front of me I had to stay in the hell hole way too long for comfort 3 Finally the food It was mediocre if Im trying to be nice My real issue was the pricing of it though Youd think that for 750 youd at least get two scoops of ice cream Theres a little scoop of ice cream on the top but it wasnt proportionate to the amount of crepe I had to eat The crepe was shaped like an ice cream cone so once the small amount of ice cream was eaten you were left with a dry plain crepe Needless to say I will not be returning Please replace with a better restaurant because I love crepes and would love to eat them regularly but not at this place,negative,304,300- 500,1641,1500-2000
On my daughters trip to Vegas she brought me back a 6 pack of cupcakes Ive watched the show I always wanted to try their cupcakes because of the way people always went ballistic on the show Presentation was exceptional with fondant cards on top Fondant had no taste and throw it Pretty boxes that survived the plane ride back with no damage to presentation With the cupcakes I was expecting more and disappointed 1 Vanilla cupcake w buttercream cake was dry with no exceptional flavor Buttercream was basic shortening taste and heavy Not sweet Ive had better 2 Chocolate cupcake w buttercream cake was dry I was at least expecting a more richer chocolate flavor It wasnt Buttercream tasted better with this flavor 3 Chocolate cupcake with peanut butter frosting cake was the same as above Frosting was a real peanut butter taste I like it sweeter I didnt like it and throw it I gave 3 cupcakes to a neighbor They werent impressed either Overall its your typical italian bakery not to sweet Over hyped because of the show For myself to give away cupcakes it wasnt good,negative,190,150-200,1111,1000-1500
I always grab a cup of tea in the morning from Bouchon Bakery when my friends and I stay at Venetian I went recently this past weekend and asked if they can make me an Earl Grey tea latte And it was meh Ive had better Coffee Bean makes it better Earl Grey w nonfat milk  a quarter of their vanilla powder Ive had the macarons there before but it wasnt fab And on a side note Im reading some of the reviews and people MACARONS and MACAROONS are different Google it and get it straight Also tried their donuts chocolate and rasberry filled but they were not all that great either But their other pastries definitely look delicious Maybe those taste better,negative,124,100-150,676,500-1000
After walking 2 miles to get here waiting in line and pondering the 9 scoop banana split and slowly getting more excited for ice cream on a hot summer evening we were cut in line by two people not wearing masks One pulled his sweaty bandana off his head and wrapped it over his mouth The other pulled her shirt up over her mouth Wearing a face covering is required by local laws and is important to reduce the spread of illness I chose not to spend my money here in hopes of staying alive,negative,95,75-100,497,<500
Uhg so bad we literally had to throw more then half of it away Literally it just takes like a blob of shit Salty and bland as the same time To make this clear my Sugar fanatic child thought it was gross and was the one to throw it away We got the chocolate chip with marshmallow and corn chip cookies with the soft serve and sprinkles and cornflakes Ended up Adding fudge to help  it didnt work 17 for a sundae funday What a waste of money and calories Service was okay not bad but nothing special they did the job theyre there for however if milk products are so significantly unique and unlike any other and takes a special Tongue to enjoy employees may want to ask questions and engage a little bit with customers Examples of questions to ask knowing the product again is so rare to taste 1 Have you tried any of our products before 2 What kind of flavors do you normally enjoy 3 Would you like to sample perhaps I am aware of the pandemic however many other places are currently again offering samples And if you can operate a business By putting Product in a big cup you can try putting it in a very small cup or a spoon as well,negative,221,200-250,1145,1000-1500
All my friends love this place Ive been a handful of times mornings and tried multiple items in the case food is either cold or stale The decorations and the staff were very nice 5 stars for them,negative,38,25-50,203,<500
We were excited to try this place out after scoping it out before lunch A sweet lady that worked there encouraged is to taste samples even though we said we werent ordering until after lunch When we returned after lunch we were all set to order and since there was 6 of us it was a lengthy process to get all of our ice cream We also wanted fudge and they got annoyed and asked us to step aside The head of production then charged us for fudge before we could order what we wanted and wouldnt adjust the transaction when we explained we wanted the buy 4 get 2 deal She told us to pick a fudge and leave If we wanted that deal we would need to buy it again Overall it was sad to have that experience in such a nice shop It wasnt even busy when we were trying to sort out the miscommunication I wont return again,negative,162,150-200,830,500-1000
I came here with my best friend who had always wanted to try the desserts here The place is really cute and everything looks so good Thats where the positives stop I ordered the strawberry shortcake and the rainbow cake I paid 19 bucks and some change and while I wasnt too thrilled about how thin the slices were I wasnt upset either since When I bit into the strawberry shortcake I was hit with this chemicallike bitter taste The cake was dry but would dissolve into my mouth into a sludge like consistency I thought it was me because I was eating it in my hotel room after having dinner and assumed it was my taste buds clashing After several bites and the flavor not getting any better I had my best friend try my cake She gagged I thought that maybe they might have missed an important ingredient when making the cake so I immediately tried the rainbow cake The batter tasted bad like the first cake and the icing tasted like the icing one makes when they mix that sugary powder that comes in a gingerbread making kit with water not horrible but also not high end or worth the money We tried the confetti cake my friend bought and it was the same thing I will say it wasnt as horrible as the cakes I ordered but still not worth the hype Im honestly really confused as to how this business has gotten so much positive attention when the cakes arent edible Im definitely curious about the lobster tail and cannoli since thats what everyone on here has recommended Maybe if I had gotten that my review would be more positive Im definitely not willing to chance it though if Im ever staying at the Venetian again,negative,301,300- 500,1649,1500-2000
I went to this place with super high expectations but was REALLY disappointed when I ordered a shake yesterday and the girl making it literally gave chocolate milk I gave it back telling her it was terrible and she made me another one that was thicker but equally terrible,negative,49,25-50,276,<500

Note this review is based on the ridiculous wait time The product is actually good but you have to be kidding me With how long your wait time in line is This is the second time Ive waited in line and left without purchasing anything And covid is not an excuse How long does it take to purchase premade pastries etc from a case A very long time apparently Sadly as much as I want to keep supporting local this place lost it for me today,negative,86,75-100,448,<500

Against the warning of a close friend we decided to try Mary Coyles tonight The place was busy  the staff 3 young people and an older man seemed very disorganized We werent offered samples  werent acknowledged by the person running the register until we asked if we could order Ice cream was only ok  I doubt they make it in house My boyfriend ordered a chocolate malt  received a vanilla one If you decide to try it out which I would advise against with so many better ice cream or gelato shops in the valley ask for it to go as seating is limited,negative,108,100-150,571,500-1000

Jenis is good Really good Compared to my other favorite ice cream shops in charlotte jenis takes the cake Prepare to stand in line for a while if you go at a busy time The line doesnt move all that fast but trust me its worth it Waffle cones are made in house which is always a massive plus Choosing from the flavors was no simple task and is most likely the reason for the slow line You can try as much ice cream as you want too The ice cream itself is creamy rich and exploding with flavorful calories All in all this place is chill Open one in plaza Thanks,positive,112,100-150,577,500-1000
One of my new favorite places for ice cream First of all its connected to Windsor my favorite restaurant and Old Fashioned second of all they have a bunch of fun flavors yes I tried them all Dont judge me The service is great theyre super nice One of the ice cream scoopers noticed my husbands Seahawks shirt and asked if were from Seattle He said hes headed back to Washington next week for school Its so nice to meet genuine people who can relate to you They have a Peanut Butter and Jelly flavor that tastes A LOT like an uncrustable sandwich The Butter Pecan should have a danger label on it because you could easily eat an entire tub of it it has crunchy pecans and melts in your mouth The girl helping us said her favorite is the Blueberry Cheesecake which was delicious It tastes like a Blueberry Ocream pie that I make on Thanksgiving They also have Floats one is called Caramel Apple Pie with vanilla ice cream salted caramel apple SODA and cinnamon sugar I dont know what Apple Soda is but I want it The chocolate peanut butter and coffee were sooo good and perfect bases for toppings Theres also a bunch of cone options Pretzel cone Everything was so good we literally couldnt decide We went with the most popular I know boring and ordered the Smores It has chocolate ice cream hot fudge butter Grahams better than any graham cracker Ive ever had and heres where it gets good toasted marshmallow fluff Honestly I dont typically like marshmallows and I really didnt want a big mouth full of marshmallow But this is not your typical marshmallow This is that runny fluffy stuff thats toasted to a crisp on top and compliments the ice cream perfectly I actually dont think Ill ever get ice cream again without this toasted cloud on top,positive,319,300- 500,1826,1500-2000

Since the reviews were good and we were craving a banana split we drove from 20 minutes away to enjoy some good desert We arrived at 930 which seems like plenty of time to order and eat before the 10pm closing time We waited for 20 minutes for them to make the split After having served the 2 groups that had ordered after us we started to watch the 3 workers behind the counter to see if they were making our split This is when we noticed they were standing there chatting not working about their social lives Not a huge deal to be served after but when they finally made our split what they presented us with was a Banana Split in 4 different containers for us to take with us WHAT When I inquired why it was package to go I was informed that since they close at 10 and dont get paid to stay after Keep in mind it was still 950 Since we are in a hotel on vacation I could not drive the 20 minutes back and eat it out of 4 containers in my room I expressed that they should have told us when we ordering it would be To Go so we could have decided if we wanted to continue with our order NOT GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE at all I am so sorry that I the customer inconvienced them Proceed with caution after 930,negative,241,200-250,1244,1000-1500
It was our first time at Bouchon Bakery in Napa and the original is so much more amazing than the Las Vegas location Where have you been all my life Oh yah Im trying to be gluten free and low carb Well it was our anniversary weekend and we went hog wild It was worth standing in line 6 apart for this carb madness I think we got every croissant type and two macarons We ate the strawberry croissant on our way to our lunch reservation and I can still recall the buttery flaky goodness with spray of strawberry in my mouth Oh so good If they were near me I would definitely be so fat Id have to give up my profession as a wellnessbased chiropractor This day was one of those do as I say not what I do Worth it,positive,143,100-150,733,500-1000
Batch is home to local savory and sweet treats that are perfectly delightful  highly recommend You can find baked goods in all sizes  ranging from small shortbread cookie bites and minicupcakes to whole cakes and loaves of bread The gruyere croissant is my goto  I usually take this to go and heat it up for a couple of minutes in the stove so the cheese melts Batch is also a great place to stop if youre charged with bringing a dessert to a party I just tried a peanut butter mini cupcake for a dinner party tonight and the frosting was everything Batch is a local favorite for a reason I noticed a sign today that Batch is now serving Kin Kin coffee So after years of having subpar coffee looks like Batch is getting on board to be a onestop breakfast shop And if you want a different coffee concoction to go with your bakery Cafe Domestique right next door has amazing coffee lattes and tea options You cannot go wrong on this block of Willy St,positive,181,150-200,970,500-1000
The rose milk latte was delicious and pretty to look at The matcha coconut was refreshing without being too sweet the boba was chewy and fresh Will go again A little bit of a long wait but I think that is because they were cutting open a coconut The ice cream looked delicious as well different options Small menu but since each drink is hand crafted the taste is superb and doesnt need a big menu to compensate,positive,78,75-100,418,<500
At 930 pm we had a 20 min wait to get in our order so we were really curious as to finding out what was so special about these ice creams Dont plan your order beforehand as they do not have all the flavors from their menu So I ended up taking the toasted coconut ice cream with toasted marshmallow fluff and Reeses It was delicious The toasted coconut ice cream was very coconutty and I could taste the shredded coconut through the ice cream The ambience and outdoor seating reminds me of a college hangout area Its a simple social setting Overall a great place minus one because toasted coconut wasnt my first preference and the place did not have all the flavors mentioned in the menu But a place everyone should visit at least once,positive,137,100-150,748,500-1000

We purchased items here when they first opened 2 years ago We were highly impressed with the chocolate cannoli but disappointed in the lobster tails and especially in the red velvet cupcakes both very dry We tried again last year The cookies werent all that impressive and the regular cannoli was just okay This year we were more than disappointed We were looking forward to having the chocolate cannoli again Unfortunately they now only have them on some weekends We ended up with a dry donut extremely dry biscotti and an unimpressive Linzer cookie with tart and too sweet strawberry filling They really didnt have much to offer other than cookies and cupcakes They did have lobster tails but didnt try again since we didnt care for them the first time They have small twoserving Bundt sized cakes for almost 10 each Figured wed skip them since everything we have purchased other than the cannoli has been dry and almost tasted day old Its really too bad because everything on their show looks so fresh and delicious I think Buddy needs to do a surprise visit during the week and do a surprise inspection,negative,194,150-200,1134,1000-1500

Usually a fan of ice cream I was very much disappointed in the tastelessness of this softserve I was expecting some type of flavor dimension but it simply came flat The ice cream tasted like plain 2 milk not even a hint of vanilla or anythingso if you enjoy some type of flavorsugar in your ice cream this is not for you Next the cost of the cornflake topping was just outlandishly expensive Literally the cost of the cereal topping on two ice creams would make up the cost of the whole box at local grocery store Definitely one of the most overpriced spots for super bland ice cream I do not recommend but if youre curious about the hype just like me then try it for yourself but dont have too high expectations,negative,134,100-150,731,500-1000
After watching The tv show we finally had to see what all the fuss is about While we enjoyed our desert the line up was obnoxiously long for on the only reason of a very poor system from the ordering to the purchasing process Taking upwards of 45mins for no more then 20ppl to Grab and Go their orders The displays looked nice but nothing is labeled nor has pricing also causing every customer to ask a 100 questions to find the right baked good for them While everything comes neatly packaged This process takes so long to wrap all the goods For two mini cakes and 2 eclares it was 2994 which even for Vegas is way over priced my time and my bank account would like a refund I do not feel these baked goods are superior to any other bakery that I never have to stand in line for Its very unfortunate,negative,155,150-200,812,500-1000

Know this If I lived within walking distance of Jack Frost Donuts I would most likely be rocking a large B possibly small C cup Im a man,positive,28,25-50,144,<500
So after reading all the hype I thought that these donuts would be wonderful They are absolutely terrible They look good but the taste does not deliver I got a chocolate cream and a PB cream filled donut I did not finish eating either of them The creme was NASTY These donuts are obviously made with substandard ingredients The donuts were not sweet at all like a donut should be NEVER AGAIN,negative,72,50-75,401,<500
Good ice cream but the employees just didnt feel like they wanted to be there Yeah there probably more then likely college students but if you dont like your job then just leave I would love to come again hopefully with a better attitude and character from the employees Moving forward with the ice cream I had the chocolate chip Greek yogurt I think thats whats it called it was great But you MUST try the orange chocolate chip ice cream its a common favorite my aunt had it Next time your around the area stop by All of the ice cream looked so delicious,negative,105,100-150,574,500-1000

Very unwelcoming staff Long line which moves fairly fast and now I know why it does They treat you like the number you are supposed to pick They rush you expecting you to know what you want I have 4 kids and they wanted to take a peek around The girl behind the counter snapped at me because I was unsure of what I was ordering so I guess I mispronounced it Sorry Again just like Buddy Vs the pastries were good but because of the lack of customer service you got that cold unwelcome and unwanted experience So disheartening We were there for my daughters birthday who wants to be a baker because of Buddy and she felt again personally let down by Buddy himself,negative,126,100-150,675,500-1000

Wasnt as impressed with the popular salted caramel brownie as I had hoped Seems to be a lot of the hype of this place and it was a bit too richsweet and more like a fudge than a brownie That being said the atmosphere is great  a huge plus to me  and the staff was fairy friendly It was pretty packed on a Tuesday night could barley find a table So it must be pretty great All the good looked really good so Ill probably come back to try the food Seemed like the perfect place to work for a while or post up with a coffee to relax,positive,111,100-150,544,500-1000
One part ice cream parlor one part chocolate shop All parts very cool all the time As I said in another one of my reviews Ghirardelli Square was a legend of my youth and an icon in the world of chocolate confection and ice cream excellence I was here when I was but a lad I came here as young man And now as father I still have a gleam in my eye when I see this place If you are doing a tour of the stirp this is one of the must stop visits to one of the great shrines of sweets across the world This place is smaller and more compact compared to the Original Ghirardelli Square Ice Cream  Chocolate Shop but it has all the important fixings of the original The store is split right down the middle with chocolate on your right and the ice cream fountain on your left Unlike the original the lines are not super long and most of the time you can just order at the counter and find a seat without much competition Be patient as some folks have never been to any Ghiradelli shops ever so this experience will be overwhelming to chocolate loving n00bs Theyre going to gawk and talk and ooo and awe like we all did as they stand in front of the trying to make up their minds which ice cream or if theyve gotten all the chocolates they can because theyre probably from out of town and quite possibly not from this country It is Vegas baby  The atmosphere is comfortable and clean Sorry no chocolate making show here Youll have to make the trek to its Mecca in San Francisco for that I shared a Crissy Field again Its a big sundae and one their most prominent to date The prices are steep for sure 11 for a sundae but you come here expecting that because youre at Ghirardellis and its all part of the experience The Crissy Field is an amazing sundae with three scoops of premium ice cream topped with cookie crumbles whip cream and their famous milk chocolate squares The presentation is beautiful and the taste still blows me away When youre done with your ice cream treat check out the chocolate section hanging out filling the entire right side of the store Their entire selection can be had at various quantities The packaging and display is confectionery perfect just like Ghirardelli Square And because youre visiting get flavors and treats that are not available in your neighborhood Youll be glad you did Whats my bottom line Good Better than good Im coming back on my next visit My actual rating is a solid 50 stars because a chocolate god with its own ice cream joint No chocolate making show here but its still the force of is strong in this one,positive,483,300- 500,2618,2000+
I tried the birthday cake truffles decent and the confetti cookie dry and flavorless My husband had the cereal milk soft serve and could only stand a couple bites because the crunchy cereal they put on the outside was salty beyond belief Definitely disappointing as this was a place weve been dying to try for a long time,negative,58,50-75,331,<500

I love this place I went and loaded my tray so high I couldnt see over my pastries The milk pudding is amazing and a customer recommended the salted caramel iced coffee and OMG it was the best iced coffee Ive ever had My suggestion is to try everything its all excellent The only problem is once you go you become an addict,positive,63,50-75,336,<500
This ice cream is the BEST We wait every holiday for the peppermint ice cream and it never disappoints And the double chocolate or chocolate chunk I think thats the name is out of this world You cant go wrong,positive,40,25-50,216,<500

Worst manager Ive ever met at Sprinkles I think her name was Jessie or Jessica She had a very snarky attitude and rolled her eyes at me once I asked if there was anyone above her that I could speak to WILL NEVER VISIT THE LAS VEGAS LOCATION AGAIN ,negative,50,25-50,252,<500
One time is enough for me Place is all hype Taste wise other bakeries or homemade ones can be better They are instagrammable but they dont click to me palate wise My opinion,negative,33,25-50,181,<500
The place was beautifully decorated but thats about where my stars end The cake wasnt bad but ones we tried werent very good and there werent a lot of options I got sweet potato with a mocha icing I love sweet potato and it was basically a dense sweet potato loaf The icing was a really thick cream like you could peel the whole layer of icing off at once They both tasted okay on their own but didnt go very well together and both were too heavy for my tastes My boyfriend got chocolate cake with chocolate icing and it was okay but just kind of meh Nothing to write home about I mightve given it 3 stars except there was also a high pitched buzzing noise inside that was giving me a headache No reason to go back,negative,140,100-150,730,500-1000
I do not understand the reviews on here This place is all a hype Do not waste your time and money here Ordered red velvet ice cream that tasted like pure chocolate ice cream with red food coloring The texture was strange somewhat grainy I also ordered a slice of birthday cake This has to be the worst slice of cake that I have ever had and the slice cost 14 I took a few bites and straight to the garbage it went If youre looking for something sweet district donuts is just across and much better I will never eat from Milk nor do I recommend it to anyone,negative,110,100-150,571,500-1000
UPDATED REVIEW  The 2 young women who own this vegan doughnut shop are the sweetest They are truly passionate about their business It is so awesome to see a black owned business in Lakewood I am always greeted with a smile and I feel welcomed anytime I come here Now that Ive tried other doughnuts in the Cleveland area I will say that these are tasty They are soft but actually a bit too sweet It is almost as if you can taste the sugar I especially feel this when I taste the Lavender doughnut These are vegan doughnuts so they are made without milk I do appreciate that the price has gone down from 3 a doughnut to 2 a doughnut which is affordable I will be back here but the hours here are still limited They are opened Fridays  Sundays,positive,144,100-150,759,500-1000
Smaller than the 85 C Im used to but honestly had a very great selection There were actually a couple items that I hadnt seen before Line can be kinda long depending on when you go and I wish they could somehow space the bread display things more effectively so everyone isnt back to back One of the people I was with had never had it before so we obviously had to get some of my favorites like the Boroh Bun aka Pineapple Bun aka a sweet fluffy normal bun topped a cookie like crust thats shaped like a pineapple with the criss crosses The one filled with cream is also very good I also like the milk custard bun with the heart on it The egg tarts are also very good here,positive,133,100-150,685,500-1000
Where do I even start to begin to explain the explosion of flavor is in my mouth This is a very unique place very glad to have found this in Phoenix wonderful choices of ice cream handcrafted ice cream The owner took his time to explain all the delicious choices of ice cream he has to offer definitely makes you want to come back so many flavors,positive,67,50-75,348,<500
Everything was frozen rock hard since nothing is baked here in Las Vegas ugh and the serving sizes are a joke for the price I was so disappointed because I was so looking forward to them finally coming here Only thing that was ok when thawed was the crack pie but even then the slice was big enough for a three year old child SUPER tiny,negative,66,50-75,342,<500
This place is super cute The cupcake ATM is nothing short of genius The coolness factor alone made the trip to Sprinkles worth it The frosting is a little on the greasy side Otherwise really good Try it out,positive,39,25-50,212,<500
Ughhhh butter pecan ice cream is the best ice cream I have ever eaten I dont think Ive ever ordered butter pecan in my life but one sample spoon bite changed my life I got a single scoop of it which was surprisingly big Halfway through eating it I started getting nauseous because I was already really full from dinner But I kept eating and now Im laying in bed dealing with the consequences of my gluttony Worth Every Bite Butter pecan salty sweet creamy Lots of pecans They had a slight popcorn taste which was cool Salted chocolate chunk cookie chewy with crispy edges and a really nice salted taste Also one of the best cookies Ive gotten at an ice cream shop Please go,positive,126,100-150,696,500-1000
Wow Talk about falling off I recently purchased a bunch of macarons some tarts some pastries etc and ALL of them tasted exactly the same Like old state desserts Their macarons definitely do not taste like the flavor theyre advertising Big disappointment I would not call this an authentic French bakery,negative,51,50-75,313,<500
How can a famous and really good Chocolate and Ice Cream shop possibly get a 1 star review Read on We had a craving for the brownie sundae and a lava cake We had been here before so there was no hesitation to come out this way from where we were staying We were wrong After a LONG wait only 1 cashier open we were informed they have been out of brownies for 2 weeks and they no longer have lava cake even though they have a picture of it on the wall We got the regular sundae which is normally really good Not so much this time Something is off I understand Covid and the issues it has presented to employers but the attitude by the employees was awful After ordering and while waiting we did some shopping for the chocolates We purchased some bulk nonpareilsThe container we used did not close properly We asked the employee and her response was yes we know those dont close properly but we have a sticker I doubted a sticker would keep a plastic container closed so I asked if we could use another container She said yes but they would charge me for another container So they knowingly give out defective containers and then want to charge for another container What I guess it is another revenue stream sort of like checked baggage fees at the airline or resort fees at the hotels So I passed and waited to pay and I had to stand in line again as they couldnt wouldnt ring me up at the gift register After another 20 min wait in line got the nonpareils and thankfully put them in a bag Why thankfully you ask well the sticker didnt hold and the candies went out of the aforementioned defective plastic container and into the bag Not sure what happened this time at this location but we will be hesitant to return Locals and Tourists beware,negative,329,300- 500,1805,1500-2000
WellI know that I wont convince many to stay away from this local institution but if I can convince one it will make my night better I waited in line for 1 hour and was at least 20 min away from getting served when I left Yes it was Moms weekend and they wee mobbed but there is such an indifference to the way they do business that I am hoping to convince anyone that reads this review STAY AWAY The same person who takes the order makes the order There are only 4 people working here and the lines are back to the street The counter person takes the order walk toward the back with no sense of urgency slowly fills the cup talks to his coworker for 30 seconds goes to the topping area same indifference to the 70100 people in line finally gets back to he counter and ask the same person what they want next God forbid he couldve made 2 at the same time The owners couldnt care less that there far better ways to do things Hire 3 more people One person takes orders and money another makes the order The time would be cut b 30 And heres another idea the teenage workers should actually be managed Hurry just a little dont talk to your coworkers if one of your friends comes to the window dont spend 3 mi asking about his life etc CARE ABOUT THE CUSTOMER But the owner clearly doesnt care about his customers because they wait and wait and wait Except for one Yes I wasted an hour but you didnt get my money because you didnt are enough to earn it The service is HORRIBLE because the owner has a screw the customer they can wait instead of me spending more money attitude,negative,305,300- 500,1628,1500-2000
I always enjoy Milk Bar The soft serve is amazing I havent tried anything else The cereal milk one and fruity cereal are both so delish I like getting it with cereal and sprinkles both I havent tried their other dessert but next time Ill do one of the milkshakes,positive,50,25-50,271,<500

very lack luster whats the big deal  The buttercream frosting and I use that term LOOSELY  is more like crisco cream frosting and lets forget about the salted carmel brownies they are NOT what they use to be  sorry Amelies I wont go back  I will stick with Novas Bakeries in Charlotte,negative,56,50-75,297,<500
Wow Some of the richest most decadent donuts Ive ever had My favorite was the maple glazed The place is small but the taste is big,positive,26,25-50,135,<500
This place was absolutely terrific My sister had seen them on social media and so we thought we would give it a try As soon as we walked in we were warmly greeted by the friendly workers who were more than willing to answer my never ending questions They were eager to let us try as many flavors as we wanted and they were super helpful in making the final ice cream decision I would most definitely recommend this place to anyone who is an ice cream lover,positive,88,75-100,462,<500
Great ice cream every time Churn makes their ice cream with real ingredients and it shows in their product If you are getting ice cream for more than one person go for a multiscoop bowl It will save you som cah,positive,41,25-50,217,<500
Very disappointing The Fig Bacon and Brie Tartine was made with fig jam  thats not the same as figs Our quiche was undercooked The coffee was luke warm and bitter We asked for hot coffee and the server quipped It was made 20 minutes ago We tried to improve it with cream and the server was defensive and rude about it We dumped the lousy brew and went to Starbucks  not my favorite place but their coffee was hot theyre consistent in their product offering and Starbucks cares about their customers There are plenty of other places that appreciate our dining dollars,negative,104,100-150,585,500-1000
Visiting on business trip and looked for a good ice cream place Well I found it Ice cream was great The gentleman that helped us very friendly and helped us with picking a flavor by giving us a sample of the ice cream My husband had brownie swirl and almond butter crunch in a waffle cone I have a scoop of almond butter crunch and salted butter crunch in a cup I had a bit of my husbands and I was wishing I had a waffle cone too Best ice cream and definitely the best waffle cone I have ever had Cant wait to visit here again,positive,107,100-150,538,500-1000
Its just a hype and I dont know why The salespeople are moving very slow so it will built a longer line I spent almost 100 just try a few of them but I was so disappointed save your hard earned cash  not worth it,negative,46,25-50,220,<500
Not sure why we keep going back thinking the service will change We try to be supportive of locally owned businesses but today was my last visit There always seems to be a disconnect from the point of the order taken to being delivered More often than not we have to have our order remade or we just suck it up and chalk it up to a loss Today we simply ordered a couple double espressos as she flings them down half of one spills all over the coaster She looks down at it says nothing and casually walks away Last time I ordered a cappuccino specifically asked to make sure its in a glass cup so it stays hot They place it in a paper cup I call them out on it Their response is that were out of glass cups So tell me Id get an iced coffee instead,negative,151,150-200,767,500-1000
i walk in and theres a full grown big dog in the store Since when So dogs come before people I am afraid of dogs they super scare me and usually I have mace with me to keep animals away from me This place is too small for patrons and dogs Service dogs is one thing but this was not a service dog you could tell because it was not behaving and not following its owners commands I had to leave immediately,negative,82,75-100,412,<500
I had the dough melt this time I got the butter pecan ice cream with crunch berry toppings The donut was perfect and wasnt overly sweet and the butter pecan went really well with the crunch berries I highly recommend getting a dough melt when you come by Next up on my todo list will be the Leslie Knope a waffle ice cream sandwich,positive,64,50-75,340,<500
Let me just go into this review saying I had such high hopes for these cupcakes Unfortunately these were the worst cupcakes Ive ever had Both the vanilla cake and chocolate cake were very dry and lacked overall flavor The frosting was overly sweet and cheap tasting like a bad grocery store bakery I cant imagine the specialty flavored would be much better since the two most basic flavors were such a flop,negative,73,50-75,413,<500
First time here I love it Very interesting flavors ex Fruity pebble Bluemoon The texture and taste is amazing Super Cute place I Definitely recommend,positive,25,<50,158,<500
Amelies is really going downhill  We used to adore this place  Food quality service understaffed  has all gone down  Maybe ego is the issue maybe time for them to get a competitor so they care again Only reason for two stars is some pastries are still yummy  My chai latte was water downed yuck,negative,59,50-75,313,<500
Favorite ice cream spot hands down Really happy its located at my side of town Rarely order ice cream but when I crave it I get my fix here,positive,29,25-50,144,<500
My kids have watched every episode of cake boss as well as his reality tv show for the next great cake boss We were so excited to experience the bakery while visiting Vegas The cake we bought was horrible It was stale and dry The cakes at the local supermarkets are better I will never visit again My kids didnt even eat their dessert,negative,64,50-75,342,<500
Definitely definitely worth standing in line for it The ice cream is absolutely delicious Its creamy it taste amazing and the service is excellent I was really thinking about making the line but it kind of went by really really fast taking into consideration the amount of people that were in line I have a coffee ice cream and it literally taste like a cafÃ con leche Definitely worth it,positive,70,50-75,396,<500
I always go for the chocolate mouse It has a very rich dark chocolate flavor with a tart strawberry on top to balance There is a nice selection of macarons The ambience is very hipster yet youll see many different types of people Its a place that brings people together for what everyone loves most sweets,positive,56,50-75,314,<500
Oh Sprinkles you were such a disappointment Everyone raved about you I love cupcakes We were supposed to be a match made in heaven but you were an awkward first and second date First and foremost there are two doors Ice Cream Orders and Cupcake Orders If you order only cupcakes you can enter the other door I was smart enough to ask As it was about 11 PM at night the line was still a bit long and the cupcakes were sparse The counter staff was friendly pleasant and informative I like that Sprinkles offers both traditional vegan and glutenfree options I like that there is a Cupcake ATM for afterhours cupcake delights I guarantee the drunken twacked out people watching is 24k gold Sprinkles is overhyped and overpriced sadcupcakeface,negative,131,100-150,766,500-1000
Im a huge fan of Churn so it was hard to break away and try a new place but I wasnt disappointed Melt is a very cute ice cream shop a few houses down from and also owned by JoBot They had a lot of flavours Id never seen before and I was able to try a few before choosing I love that moms mint chip ice cream came in a Chinese food carton with a fortune cookie I got my half blueberry muffinhalf birthday cake scoop in a waffle cone  it didnt have the waffle pattern and was pretty thick so its more like a pancake cone  and both the ice cream and cone were delicious Then surprise there were little marshmallows on the bottom of my cone to I assume keep ice cream from sliding out the bottom but was also a nice extra treat Two scoops with a waffle cone was just under 10 Not bad for homemade and local,positive,165,150-200,829,500-1000
We wanted a pickmeup after enjoying a delicious lunch at Momofuku so we got an affogato next door The cereal milk soft serve pairs perfectly with the rich espresso and tasted even better when all mixed together I would recommend getting the cereal milk flavor over the crack pie since the latter is pretty sweet and wouldnt go as well with the espresso It made for a delicious treat and gave us the extra caffeine boost we needed,positive,78,75-100,438,<500
All I wanted was a good cannoli from here and I was extremely disappointed I go to the one in Orlando all the time and never have any of these problems First and the main reason I came was to get a cannoli They have zero and informed me that they havent had any for two days and wont be getting any more any time soon So how does this happen The girl had nothing to say Since they didnt have that I chose to have a cookie and it had a stale like taste to it and was horrible I dont know if I can trust Carlos bakery anymore which is a shame I was a huge fan,negative,119,100-150,571,500-1000
Meh My mom makes gooey bars better than the crack pie And the one cookie we had we ordered two but only got one for some reason was like a prepackaged cookie youd get at a gas station,negative,38,25-50,190,<500
Is this location owned by Buddy Well I was not impressed I purchased a cupcake and a cannoli the cupcake had no flavor was dry and stuck to the cup paper As for the cannoli it did not impress me tasted a bit stale Is this what Carlos bakery items really taste Like Cardboard Save your money go get a Ghirardelli ice cream sundae instead,negative,65,50-75,348,<500
The line here was shorter than the one I usually see back in Yountville CA  Croissant not bad  Epi baguette sadly stale  Chocolate almond croissant consistent with the Yountville one in terms of having a nice generous base layer of frangipane and chocolate and the almond crust on top was nice  Kouign amann too buttery and sweet compared to some other ones Ive had  Pistachio macaron standard When we asked for butter and got Grassland whipped butter packs it was disappointing I wasnt expecting Animal Farm but still The line was also pretty disorganized and they ended up charging us for a box of macarons and giving us the box of macarons in our large order when we never actually asked for it When we brought it to their attention they took it off but it took multiple attempts to place orders for them to get our stuff right,negative,154,150-200,856,500-1000
Love this place The owners are friendly and down to earth and the foods are delicious The tiramisu and the pimento cheese croissants are not to be missed,positive,28,25-50,156,<500
The donuts here are good theyre dense unlike a lot of other donut places You can really tell thy put effort in making them However the creme brulee donut was very disappointing The hype did not match the quality I think people were just excited about the cracking noise rather than its taste However the other donuts were great,positive,59,50-75,338,<500
I had high expectations and I was disappointed The pastries were super hard not moist at all and the prices are  WTF Wont be going again EEk me thinks nope,negative,31,25-50,166,<500
While the ice cream looked delicious  there was no frozen yogurt I was led astray But this place sure is popular  the line was out the door I am on a quest for a local yogurt joint  not sure why Yelp lists this as both a yogurt  ice cream shop,negative,54,50-75,251,<500
I was speechless Everyone was so friendly and helpful There are so many to choose from I had to take it all in for a minute Then I went crazy It will be a staple in my Vegas trips no doubt,positive,41,25-50,192,<500
Being from out of town I never heard of Jack Frost Donuts but wanted to take a treat to my customer in Walton Hills When I walked in with these I became a hero  These were creative and beautiful and the taste was better than any I have had anywhere Loved it,positive,53,50-75,263,<500
This place use to be good Their cookie cup was the best But the new owner decided to change it to a cheaper version just one macaron instead of two and two sorry scoops of ice cream But she decided to keep the prices the same I miss the enthusiastic kids that used to greet you when you walked in So long fatty daddys,negative,64,50-75,324,<500
Sad I wanted to like this place This review is for the macarons I had two mint choc chip and passion fruit First of all I think they are too large In my opinion macarons should be a bit smaller unless youre absolutely sure you can get them right The ratio of cookie to filling was too high which made them a bit dry The mint choc chip was decently flavored but it reminded me a bit of toothpaste The cookie was a bit too mushy The passion fruit was a disaster The filling tasted like buttery egg and it was only very very slightly passionfruity All in all these are low on the list of macarons for me and they were also the most expensive by volume Save your money and try something else if you fancy yourself a true macaron lover,negative,143,100-150,753,500-1000
1st timer I ordered the special HaloHalo and it was amazing Very friendly people and chill vibe were from Mesa but we dont mind the drive Well be back,positive,29,25-50,162,<500

Granted we arrived at 2pm on a Saturday and granted we expected there to be a waitbut oh boy was there a wait We were number 71 and they were only on 40 We got lucky soon after when someone gave us their number 57 They had had enough and said thats it were outta here So from 40 to 57 was an hour Ok we waited no biggie A few points the place is small and its so crowded that you will not be able to look at any display cases without pushingshoving your way to the front there is bar next store where you can get a cocktail while you are waiting although not sure if you would be able to hear them calling numbers the cake itself was a grocery store cake for all intents and purposesgood but nothing special whatsoever and definitely not worth an hour plus wait in chaos the cake was 28 which is well above grocery store prices but cheap in comparison to real authentic bakeries We gave into the gimmick and glad we did Its a new Vegas sightnot a must have in terms of cake but put it on the list in case you are ever there with kids Its now checked off the listone and done,negative,216,200-250,1126,1000-1500
Donut Bar home of the biggest donuts Ive ever seen They are pretty darned tasty too I have visited here a few times The service is always friendly and there is always many choices My favorite is the chocolate euphoria Chocolate curls delicious frosting and light fluffy donut Todays visit I got a mud pie lemon pistachio and cake batter The lemon pistachio was refreshing The glaze was light and just tart enough It had a sprinkling of pistachios Perfect balance The mud pie was chocolaty deliciousness I didnt try the cake batter but it did look yummy I recommend Donut Bar for a sweet treat Bring your friends though because the size definitely makes them shareable,positive,117,100-150,693,500-1000
Decided to try this out because of the hype around it The corn flake flavored soft serve ice cream is certainly not worth the 600 they charge If you want it sprinkled with some corn flakes be prepared to fork out an additional 250 for a few cornflakes The crack pie flavored soft serve was better but maybe not worth 600 for a small portion,negative,65,50-75,352,<500
I went to the West Side Market on a Saturday morning when I was in town for my sisters wedding I had heard about the crepes and wanted to get one for breakfast I walked around a bit during a very busy Saturday morning at WSM and finally found the crepe stand I could tell it was a very long line and thought it must be worth it They have the longest line here As I checked in on Yelp I was surprised to see that their overall review wasnt that high Well alas now I see why For starters I know it was a busy Saturday morning Memorial Day Weekend but there is only one associate working making crepes and she can only make two at a time I know West Side Market doesnt have much space but due to the 2 crepe at a time max this line moves INCREDIBLY slow To the right of it is the coffee and tea stand I could tell those associates get annoyed because the line gets so long it backs up into the line for their stand as well One coffee associate yelled If youre in line for a crepe move to the right Youre blocking the line Ugh what a mess Anyways I waited for roughly 30 mins which is sad because I was about the 5th person in line I honestly waited for so long that I changed my mind about three times about what I was going to order At first I wanted something sweet maybe strawberry banana and nutella but after waiting so darn long I was super hungry and knew I needed protein I took a look at the board and opted for the Complete crepe which came with ham eggs and cheese When my crepe was FINALLY ready the associate handed it to me in a cute flat cone Although cute and Instagram worthy it wasnt really practical This thing is piping hot and even with the paper and cardboard its very hot to hold Its also difficult to take bites out of without almost taking a bite of the paper as well I will say my crepe was pretty good The first half of it I definitely enjoyed But what makes this place two stars for me is that as I got to the bottom of the crepe this thing was COVERED in oilgrease It was disgusting I didnt even watch the associate put any grease anywhere as she was making it but it was completely soaked at the bottom It made me feel so gross and it was dripping everywhere even on my new Lululemon shorts insert eyeroll I would just much rather have a regular crepe served to me on a plate instead of this greaseball meal Unfortunately I do not think I would go back because all I think about is my hands and everything else covered in grease It was just gross If they could get that figured out then Id be open to trying it again All in all not worth the wait,negative,514,500+,2654,2000+
My wife saw Milk Bar all over social media and had to try Overall the presentation was nice and it is in Cosmopolitan so dont expect decent pricing We ordered the soft serve with and without the corn flake topping 4 cookies and the birthday cake balls We were disappointed all I can say is that it tastes like super salty dessert Just overloaded with salt We werent expecting great things but few things are more frustrating than paying a lot of money for bad food The cookies and cake balls were ok but again too much salt and you can get better desserts else where in Las Vegas like Crumbl or try one of the many bakeries in China Town Im giving two stars because the soft serve with the corn flake topping was good but it was horrible without the topping We ended up throwing away half of what we ordered it was not good and waayyyyy too salty If you like salty desserts then by all means but it wasnt for me There are so many better places in Vegas for desserts I will never go back to Milk Bar,negative,193,150-200,1026,1000-1500
They have lots of employees but service is too slow They need to improve efficiency Didnt like the way the phone customers we instantly put on hold Carlos Bakery please hold You ASK your customers to hold not tell them Got 2 cannolis  they were alright,negative,47,25-50,264,<500
I was really excited to use the cupcake ATM which was really cool but the cupcakes really sucked The cupcakes were really dry The cake crumbled and the frosting was hard and too sweet There are much better places to get dessert so dont waste your money on this place,negative,50,25-50,271,<500
I am a 90s kid Urkel on the wall Here for it Blasting some smoothe 90s beats oh bring it But the 90s here didnt translate into 2022 The staff they did their job but werent friendly My dunkaroo shake oh yeah I had dunkaroos in my lunchbox as a kid was great in theory but the frosting kept getting stuck in my straw It was not blended as well It wasnt smooth I did not like taking sips and being hit with a too sweet gob of frosting if it made it through the straw A place like this should be about the experience and the product The experience wasnt hyped and the product fell short,negative,117,100-150,607,500-1000
This is probably my favorite ice cream spot in Scottsdale Every time I come here its such an indulgent experience Everything is awesome everything is fresh everything is so scrumptious There so many different flavors and combinations you could sit here and just try to figure out what you want for several hours and then even then it will be hard to decide The people are always really super friendly and the service is always great You cant walk out of here and not be happy,positive,86,75-100,483,<500
The vegan chocolate ice cream was so good I bought a pint to go probably the best nondairy Ive cream Ive ever had The kids loved their dairy ice cream flavors as well and think its the best ice cream in Charlotte  in their opinion probably only bested by the Creamery at Penn State State College PA,positive,58,50-75,314,<500
I was so excited to have a cupcake from Carlos bakery because on tv they make it seem like they are the best in the whole world so I figured I would try them I had a red velvet and a peanut butter chocolate cupcakeI was quite disappointed actually It wasnt by far any better than cupcakes at my local bakery  Sift ,negative,64,50-75,322,<500

This was some sensation ice cream Jenis really hit the spot after i had dinner at Hawkers Im not usual much of a dessert person but this ice cream is something special I had the strawberry ice cream and it was delicious The strawberry was cut into nice little chunks so the flavor wasnt overwhelming The waffle cone was just crunchy enough but not too brittle,positive,66,50-75,368,<500

Went around 9pm service was great parking was a bit of a chore but was a great find as I got lost while driving and decided to stop to eat,positive,30,25-50,142,<500
The pastries are perfect pricy but perfect They are not too sweet which is great because you really taste quality ingredients rather than having something overwhelmed of just sugar It is the only place locally I was able to find a sfogliatella They also make a great slice of cheesecake and their turnovers are excellent as well Although I am very shy and say nothing coming in I get a warm good morning greeting walking in,positive,76,75-100,431,<500
Sorry Buddy We love you We have watched all your shows and feel like we know you and your family But customer service at you Bakery in Las Vegas is the worst We waited patiently to get our treats My kids had your cupcakes and cookies I asked for the eclairs which all are delicious My husband order your famous cannoli and when we open our order the cannoli were missing When we went back the girl who ring me didnt believe me We showed them the order minus the cookies and cupcakes my kids had already eaten We were treated like criminals After so much back and forth and showing our receipt and many dirty looks we got the cannolis The most bitter cannolis we have eaten in our lives Not going back to the Vegas location,negative,138,100-150,738,500-1000
I know donuts by god if theres one thing Ive accomplished in this world its a palette for donuts VooDoo Dynamo Bobs SF Blue Star  Donut Friend Ive conquered them all  I have to say this place is comfortably in the same stratosphere of its brethren I hate the word Artisanal especially when it comes to donuts but this place is pretty fancy as it comes to ingredients and style of donuts Stump town coffee  yummy selections such as Nuttella donut with chopped hazelnuts on top Maple bacon bar the Homer for those of you that remember the Michael Jackson Simpsons episode We paid 27 for 2 coffees 1 bottle water  7 fancy kine doughnuts Yes winchells or Krispy Kreme is like 68 for a dozen but why do you hate yourself Pay up and treat yourself,positive,141,100-150,774,500-1000
Decided to go with my daughter to Scooptopia which she has been raving about for the last month Its a charming little place with a pretty wide selection of offerings My daughter had a small shaved ice Altho small is a relative term  it was huge and I had chocolate covered strawberry ice cream that was to die for Staff was very friendly and attentive and he made us feel welcomed I love little neighborhood places like this and I hope to come around more often,positive,87,75-100,474,<500
Holy crap Im hesitant to declare anything the best but this is seriously the best ice cream Ive ever had I ordered one scoop Chocolate Pecan one scoop Banana on a waffle cone I love waffle cones but theyre also the more structurally sound choice herethe scoops are really too large to be adequately supported on the regular sugar cone Flavor full and with real ingredients The banana scoop had actual bits of banana and tasted like real banana The chocolate pecan had entire salted pecan halves embedded throughout creamy rich semisweet chocolate Sweetness not cloying or overwhelminghoney really does give just the right amount of sweetness Texture not too hard but not too soft didnt melt easily refreshing creamy with slightly icy texture without inducing brain freeze Price one order comes with 2 generous scoops for under 4 Crowd I went on a Sunday night the lines were pretty long but it moved fairly quickly This is a real momandpop gem no chain can ever replicate The quality even tops my alltime storebought favorites Ben and Jerrys and MÃvenpick I only wish there were a way to send a couple quarts back to my peeps in LA Ill definitely be back to try the monthly special flavorscant wait till October to try their cinnamon pumpkin and coffee scoops,positive,219,200-250,1308,1000-1500
i found this place on a map search it has no sign when i last went and you dont really notice it When i walked in i thought it was really cute nice and CLEAN There were some nice looking treats and was going to order some until i seen Flies sitting on their food I told the people that work there that there were flies on their food items and nothing was done they just kept the food there They need to invest in those glass covers if they havent already done so If i didnt experience this then i would have given it a better rating,negative,108,100-150,544,500-1000
Cute store variety of flavors cute concept with the Chinese togo boxes  fortune cookie on top But poor customer service The chubby white girl with the septum piercing was really rude She didnt smile at us barely responded to our questions and just looked really bored The cashier was unhelpful and walked away when more people behind us came And finally the ice cream wasnt that good birthday cake  Nutella  melted once she scooped it onto the box container,negative,82,75-100,477,<500
I enjoyed my Sprinkles cupcakes  I ordered the salty caramel dark chocolate  black and white They had a promotion going on where you buy two  can get a free cupcake with purchase on your next visit but the employee was sweet enough to let my sis  I get there at the time We are out of towners so she acknowledged that The dark chocolate cupcake is fantastic Very pricey but good cupcakes,positive,76,75-100,399,<500
I was so excited to go here but that excitement soon turned to disappointment We had never been to a Carlos Bakery in person and we are fans of Buddy of course so we had to go while in Vegas We waited in a decently long line which gave us time to look at all the things that were wrong with this place The display cases were filthy and messy Frosting sprinkles and crumbs were everywhere There were even some cupcakes that had fallen upside down that just laid there in the case looking oh so sad Several of the trays were empty one of those being cannolis One of the main reasons we wanted to go to Carlos was was to try one of their famous cannolis Sadly that didnt happen Mind you this was in the middle of the day It wasnt like we were there 10 minutes til close On top of that the food that was in the case was not properly labeled Many things had no labels at all This can be dangerous for folks with food allergies and annoying to other people trying to communicate what they want to the workers We ended up getting a lobster tail and a napoleon type thing a layered cake no sign so who knows what it was The lobster tails tasted stale and like it had sat in a fridge for a week The cake thing was just not good The flavor was not good I took one bite of each and wished I had spent that 20 on a slot machine instead of desserts that walmart can do better than I really hope Buddy and his family get a handle on things and get their locations back in shape because I dont think this is the quality they had in mind for their customers,negative,308,300- 500,1582,1500-2000
My wife and I went to Amelies last night for desert and had a horrible experience My wife ordered a chi latte and the chocolate mousse cup and I the apple turnover The chocolate mousse cup had a chocolate strawberry on top but when you bite into it it was so soggy and gross Also she found fruit flies in it The chi latte was also gross and not drinkable My apple turnover was more so filled with apple sauce then actual chopped apples Overall a very bad experience and we wont be going there again Not to mention we spend 20 when we could have gone someplace else for much cheaper,negative,112,100-150,594,500-1000
Pretty disappointed in this place Id been wanting to try milk bar for a very long time A single slice of cake here was 15 I was expecting higher prices given were in a casino I was not expecting the cake to taste like it was made from a Betty Crocker box Overall very bummed Would be very curious to know if the cake tastes the same at other locations,negative,70,50-75,362,<500
Who doesnt love Ghiraradelli  This Vegas location is across from in and out near the Ferris wheel I shared a brownie sundae with my husband its super sweet and rich but delightful The brownies were soft and baked with goodness Three scoops of vanilla ice cream with placed on top of the warm brownies and a chocolate syrup to drizzled on top We were able to use our yelp discount with no problem Also when entering we were greeted with a free chocolate square pretty much their signature greeting The location is a nice size plenty of tables to sit and enjoy your ice cream The service was quick and friendly and everything looked really nice and clean,positive,119,100-150,668,500-1000
Snow flurries in April but Im kicking off spring vibes with my first Honey Hut visit of the season Be warned youre exposed to the elements walking up to the order window the patio is out in the open not covered but its absolutely worth it for the delicious creamy ice cream Its made with  you guessed it  honey And the patio is a great spot to hang out and enjoy when the sun is out Honey Hut has all the standard ice cream flavor favorites youre looking for as well as some lesscommon treats like banana orange blossom and coconut They also keep it interesting with great monthly flavor specials Get your scoops in a cup or cone or make it a sundae and add lots of toppings You can also get your flavors blended in a milkshake smoothie or twister which is like a DQ blizzard Our go tos I love the peanut butter cup sundae hot fudge peanut butter sauce and lots of chopped up Reeses cups over vanilla ice cream topped with whipped cream Hubbie goes for the Oreo twister And pup takes whatever she can get Whichever flavor you choose Im confident youll love it Thats why this place is an Old Brooklyn mustvisit every summer,positive,213,200-250,1175,1000-1500

Was wanting to get chocolaye chip cookies all gone cant believe it because its always busy you think theyed make more so i got 2 mm cookies very stale and double chocolate chip also stale all for over 11 so disappointed im deciding if i should walk back and complain but maybe ill just suck it up and never buy there again and taste like box cookies,negative,67,50-75,350,<500
I had been wanting to go into this sweet shop for some time and had a chance to go this week after dining at Bakersfield We opted for some truffles since we really like truffles who doesnt  We chose mango mint milk and dark espresso Bulleit Bourbon and Key Lime The consistency was not that of a truffle The inside was more of a fudgelike consistency and they were colored light green orangeetc inside They were very sugary and grainy instead of silky and smooth Most truffles I have eaten do not have coloring they are simply flavored within the chocolate We were highly disappointed and I actually only tried one bite of each and then did not eat anymore There were many delectables in the display cases and they had great presentation The woman behind the counter was very helpful and was able to box them up nicely for us I did not try any of the other treats or ice cream so if I go back I will just have to try something other than the truffles,negative,180,150-200,972,500-1000
As a frequent guest at the VenetianPalazzo we always try to squeeze in a stop to Carlos Bakery for a Lobster Tail and coffee While all of the pastriesdesserts look so deliciously tempting the Lobster Tail is our favorite ever since we first had it on an NCL cruise I must say that I find a surprising lack of good friendly service at this Grand Canal Shops location We usually go there midmorning after the early morning rush is done While the counter attendants are quick to serve us it seems as though they are just going thru the motions and cant wait to return to their chatting with their behindthecounter coworkers We always order coffees and ask for cream  I dont understand why theres no cream or half  half at the sugarmixing counter like their competition Or at least have those small disposable containers of cream available at the register They keep the cream in a fridge under the coffee brewer and even if I request to pour my own cream they always insist on pouring it behind the counter Everyone has their own preference as to how much cream they want  these servers either pour way too much or not enough and we always need to ask for a coffee redo or more cream The workers then react as if Im the one that messed up the coffee in the first place or as if Im asking for too much On our last visit 112817 when I asked for more cream the guy told me that they ran out  Too bad we love the products but in Vegas theres many other options,negative,278,250-300,1497,1000-1500
SKIP IT I definitely understand the negative reviews while the shop itself is cute and enticing the customer service is terrible Its like no one in there has any idea what is goin on and they all look so confused and lost Our very simple single item order was wrong and had to be made over Its absolute chaos in there when trying to order and the prices highportions ridiculously tiny are outrageous Our 9 small was about a 4 oz Serving of ice cream about a half cup Initially when reading the reviews I thought to myself Can it really be THAT bad  and OMG it IS  The ice cream flavors are decent but no better than dryerseddys quality wise and there are plenty of other options for a more amazingly sinful treat just around the corner Try Black Tap downstairs WAY better quality and their prices seem dirt cheap by comparison for what you get in a loaded shakeand bonus you have a place to sit and have a delish cocktail andor a snack while the kiddos have their delicious treat,negative,184,150-200,1026,1000-1500
This place has really gone downhill I went tonight expecting the fun flavors they had before but half of the ice cream display was closed I was only able to choose from a small handful of flavors and some of them were melted And it was a chilly January night The place was pretty empty on a Friday night with only a couple other tables taken and they painted over the cool mural inside They even removed the paletero cart outside Its definitely not the fun hang out spot like it was before Ill give it two stars for the delicious and still frozen fruity pebbles ice cream just like before Other than that its just not worth the drive for me,negative,122,100-150,657,500-1000
I love The Vegan Doughnut Company If you didnt know these donuts were vegan you might never know Im not a vegan but I sought them out once at a festival precovid because I wanted to see what the hype was about I completely understand now why the line was wrapped around the building and up the street Again these doughnuts dont have some strange vegany aftertaste To me they taste just like the real deal full of gluteny goodness My favorite flavor is the Lemon Lavender These sisters make some truly delightful doughnuts in excellent flavors Youre also supporting a local nonchain blackowned biz and some really awesome ladies I have yet to visit their actual brickandmortar in Lakewood but I certainly plan to once the pandemic improves Dont wait Get there early or youll miss out Follow them on social media and youll always be intheknow on the rotating flavors and status of the shop Afterall they sell out regularly A true Cleveland gem,positive,166,150-200,981,500-1000
Went to Milk Bar after eating at Momofuku in Las Vegas Was excited to after seeing in on TV and how she got started in David Changs kitchen We got the layered confetti cake and 3 cookies Cookies were great but the cake was frozen and then defrosted you could tell Taste was okay but the moistness and freshness was not there I so wanted to love this because of the owners story and creativeness but walked away not impressed Id rather go to the local Nothin Bundt Cakes in my area as they are always fresh and moist Or at least they have figured out how keeps things fresher if they had to freeze them Overall just okay and not worth a return trip,negative,125,100-150,660,500-1000

Ive had Milks cookies from New York before and thought they were pretty good but I was so excited to try the soft serve ice creams Located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan right next door to Momofoku Milk Bar is hard not to miss with their bright signage We came here on a Friday night and surprisingly the line was short with about 4 people ahead of us My cousin and I both got the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch I also got cookies to take home to my son Honestly the cereal milk soft serve tasted like milk that had gone bad And it did not mix well with the saltiness of the cornflakes The cornflakes were much harder than an average cornflake it was more like hard granola and it was put on the top and the bottom of the soft serve I got tired of it real quick After three bites both my cousin and I threw it out What a waste of money  for 750 each we should have just shared one It was really disappointing    As for the prepackaged cookies its also pricey  4 each or 6 for 22 I ended up buying 6 and a tin to store them in The corn cookie was my fav  not too sweet and as buttery as the other flavors My son hated all the flavors so that was also a waste of money Totally underwhelmed  maybe it tastes better in New York but here in Vegas its NOT worth the hype,negative,265,250-300,1327,1000-1500
It didnt live up to the hype I purchased a cupcake and a brownie Neither item was something that I would go back for The place was super crowded so I guess others disagree but I definitely think you can skip this during your trip Theres another bakery in the Venetian that I will try next time,negative,57,50-75,301,<500

Terrible and slow service There was 5 total people in line and we waited 30 mins to get a latte and coffee At least 4 people behind us got their drinks before us When we asked whats taking so long we simply got brushed off and the lady continued making her drink Surprising since we werent rude and they seemed to be friendly to everyone else What really sucks about this was we were in a hurry to get back to LA and what was suppose to be a quick coffee in a short line made us so late,negative,99,75-100,496,<500
No Bouchon Bakery you do not get to charge so much for such mediocre pastries I tried you over and over again out of proximity and necessity while I was here for CES and while you occasionally satisfied you almost always disappointed Plain croissant  dry Almond croissant  exterior dry interior too sweet Banana muffin  dry Turkey sandwich  decent Bouchons  decent Kouign Amann  good Its odd to me that Thomas Keller could let such substandard product go out day after day Neither location in the Venetian seemed popular and the presentation is fairly poor so I file the whole enterprise under a big why We mixed up our Bouchon with sandwiches and pastries from the food court several times and in all cases we did better there,negative,132,100-150,746,500-1000
We were very dissatisfied with the quality of the fooddesserts we got from here We were super excited to go to the Cake Bosss bakery but quickly became disappointed We all got one of the famous cannolis but found the filling to be a little gritty and not very flavorful The cannoli also left a greasy film in your mouth I got the carrot cake and my friend got the strawberry shortcake Both of our cakes were really dry and the only thing we ate was some of the icing and whipped cream I would definitely not recommend this place Save your money and go elsewhere,negative,106,100-150,573,500-1000

Fantastically amazing custard The cold fudge sundae with vanilla custard is my favorite thing on the menu The pumpkin pie snowstorm seasonal takes a close second We just discovered they sell frozen custard cookie sandwiches which are also yummy It seems like Jarlings is always open when we need to make a late night custard run around 9pm or so,positive,60,50-75,354,<500
Not to long ago I tried donut bar for the first time at the farmers market at downtown summerlin I enjoyed just about every single donut they had and the guy who had helped me pick out some of them was super nice and friendly So today I decided to drive from the other side of town to get some more of their donuts cause I enjoyed them so much the first time Well I got there first off the building is way to small they need to have a bigger space to walk People kept running into each to get to the line or from the line to check out Second off we were waiting in line and no one was helping us it seemed to be they were helping everyone around us including the people that were behind us Finally I had to ask someone to help us Third after I had gotten home I dug into the donuts and they werent as good I had bought some that I knew were good from my previous experience at downtown summerlin and some new ones to try I had gotten a maple bar how can someone mess up on a maple bar Honestly their donuts need more flavor The donut itself is amazing its soft and moist but they have lack of flavor from the fillings and from the frostings Honestly youd be better off going to a grocery store than here,negative,243,200-250,1223,1000-1500
I am so sad to be leaving this review after coming to Mary Coyles for MANY years since I was a child For YEARS Mary Coyles has been my FAVORITE ice cream spot not just in Phoenix but in the COUNTRY yet all of that changed today I go back to when they were on 1335 W Thomas Rd Mom  I came through FAITHFULLY Then they moved to 5521 North 7th Avenue I followed em there along w mom Then they closed shop Then they came back this time at 5823 N 7th St Once again I came back to support them Birthdays special occasions ice cream cravings You name it id come to Mary Coyles for my ice cream fix  I would recommend COUNTLESS friendsfamily members to do the same whenever they came to town Alex was great Peter was great as was the most recent guy I most recently interacted with at the shop his name escapes me Now they have these snobby little girls running the place  its just terrible Why Not because theyre girls nor because the ice cream is bad but because theres a TOTAL lack of customer service  they have these rudecondescending attitudes neither of which any customer deserves especially when the customer has been supporting Mary Coyles practically since DAY ONE There were no smiles or hellos when I walked in the door which was definitely a change compared to all of my previous visits they lacked focus I had to tell them TWICE that my order was for here  not to go  all of this combined with the continued lack of customer service that ill outline below completely kills the experience that ive come to look forward to for so many years now For YEARS I would order the same thing A Chocolate Super 32oz Milkshake with a scoop of chocolate ice cream on top no whipped creamcherry  I would have them mix in a couple tablespoons of peanut butter which they had READILY AVAILABLE in the back No big deal right Alex did it Peter did it This last guy did it It was DELICIOUS every time  it ALWAYS hit the spot This week has been EXTREMELY stressful  I was ready for a fix ice cream is literally my version of an alcoholic beverage  this treat is definitely one that I get in moderationonce in a while In the end I came in today only to have these little girls take my money  literally stand there ARGUING with me about my order refusing to make my 32oz shake the way I have ALWAYS ordered it insisting that they would use Chocolate Peanut Butter Ice Cream instead while at the same time confirming that they DO have peanut butter in the back But I didnt want my shake made with chocolate peanut butter ICE CREAM I just wanted a Super 32oz Chocolate Shake made with CHOCOLATE Ice Cream  a couple tablespoons of peanut butter mixed in which is how I have always ordered it for YEARS now with NO PROBLEM Why is this such a big deal Moreso why argue with a LIFELONG customer over something so stupid Why not just make the milkshake the way that the customer has ALWAYS ordered it instead of taking hisher money then standing there arguing with them over something as stupid as ICE CREAM all because you claim you dont want to get in trouble Get in trouble over tossing a couple tablespoons of peanut butter into a Chocolate Milkshake SERIOUSLY Just ridiculous By the time the girl who was going to be making my shake finished arguing with me  throwing her weight around all 50lbs of it I just took my receipt up to the other girl got my money back  left while advising her that this would be my last visit I cant tell you how disappointing it is to know that ive come to Mary Coyles since before either of these little girls was even born yet now im subjected to the total lack of customer service that I faced today I guess if youre ok with stuff plain jane without any hellossmilesmixins youll be fine here But thats not what ive come to expect over the YEARS at Mary Coyles  at the end of the day theres far too many ice cream options around town who have NO problems making a milkshake exactly as the customer orders it Never thought it would come to this but at this point im done with Mary Coyles until they get some new people who will just do their job  focus on the CUSTOMER  If these little girls would TRULY get in trouble over something as silly as making a milkshake using ingredients that they already have READILY AVAILABLE in the shop then at that point id say its clearly a problem with OWNERSHIPmanagement  the entire place needs to just shut down again for good this time As stated im done with this place until I see some new faces in there  if they act the same way these little girls acted today im done for GOOD I dont care how good your ice cream is No LIFELONG customer deserves to be treated the way I was treated today especially not by some SNOBBY little girls Just disgusting  such a let down after so many years of good memories ,negative,915,500+,4998,2000+
We had breakfast here every morning while we stayed at the Venetian And now that were are back home I wish it was as readily accessible We ordered coffee every morning as LV hotel rooms dont seem to have coffee makers in them and it was fresh and flavorful But the pastries are what really shined here My favorite was the chocolate almond croissant For once I didnt have to choose between my two favorites It was rich buttery flaky and decadent in the most wonderful way We also had the financier a cinnamon roll and cheese danish All were delicious and memorable Truly happy food  Pricing wasnt bad considering the quality We pay similar prices for similar quality food in Dallas If I ever go back to Vegas again Ill make a visit,positive,135,100-150,759,500-1000

I got the Cereal Milk milkshake for myself and a chocolate pretzel soft for someone no problems with the soft serve but the cereal milk was not very good Tasted like almost spoiled old milk and was not even filled in the cup not worth the price I asked for cereal milk at the register which shouldve been 75 but they charged me for a Chocolate cereal which was 9 and I didnt realize til after they made the wrong drink told them and they got mad at me for THEM taking the wrong order They made the correct drink for me and angrily offered the wrong one for free I hesitated on taking it because they were angry when offering and then they angrily lashed back oh you dont want the free one before I got a chance to answer but I grabbed the drink and walked away As I walked away they gave me attitude and continued looking at me and my family and were talking about me and my family It was so rude and the wrong drink was straight up chocolate syrup,negative,186,150-200,968,500-1000
Amazing ppl and product Real ingredients and the best part only real ingredients as listed on the side of the pint,positive,21,<50,118,<500
update also interesting to note that nobody has reached out to me from this company to apologize i was so hopeful when i walked in and saw the cute atmosphere and the flavors looked delicious the girl who took our order though was visibly disgusted by my ordering and paying for my two ice creams and a drip coffee that cost exactly 2009 for some reason even though the ice cream was just like a regular scoop idk cool atmosphere but very bizarre vibes from the employees,negative,87,75-100,478,<500
Overhyped I thought that Pages tasted like an average softserve ice cream shop I was also surprised about the lack of flavors that they offered there was no cookies and cream or sorbets I ordered a small Chocolate Chip ice cream with rainbow sprinkles and my boyfriend ordered the Strawberry Shortcake sundae My Chocolate Chip ice cream tasted identical to Breyers boxed ice cream from the grocery store I may have ordered the wrong item but because it is softserve ice cream they dont offer samples My boyfriend had the Strawberry Shortcake sundae which had 3 pieces of cake on the bottom 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream strawberry syrup strawberries not fresh almonds and whipped cream It was huge and they didnt allow him to swap flavors or make any adjustments Maybe my expectations of Pages were too high but when I had heard about this ice cream shop whose line wrapped down the street I knew I had to check this place out When I went on a Friday night there was no line and the ice cream was subpar,negative,182,150-200,1030,1000-1500
Ordered the red velvet cupcake as well as a chocolate Carmel Macchiato cupcake and they were cold and dry I have tasted much better cupcakes at a grocery store Oh Mr Keller how disappointing,negative,34,25-50,195,<500
This was my first time being here with my best friend and clearly didnt know what was going on or what to do but she got me a a tray and tongs and kind of followed along with everyone else and putting the pastry we wanted on the tray then falling in line Well I saw in line that some people didnt have their tongs and some did so I put mines back As soon as I got to the cashier her name was MICHELLE btw she gave me the biggest attitude with the rudest tone and told me you need to go get the tongs I cant touch this with my hands like OK SORRY THIS IS MY FIRST TIME And while I went back to get the tongs my friend told me that she was talking shit about me to the coworker next to her I didnt know this until after we left Then when I came back with the tongs she said Next time you need to have these with you again in the rudest tone After we left I thought I was just being dramatic but my friend also noticed her big attitude After we left we were going to eat at Pepper Lunch but went back to the bakery because we both felt like we needed to say something We came back and asked to see the manager but ended up speaking with the assistant manager who btw already knew the situation since MICHELLE saw us come back and spoke with her before we did The assistant manager did NOTHING just stood there nodded her head and mostly just said yeah sorry about that like what the heck I dont need a weak apology I need you to recognize that your employee ruined my entire experience and has a completely rude attitude that needs to be checked Even my friend thought talking to the assistant manager was useless cause she looked like she wouldnt do anything based on the response we got So now Im here writing this review because Ive never experienced such TERRIBLE customer service before that ruined my experience and probably never going to come back again Look I get the hype of this place but theres no excuse for employees to be treating customers this way EVER Youre having a bad day Take a break and let it out in the back Dont take it out on your customers I just hope something gets done with this customer service here and MICHELLE,negative,421,300- 500,2194,2000+
Now I know where to come to get gelato if we havent churned any ice cream at home The girl at the counter was very sweet with C and patent with him Had I let him he would have wanted to try all the flavors Lol Their flavors are outstanding Favorites bring cinnamon toast crunch captain crunch and whiskey Irish cream Now if only we can replicate those flavors at home ice cream life would be amazing Lol,positive,78,75-100,415,<500
Even though Donut Bar is brand new to the Las Vegas area Ive been twice already Haha They are killing it Ive heard people say it is the old location of Oface donuts Not positive about this because I never went to Oface Anyways the original location of Donut Bar is from San Diego really glad they brought it to downtown Las Vegas I have to say I was pretty impressed they had Stumptown coffee I am a bit of a coffee snob and Stumptown coffee has got to be my favorite They serve Stumptown at the famous Voodoo Doughnuts in SeattlePortland area to give you a better idea of how serious this coffee is The outdoor patio seating behind Donut bar is also on point Very spacious and surrounded by artwork However the customer service was a bit lacking to me I felt pretty rushed to order by the girl behind the counter She almost seemed annoyed that we didnt automatically know what we wanted to order Pros vegan options outdoor patio seating Stumptown coffee cool bathroom decor amazing coffee selection nitro cold brew coffee on tap location Cons Small space wouldnt like dining inside really loud music for early morning close at 1 pm or until all sold out have to pay for parking only a 1 but still customer service Vegan donuts you must try Banana Caramel Strawberry split Creme Brule Tip for every dozen donuts you buy you get 1 free All in all pretty cool addition to the downtown Las Vegas area Definitely recommend people to go check out this mouth watering new donut shop,positive,270,250-300,1528,1500-2000
While I applaud their marketing strategy Large Sold Out sign in the window makes one wonder what theyve missed out on and make an effort to come back and see to say Ive had better donuts is an understatement Getting there early one is greeted by rows of elegant looking donuts with creative names and flavors and a helpful staff Donuts arent cheap but not as expensive as some have complained about 500 for 2  what do you expect for the Best Donuts In the World I opted for a creme brulee donut for the BF and a huge Mud Pie one for me My friend got a Boston Creme for herself As soon as she took a bite of the Boston Creme I knew this was not the Best Donut In The World entirely too doughy not enough creme Creme didnt go all the way through the bar My Mud Pie tasted like a donut with chocolate sprinkles Fancy name for a less than average donut Again the thing was HUGE which meant a lot of dough for not nearly enough topping I ate about half and got bored BORED With a donut The BFs review was the worst He took one bite and said it was the worst donut hed ever had and that the cooking oil needed to be changed he works in the food industry and I dont so he is more aware of such things He refused to eat any more however helpfully offered me a bite  which I declined He puts the creme brulee as worse than Dunkin Donuts which is about as low as it goes in his book Maybe I dont have the refined donut palette of some of the other clientele maybe Im just looking for something different in my breakfast pastries But I will skip this one next time,negative,311,300- 500,1609,1500-2000
I have heard raving reviews about Batch On my boss wedding his family literally catered the entire Batch Bakehouse collection for the guests ranging from muffins to brownies to pound cakes to cookies and everything else you can imagine So needless to say I had the opportunity to try out the shop in a week with all the leftovers he brought in for work Super cool And then after that I cant stop and found myself going back on a regular basis to get their pastries and cakes I like their system of calling in to ask if they have your favorite item on your craving list And they will happily reserve items for you until you stop in to get them later in the day Because I love their lemon pound cakes to much I will call in before stopping by especially since I live in the west and stopping by would mean making a pretty long drive way out east But I have no qualms about it As I find myself handsomely rewarded with my cravings Batch staff are really polite and didnt pester us when we take forever to make up our minds what we wanted Because to be honest I would want everything if I could Which is why it always took me so long to decide whether I want to go for something new or to stick with my usual favs They also bake fresh from scratch daily so everything is fresh out of the oven yum yum,positive,253,250-300,1320,1000-1500
I was super excited to try this place but I was so disappointed Maybe its just not my cup of tea I ordered a cereal milk soft serve with the cornflake crunch and a slice of crack pie When I tasted the soft serve I couldnt really pinpoint the flavor It tasted like milk with a hint of salt I definitely did not imagine it to taste like that I thought it would have tasted like milk with a mixture of the sweetness from frosted flakes The topping continued to add onto the disappointment because I was expecting it to be crunchy and sweet It was crunchy but it was definitely not sweet more like crunchy and salty The flavor of the cornflake crunch did not go well with the cereal milk soft serve The crack pie tasted a lot better than the soft serve but it wasnt amazing I dont understand the hype about this place,negative,157,150-200,836,500-1000
I waited in line for 45 minutes to get mediocre pastries which was very disappointing As I observed the line I was really stunned by how inefficient they are I think they like the line to be long to build hype but most people are just there because of the show Dont bother,negative,53,50-75,280,<500
Always worth the wait The cannolis are just phenomenal but never have had a bad thing there,positive,17,<50,93,<500

The ice cream was good Not as good as Mary Coyles was The staff ruined the whole experience How do you screw up a single scoop ice cream order The place is tiny and the other patrons were a bunch of Scottsdale wannabe uppity jerks Way overpriced Will not be going back,negative,52,50-75,277,<500
Decided to do an update since I have recently stopped in to Amelies Nothing much has changed  Even higher prices and quality has gone down I ordered a Pistacio Petit Gateau sounds wonderful right It was horrible Very little cake and a thick oily frosting the cake tasted very refrigerated like more than a day and it was on the stale side At nearly 6 dollars you should be ashamed What a charming place but goods are mostly not worth the money,negative,83,75-100,459,<500

Ive watched Cake Boss for YEARS Been a fan for a long time so naturally anytime Im in Vegas or any city that has a Carlos Bakery I stop in for some goodies I usually get a few lobster tails because they are to die for But this last trip I got 2 lobster tails and a slice of the rainbow cake SO disappointed the lobster tail had shrunk in size dramatically and it was still frozen in the middle and tasted freezer burnt as well The cake was so flavorless and dull the texture isnt even that good All in all Im just disappointed,negative,105,100-150,544,500-1000
By far the best cupcakes Ive ever had I always have to get a box of these while in Vegas Strawberry and vanilla are my two faves For sure a musttry place if you enjoy your sweets,positive,37,25-50,184,<500

The French Toast ice cream was EXTREMELY salty to the point where a few bites in could give you hypertension We also tried the Birthday Cake Milkshake that was also bad It seemed like the milk or cream had gone bad On top of that its odd that an ice cream place in a casino wouldnt offer tap or iced water,negative,61,50-75,311,<500
Went here tonight to get some ice cream We were excited to try a new place Its located in a cute bungalow on 5th St by Roosevelt We walked in and looked at the case a variety of homemade ice creams all half MELTED We asked the guy behind the counter what the story was His response uhhhhhh yeah its kinda hot Really Apparently this place is called melt for a reason And at 450 for a small you can keep your half melted ice cream We went to Safeway and bought a carton of frozen Ben and Jerrys for 4,negative,101,100-150,521,500-1000
Great little bakerycoffee shop in upper Lawrenceville The desserts are beyond beautiful and taste amazing The service and the wifi are a bit slow but otherwise well worth a visit,positive,30,25-50,182,<500
Great cheesecake and sweets coffee isnt a priority Need I say more Been here twice and both times they had unique cheesecake and other cake options When youre craving for cheesecake outside of the Cheesecake Factory this is a place to come to I really cant speak on behalf of their other sweets but they do look great The building outside as well as interior is a bit dated but that doesnt stop locals from enjoying the plethora of goodies and desserts they have to offer,positive,86,75-100,481,<500
Ive waited so long for Milk Bar to open in Las Vegas in order for me to try the desserts Ive made cookies pies and cakes from the cookbook without ever tasting the originals so I have been so excited to see how comparable they were and what I could possibly change in order to make the baked goods just like the ones they make at Milk Bar I ordered a slice of the highly addictive crack pie and three types of cookies cornflake marshmallow compost and corn All were underwhelming The crack pie tasted more fattening than sweet much like eating a sweet stick of butter compared to the caramel toffee tones to balance the salty oatmeal crust I had expected from it The corn cookie also lacked the corn flavor Out of all the desserts I enjoyed the compost cookie the best The coffee and chocolate hints are great otherwise the cookie just tasted like a powerprotein bar Given the disappointment and the quality for the price I wont be going back Ill just stick to the cookbook versions,negative,181,150-200,1009,1000-1500
The ice cream was good The two stars are for the cranky employee who served us First he wouldnt give me a sample of their Ice cream flavors I wanted to try the Carmel Apple He said it was due to the the long line line was only 5 people deep after us with 3 windows open but then he said Just one sample When he returned with the one sample I was there with 2 other people that were too scared to even ask for a sample because the employee was so snappy Secondly when we ordered one of my people said she wanted the salted Carmel Ice Cream in a cone The employee said the ice cream is somewhat melted and suggested a cup We asked for a sugar cone on top of the cup so she could crunch the sugar cone into the ice cream We did that also with the Carmel Apple and the cookie dough ice creams Finally to my surprise the employee charged me for the sugar cones 25 each not nice to charge you on the back end of 2 buck Tuesday where the single scoop is two bucks deal There goes your tip Mr Cranky employee Also remember Mr Cranky you were the one that said the ice cream was melty and suggested a cup So I guess two buck Tues is not really two bucks if people are charged for the sugar cone On the other hand their ice cream was good creamy and actually had good apple flavor and ribbons of carmel If you do go just be warned the sugar cones are 25 more if you get your ice cream in a cup,negative,284,250-300,1432,1000-1500

Very basic pastries We were very excited to try The Cake Boss bakery but it was disappointing As I wrote in the review about his restaurant due to his popularity they very busy and cater to quantity rather than quality Ive been to better bakeries dont waste your time in the long lines or your money My SO tried a cupcake and had the cannoli cheesecake they are gluten free so no crust my favorite part I will not return Overrated,negative,81,75-100,445,<500
Came here this past weekend and unfortunately they had really bad service First of all they were all out of a lot of items The menu was not updated The workers were very rude and unfriendly I have been to the Disneyland location in the locations in Hollywood and San Francisco and they are not like this The worker was rude I asked to change my flavor and he had a smart remark saying that he only had two hands This is unacceptable behavior as a worker I will not return here at all,negative,94,75-100,491,<500

We paid our second visi to this location of Sprinkles yesterday and I guess Im a fan Service was young sweet and eager to please while it was surprisingly slow yesterday We stopped in at around 830 after a ride on the high roller and picked up a chai cupcake lemon coconut vegan red velet and vanilla minis The minis are so cute and perfect for kids if you dont want them bouncing off the walls from the sugar My favorite was the lemon coconut of our selection although the chai was also quite tasty with its strong chai spices Vegan red velvet is made with coconut oil and my friend who is vegan said it was very moist and delicious Id say the Sprinkles here are up to par with the locations Ive visited in California with the exception of one thing I have yet to see the SALTED CARAMEL cupcake at this location Salted caramel is hands down the best Sprinkles cupcake flavor ever so please carry it soon Thanks,positive,172,150-200,937,500-1000
I love the goodies at this place and Im so glad they have a store in Las Vegas Their cake pops are delicious Youre supposed to keep them refrigerated but they can stay out for 5 hours I have bought them in the morning and flown out and kept them unrefrigerated for about 7 hours and thrown them in the fridge and they were still fine I love the chocolate flavor and the other seasonal ones are good too I also LOVE the cookies The compost cookie is amazing and the blueberries and cream is delicious The double chocolate one too They dont always have every flavor but they usually at least have the compost corn flakes and blueberries This is located in the Cosmo where all the food is so its also easy to find,positive,136,100-150,733,500-1000

Prestis is great I mostly go here for cheap lunch and cant really vouch for their baked goods and desserts except to say that their cannoli are tasty cannoli is plural Its really convenient to come her for lunch if you work at CWRU or UH For me its a ten minute walk so I only come here when I have some extra time to kill Ever since I started getting lunch here it has been hard for me to justify paying more for a slice of cardboard pizza in the cafeteria than it costs for a slice of Prestis pizza By the way I recommend the artichoke pizza Its amazing The have a take a number system and they are often busy around lunch time Even when the place is packed it only takes about ten minutes for your number to be called,positive,144,100-150,743,500-1000
This place is a small ice cream place with a lot of potential but from what I saw doesnt know they have that potential I went there twice on my visit to Arizona first time got chocolate and fruity pebbles Chocolate was great creamy and smooth with good flavor Fruity pebbles tasted like it but too sweet and when u got a bite of pebbles it was soggy like they churned the ice cream with the pebbles in it instead of just folding them into the ice cream This is just a preference for me My first time there was 1 guy working register and counter and never smiled or really said a word If you would ask for a sample it was like you just asked him for a million dollars and his house Just not a friendly fellow the second time we went there it was properly 45 minutes before closing so 1015 which is still early in this town and they were open but had zero ice cream Now the guy at the counter was sorry and seemed it But still litterly the only thing they sell is ice cream and you run out Why and how I appreciate they make it from scratch I used to too But why only make enough for the day Why not big batchs fresh ice cream has a shelf life of at least 45 days So ice cream is good but if you run out of ice cream before you close you either need to close earlier or make more ice cream Thats why I had to give 2 stars,negative,270,250-300,1341,1000-1500

This came up on my Yelp suggestions as a hot new place that sells matcha tea drinks and food It is located in The Arboretum near Penzeys Spices Parking can be a bit crazy but there usually are some spots Definitely recommend driving carefully as some people tend to drive faster than they should in this plaza They are known for their softserve and parfaits with matcha I ordered their matcha latte iced The gals working there were pleasant and the order came out quickly Drink tasted good  no chalky taste and a good balance of sweet and the natural flavors of matcha Most were ordering softserve and it looked great  Ill try it the next time I come The interior is cute  aesthetic lighting and natural wood tables Id love to sit and enjoy my purchase in the cafe next time I visit,positive,147,100-150,801,500-1000

An array of freshly baked cookies bread pastry  othes that will surely excite you You go through the selection using an empty tray and by the end of it you will be surprised to see how much you got Price is reasonable they s add lso have a great selection of cakes by the slice or whole and drinks too There is a seating area Paying for your pastries could be more organized Having several lines instead of one line may be better My fave are their cookies egg tarts and muffins,positive,93,75-100,488,<500
This was a delicious treat that I cant wait to try again The best deal is the Ice Cream Flight or Trio  tasting three flavors along with a waffle cone wedge all for 600 Its more than enough ice cream and lets you taste any three flavors Even if you dont get the trio you can sample any flavor before purchase My favs  Brambleberry Crisp and Gooey Butter Cake Next tastes will include the dark chocolate option,positive,79,75-100,425,<500

Favorites Raspberry macaron chocolate croissant kouign amann 5 stars because Im a very loyal consumer and a huge fan of the bakery There are 2 locations in the hotel I go to the one insideadjacent to the casino Very good warm croissant breakfast sandwich house coffee Banana cream puff Not so favorite experience Eclair it was stale caramel macaron my preference is for it to have less caramel filling Noticed they dont seem to replace all their baked goods with fresh ones daily Service Very nice  friendly counter person who generously gave me the last 2 broken raspberry macarons for free I purchased 6 as a gift already  me and my 3 year old had a very nice treat  Not so nice  brusque and aggressive counter person who scoffed at a sweet teen girls unique name not traditionally American in front of me The counter person continued to spread her negativity to other customers she definitely should not have worked that morning,positive,166,150-200,969,500-1000

Prestis is a solid spot for a snack and a coffee  they have plenty of seating both inside and outside and run efficiently with deli ticket style ordering I love coming here and camping out in one of the window seats to do study and people watch while people are chattering around me They have an astounding selection really everything you could think of an Italian bakery might have However a lot of the food is made earlier in the day so in the late afternoon after pastries have been sitting out for a while it might be better to look elsewhere You can never go wrong with the gelato or any of the cakes  this is definitely the spot to order a custom cake for a special occasion my favs being the tiramisu ofc and the pistachio Whats also fun is that they are maybe the only place in Little Italy that sells pizza slices and they have a great hotsavory food selection as well,positive,168,150-200,896,500-1000

How is it possible that I have never reviewed Pages how any proper Pittsburgher refers to this spot Its a Pittsburgh institution and most definitely the first place I think to take an outofowner when it comes to Pittsburgh ice cream spots The soft serve is delicious but what really makes this place is the collaborations with fellow Pittsburgh small businesses like Nancy Bs chocolate chip cookies local cinnamon buns blondies try the Yinzer sundae and banana bread Look for the Made in Pittsburgh marker on the little banner ads they have hanging on the windows while you wait in line and those would be the goto items in my opinion I can honestly say Ive never had a bad item here The Nancy Bs best chocolate chip cookie in the city and Yinzer are two favorites but one day they were out of both toward the end of the season and I got the cinnamon bun sundae which was surprisingly light with crunchy pastry pieces The seasonal softserve flavors are also a big favorite try the blueberry a very fast melter so get eating quick during summer and pumpkin and apple during fall They were briefly accepting cards via online orderingcurbside pickup earlier during Covid but are back to cash only so bring your cash unless you want to pay an onsite ATM fee and be prepared for some long lines and challenging parking during peak summer evening or weekend hours Its worth it,positive,245,200-250,1411,1000-1500
Major fail If this place is supposed to be a great representation of Pittsburghs offerings Pittsburgh is in trouble  It was a hot night So of course we wanted ice cream Dude the soft serve was just a melted mess It was more like a gross milkshake cuz it was so liquidy But it also tasted like hell I ordered a coffee arctic w heath bar candy How dare she claim that its like a blizzard This thing was nowhere near a blizzard I could mix ingredients better at home And w better flavor Then the kid ordered the mango soft serve The server said we dont have mango We had to point it out to her on the menu They dont offer samples She said its probably good Um no it was not good at all It was so disgusting that my kid couldnt even eat it And we NEVER throw away ice cream Tip to the business if your soft serve is a hot melted mess dont open your doors until you fix your refrigeration problem,negative,179,150-200,945,500-1000
Absolutely awful experience It was hair in my ice cream and the manager was super rude about it and said they dont give refunds,negative,24,<50,131,<500
Jarlings Custard Cup is a Champaign favorite I remember hearing that Tom Hanks once stopped by when I was a kid You cant go wrong here everything is delicious My two favorites are the banana split fancy and a single scoop of lemon on a sugar cone simple The Turtle Sunday is also fantastic  In short when in Champaign its always a good idea to stop by for a sweet treat,positive,72,50-75,386,<500
I have never heard of Jenis ice cream My niece however from Ohio has frequent hit them in her hometown So of course she found this place in Charlotte while we were visiting together and we had to go here after dinner They were crowded A very long line outside and inside But no complaints It gave us time to chitchat and the lines seem to move along pretty smoothly Ill try the Wildberry lavender ice cream it was to die for I loved loved this flavor I definitely tasted hints of lavender weaved within the wild berry flavors I believe it was a mix between a sorbet and yogurt Everything about this ice cream has me reminiscing about it Very nice cool ice cream joint with an assortment of mouth watering flavors like Mexican Hot Chocolate and Skillet Cinnamon Roll Yum Ill have to see if they ship nationwide because that lavender flavor is calling my name,positive,158,150-200,886,500-1000
Went here yesterday morning because of all the raves They supposedly had the best doughnuts in the world We had the coconut blueberry cheesecake creme brulee and birthday cake oreo doughnuts First of all they were all very dry My daughter hated the birthday cake oreo doughnut she said it was overly sweet even when I took out the oreo it was still very sweet We also ordered their strawberry milk and chocolate milk They tasted like regular milk Going there was a mistake About 2 hours later my daughter started getting sick my daughter is still suffering until now Ill take Krispy Kreme over this place anytime,negative,108,100-150,628,500-1000
There is nothing for satisfying than the experience of eating ice cream on a hot spring day Certainly I was not disappointed by this place I tried chocolate and mint chocolate ice cream on a waffle cone Seriously delicious A couple things to add  line was quite long so dress yourself with patience  there is a limited amount of flavors but the traditional ones are there  my cone broke half the way through and as a consequence I made a huge mess highly recommend getting tons of napkins or getting a cup  ,positive,97,75-100,519,500-1000
Went here for a rainbow cookie This place claims to be an italian bakery and rainbow cookies are a staple in italian bakeries This was quite literally the WORST rainbow cookie i have ever had Im not being dramatic It tasted NOTHING like a traditional rainbow cookie It tasted like a bland flavorless cake with a hard chocolate coating It was awful i took one bite and threw it away It certainly was not a rainbow cookie in any sense of the word do not go here if a rainbow cookie is what you are looking for I cant speak for their other desserts,negative,104,100-150,557,500-1000
I tried Bouchon once in New York and it blowed my mind The best hot chocolate Ive ever tasted along with some pastries This time I was so excited to try my best drink here at Las Vegas and very disappointed It was just a watery chocolate drink I can get way better satisfied one from Starbuck with cheaper price So disappointedwhy is it different quality under same name and same price,negative,72,50-75,395,<500
This place is a must Its on a side street but def the visit the donuts are fresh  I am embarrassed to say I ate the damn apple fritter three days latter  it was SLAMMING absolutely delicious Purchased a box of goodies for 10 oh yeah anything toy can fit in the box for 10 amazingly yummy,positive,59,50-75,300,<500
Weve seen people standing in line for several months at this place We always wanted to go see what the fuss was all aboutand after ordering the much anticipated a common Brownie Sundae and Blondie Sundae we quickly realized there was no difference between Handles and DQ If youre willing to spend 13 on a couple of average sundaes We recommend you run into Smiths and grab yourself some HaagenDaza real ice cream and make your own It just wasnt that good,negative,82,75-100,470,<500
We were very excited to try The Cake Boss bakery but it was disappointing The kids had ordered a cake online and was delivered to our home a while back and I thought for the price point it was just ok my opinion The kids love the flavor of the rainbow cake option over taste The bakery is very popular with great reviews so Im going to assume that the bakery puts out fresh cakes and not refrigerated ones Due to his popularity they a very busy bakery but please focus on your shipments of cakes and vending machines supplies because I have now tried both and have been very disappointed for the amount of money spent quantity over quality,negative,120,100-150,648,500-1000
Very cool little place to stop if youre walking the strip to grab a coffee pasty or some macarons Located right off the sidewalk in the Venetian it is pretty convenient I thought the macarons were pretty great and the place overall actually feels like a regular bakery instead of a place on the vegas strip which to me is a big plus,positive,63,50-75,339,<500
The sign for a box of 6 assorted flavored macarons said 15 But I got charged 1750 Its bad business to put up a sign for one price and overcharge it when my card is rung up Thats fraudulent sales practices I wont be going back to get ripped off againand no the sales tax is not 1667 in Vegas,negative,60,50-75,307,<500

This place is super darling Thats right super Ive only been once and it was to quickly grab some cookies to curb a serious pastry craving I had never heard of Churn and found them via good old Yelp I snagged a Chocolate Chocolate Chip cookie and another fabulous cookie that sadly enough I cant remember exactly It had cranberries and it was heavenly I love how they have old school candy displayed through out the store Good to know for when Im buying goodies for events or holidays Their ice cream selection is killer and I will be making a special trip out there one of these smoking hot days to enjoy some,positive,114,100-150,623,500-1000
I will keep this short and to the point The 2 stars is for their seemingly complete disregard for customer safety No masks no gloves and zero physical distance between employees inside the space And while I cannot comment on their cleaning practices when they open and close it was clear to me when we picked up a pint they they need to improve their interaction practices with the customers I wore a mask it would be simple for the owner to provide them for his employees I implore the owner to reach out to me and let me know that they are working to improve On the plus side the ice cream was spectacular Now if they can only improve the safety,negative,123,100-150,659,500-1000
I have never rated anyone or any place before I am very sorry to say that tonight was the worst ice cream I have every had I live only blocks away and have come to this ice cream store several times since their opening and have had such a great following after great reviews by many of the food magazines Tonight I ordered a double scoop waffle cone Bottom was to be peanut butter cup and top was roasted almond When I went to check out the girl at the cash register thought I had a single scoop ice cream cone I felt that it looked like I did too But I was honest and charged for a double The top ice cream almost melted so fast I barely made it to the car in the parking lot in front of the store and had to lick it all off before it melt down my hands The peanut butter scoop was like someone had forgotten the cream It was so ice ladden it was nonidentifiable Sorry to say they have not kept up their prior quality PS Also as I was checking out a young man came up to identify a bug in his lemon ice cream The young people behind the counter looked at him like a liar and then a more advanced personnel quickly took the sundae and said she would take care of it What happens to businesses that get such great acknowledgement and then when they become popular dont think they have to keep up caring You DO,negative,262,250-300,1342,1000-1500
All I can say about this place is you must try a chocolate covered strawberry They are huge and juicy and delicious The baked goods look amazing and taste like a little slice of heaven They have bakers next door baking to fill up the yummy treats for the store You cant go wrong with the deliciousness from here,positive,59,50-75,320,<500
Was very disappointed We got 3 cupcakes and a carrot cake and 2 cupcakes were rock solid and the frosting was bland Vanilla cupcake was very dry and lacked flavor Carrot cake was also dry We expected more based on the name but I could make a better cupcake from boxed mix,negative,52,50-75,276,<500
What a fun throw back to a simpler time when you would go with a date or your family for some ice cream at a sitdown establishment There are tons of options all of which are wonderful from what I can tell I just love that place like this even exists,positive,51,50-75,254,<500
Terrible service not only messed the order up but then said we ordered it wrong They came out and said they would do me a favor and give me what I originally ordered Was very disappointed because we had heard good things Everyone makes mistakes but to compound it and act like it was our fault And patronize me and say but we wont charge you extra for what I had originally ordered 2300 for a couple of breakfast sandwiches and drinks but the attitude was free Thanks but no thanks The rude server was MJ,negative,96,75-100,523,500-1000
I make it a point to visit this place before leaving Vegas This would be my last visit to this place Off the bat the worker girl with the braided hair was so rude I get it  you hate your job  but really If I ask a question about a canoli I dont need it with a rude undertone and eye roll Believe what everyone says about the pastries  theyre waxy and taste a day old The only thing I can recommend is the 7 layer cookies they were very good Ordered 2 lobster tails 2 eclairs 2 canoli 4 pecan powdered balls 2 layer cookies a box of sugar cookies a carrot cupcake and and 3 cream puffs  60 worth there were 3 of us ordering The promotion was spend 30  get a free water bottle 50  get a free apron When my order was ready I asked if I can get the water bottle and the cashier said that wasnt allowed I asked if he can do split orders and said that also wasnt allowed I wont be coming back The service has gone downhill The pastries arent that great and theyre very pricey,negative,202,200-250,1015,1000-1500

I tried Crack Pie Cereal Milk ice cream cheese and eggs bread Food tastes bland monotonous in flavor overly sweet and definitely overpriced I would not eat here again Desserts do not need to be overly complex but when they are like at Milk then theyd better be amazing They are below average I do not understand the hype Any dessert at the Wicked Spoon buffet would hands down beat what Milk sells They were nice to give us a cup of cold water which was refreshing and good,negative,89,75-100,487,<500
I heard about Novel from Instagram when they first opened and we JUST got the chance to go I had a Leslie Knope with Fat Elvis ice cream with reeses puffs my husband had a dough melt with the cherry sundae ice cream and the raspberry drizzle and my son had a halfhalf scoop with cookie monster and cherry sundae Everything was so incredibly delicious top quality and made with love The owners Brandon and Jennifer were so sweet We will go back and send all of our friends Love the location too Super quirky and its great to see so many local phx businesses come together and support one another Proud to be a phx girl in a nutshell RUN DONT DONT WALK to Novel Ice Cream,positive,128,100-150,687,500-1000

It was a little hard to find the place but any dessert lover should definitely check out this place We ordered the raspberry macaron an apple croissant and a plain croissant The plain croissant wasnt very flaky and didnt taste very good The apple croissant on the other hand was delicious Crunchy butter sugar topping on a sweet layer of thinly sliced apples and a yummy croissant It was delicious The macarons were huge They were about two or three inches in diameter which is huge for a normal macaron The ratio of filling to shell was perfect not too much not too little I thought the raspberry macaron had a very pleasant flavor It wasnt extremely strong but it was definitely present Overall it was a pretty good snack but I would skip the plain croissant,positive,137,100-150,785,500-1000

The Bouchon Bakery is a convenient place to enjoy the spoils of Thomas Kellers food genius if you forgot to make reservations at the Bouchon CafÃ Its a small togo shop and they sell coffee pastries and sandwiches They also sell macaroons in a decorative box 1699  a perfect gift for the pet sitter or for that coworker covering for you while youre in Vegas There was virtually no line when we went there twice and the service was attentive,positive,81,75-100,460,<500

Laughable I got a single sundae with hot fudge hot caramel and pecans After I started eating the sundae I discovered there was no hot fudge not to mention no much in the way of caramel or nuts When I took my sundae back up to the counter they proceeded to put the hot fudge on top of the whipped cream To make matters worse the hot fudge was not hot so it was two big globs of thick fudge on the sundae If I was making the sundae I would have thrown that first monstrosity away and said to the customer Lets get this sundae rightespecially considering my sundae was over 6 I also found it odd that all of the specialty sundaes only came with the option of 5 or 7 scoops It seems the menu caters to groups who are sharing one dessert This was definitely a disappointing first and most likely last visit to a supposed Phoenix institution,negative,162,150-200,862,500-1000
I decided to stop in since it was over 100 and cool off with a mint chocolate chip waffle cone There wasnt really a welcome when I walked in very limited seating The staff did recommend I try the ice cream before I bought so I did They Were Very nice The Cone Was Really Good You Could Tell they Made It In House I loved the fact the ice cream was made in Arizona and it was AMAZING NATURAL ingredient I will be coming back,positive,86,75-100,433,<500

Jenis is ALWAYS on point Midwest grown and slowly making its way from coast to coast I first heard about Jenis several years ago when I met a girl from Ohio when I lived in San Francisco We became friends and both being from the Midwest we shared some of the things we loved and missed one of those things for her was Jenis ice cream So you can only imagine how excited I was when I was living in St Louis a few short years later and they opened a location It was as good as my friend hyped it up to be Sadly well not now but at the time I moved to Charlotte and there was no Jenis SIGH Fast forward a year and a half later and BOOM Jenis has arrived I couldnt wait to get in line and once again see if it lived up to the hype which it did The flavors are so unique and delicious Since its summer they ended up having a few seasonal flavors one of those being frose It was a delicious sorbet type treat and the one I ended up going with That is after I tried half the flavors Again this isnt your normal ice cream shop and you should enter with an open mind and empty stomach Theyll let you try as many flavors as you want dont be greedy though if you find what youre looking for or if your stomach is telling you yes GO FOR IT They do half scoops which are comparable to a smallkiddie scoop at a regular ice cream shop 4 for a scoop or three for 6 no brainer go for THREE And dont forget fresh homemade waffle cones or waffle pieces come with every scoop If youre looking for that cool delicious treat for your summer evening hop on over to Jenis Or anytime for that matter,positive,319,300- 500,1640,1500-2000

I think this place is so new that they still need time to work out their menu and service Staffs were friendly but service was really slow and there were barely any customers when I went Had coffee latte which was very very light barely any coffee tastehmm not that good my cousin tried the mojito and she liked it We also ordered the honey toast with strawberry and cream cheese the presentation was very pretty but I wish they would toast it a bit longer to give it a little extra crunch Overall a good spot to chill if they can improve their drinks and food,negative,107,100-150,568,500-1000
My daughter ordered the mint chocolate chip in a cup I ordered vanilla Mine had a sour taste to it Like spoiled milk I had her try and she said it was awful We threw both of our desserts away Not sure if the sour taste is their thing or it truly was spoiled Either way we wont be back,negative,60,50-75,295,<500
We stop here at least once every trip We love this place Get there early for the best selection The donuts are delicious so is the milk and they have nitro cold brew The decorations are adorable and the staff was super friendly,positive,43,25-50,233,<500
The wait time wasnt very long but I would think that with such a popular bakery that there would be a better system of ordering you have to wait in a line that cuts in front of the door then you only see the pastries that are in front of you not past you because there are people in line By the time its your turn you need to know exactly what you want because the girls helping act like they dont have time to wait for you to decide Out of the 3 girls working I was hoping to get the one that seemed to like being there we did whew Cannolis were okay lobster tails a little hard crumb bun skip it very dry you will need milk or coffee Ill still watch the shows but wont be visiting the bakery again Go to Bouchon Bakery around the corner baked goods are amazing staff super friendly and prices are reasonable,negative,162,150-200,838,500-1000
When Fatty Daddys opened up this place was really great The main attractions were the Fatty Daddy or Mini Daddy cookie cups but the ambiance and staff were amazing too We went in the other night after not visiting in awhile and things felt off Cookie cup Is that the same thing we used to get I thought there were two sizes My friend orders a cookie cup but they only give him half a cookie and a smaller portion of ice cream than normal The girl behind the counter was friendly but seemed a little nervous We asked where the amazing Steve Urkel picture went and the girl explained the business is under new ownership This explains everything Even the POS system is different and doesnt offer rewards or incentives I even got a flier for Fatty Daddys this week advertising Coffee pastries and ice cream Relax refresh recharge Its an ice cream spot not a day spa Say Ice cream coffee pastries at least your name has the word Fatty in it priorities people Anyway This spot is worth looking for and worth the trip The ice cream flavors are a solid mix of classics and unique blends If youve never been here before you wont know the difference and itll probably be a 5 star place for you But I feel new management may have cut out some of the charm and is trying to skimp on things that made us come back for more,negative,248,200-250,1361,1000-1500
My husband and I were excited to take the pilgrimage to Las Vegas to visit Milk Bar Wed heard multiple outstanding reviews and couldnt wait to try out their unique creations I left disappointed While my husband enjoyed his Fruity Cereal Milk shake I wasnt overly impressed with my Cereal Milk soft serve with flakes as my topping The soft serve itself wasnt overly flavorful which made the overwhelming saltiness of the flakes unpalatable I ate a couple bites and couldnt stomach any more It wasnt sweetsavory it was blandsalty Funny enough a more significant part of what made our experience lackluster was the disinterested staff They werent excited about their product they werent happy to be there and their lack of enthusiasm shone through I wont be returning to Milk Bar in the future,negative,135,100-150,817,500-1000
So overpriced So ridiculous A candy bar over there is 459 and in the stores like Walgreens CVS VONS etc is half price or better Super inconvenient area weird area between OSheas and the Flamingo who knew you could put a whole overpriced retail promenade in between the two They did FACT model it after the retail promenade in Downtown Disney proves that this is nothing but a rip off and forcing you to walk by tons of overpriced retail to get to the main attraction the ferris wheel,negative,89,75-100,508,500-1000
We have recently discovered the Rock Hill location in the former Citizen Corners building Such an amazing place for many reasons Our kids are enthralled with the upstairs loft that allows you to overlook the entire shop The quirky decor and interesting art is a feast for the eyes And the pastry Croissants to die for Dainty little petit fours tarts and eclairs are just incredible And a damn fine cup of coffee We love this place for date night or a family treat,positive,84,75-100,476,<500

Okay  so let me first say that I actually agree with some of the things said in the 2 star reviews  Ive had some servers at the counter who were either a bit rude or made me feel rushed  kinda like if I wasnt ready to decide why was I standing there  cant speak for the cakessweetspastries  I do know good baguette when I have it and they do  they also have a good croissant my favorite is the sandwich au jambon  the croque moinseur is also decent  yes it is trendy especially compared to 115 years ago  it used to not be so crowded  but for the things they have that I like I still think its pretty good I think I might try one of the soups next time in,positive,142,100-150,680,500-1000
I ordered a delivery for Mothers Day that was never delivered Ive been trying to get my money back ever since No one can help when I call and I never receive a call back by someone who can During one call I was told So many people complain and I dont know why The owner never makes his deliveries for some reason No idea how the treats actually taste but the customer service is absolute crap,negative,77,75-100,408,<500
If you are looking for baked goods similar to your local grocery chain look no further Service is excellent and the staff all helpful with recommendations and attentiveness I appreciate the care all the staff give to patrons but unfortunately I didnt stop by for the service rather the food The croissants are not worth the space they occupy in the belly I tried both regular and almond both bland boring and unsatisfying I left disappointed and waited the following day to hit Bouchon for a tasty almond croissant If Bouchon is open Id suggest going there for pastries,negative,99,75-100,583,500-1000

Oh man Disappointed We ordered the white cake with fudge icing and it had no flavor The chocolate icing didnt taste like chocolate at all The outside of the bakery smelled so wonderful but I dont think that wonderful smell was the cake We wouldnt go back here again most likely,negative,51,50-75,287,<500
Okay so two weeks later almost all their cookies are sold out Today they only had Chocolate Chocolate and Corn Cookies While I knew it was wishful thinking to think they made the cookies onsite they are all packaged selling out confirms it I hope they get their supply figured out They are missing out on a lot of business,negative,60,50-75,333,<500
After a disappointing breakfast nearby my mood was heightened at the reminder of this bakery nearby I stood in line looking at all the bakery items on display My eyes lowered a bit when I couldnt see my go to item in the case Perhaps its in the back waiting to be replenished My time came to order as I asked the gentleman did they have anymore sticky buns in the back To which he said they no longer carry them I cried a little bit inside but at this moment I knew Vegas was no longer the city for me,negative,101,100-150,511,500-1000

Busy Saturday Night when we came in about 1030 PM Line was out the door An employee was handing out free samples of the caramel chocolates for the waiting patrons Great Customer Service Shop offers their paper menus on a stand as you walk in the door Great way to review their options before ordering We had a scoop of the Cookie Dough Ice Cream  a Hot Chocolate Both were tasty The Sundae looked really amazing Nice atmosphere located in a The Linq Lots of other great shops throughout the streets that will be sure to light up your curiosities too,positive,102,100-150,565,500-1000
I was hoping to write a positive review after buying a half dozen this morning but I cant We bought the pop tart stuffed donut red velvet lemon blueberry chocolate bacon and chocolate cake I would give the visual 5 stars Taste not so good The glazed donuts were undercooked and doughy The cake were dry The chocolate frosting was really just ok I hope I just went on an off day Not comparable to Pink Box,negative,77,75-100,419,<500
Great ice cream for sure Worth an hour wait Ehhhh probably not The ice cream is tasty and creamy and the cone was fantastic I got turned on to this brand in FL They had some wedding cake ice cream that was a special flavor and it was absolutely amazing But I have to say that while it is good I cant say its worth the line they have outside this location Not their fault but I dinged one star for the line outside,positive,84,75-100,424,<500
I tried their Cannoli and it was horrible no chocolate on the end the cream tasted sour the shell was stale The Chocolate Chip cookie was very hard felt like it was going to break my teeth my friends had Walnut Wedge and Chocolate meringue cookie their treats were just as bad as ours Buddy better hire some good cooks or will fail as of now there is no reason to come back to many staff behind the counter and not taking orders 1 star is being generous,negative,88,75-100,453,<500
Been here the last three times we have been to Vegas Although the desserts we have ordered have been good they have been out of Buddys famous cannolis two of those three times we visited Not sure how that happens,negative,40,25-50,217,<500
When I travel to Phoenix for work I always make it a point to stop by and get some ice cream First the weather here is usually never cold enough to stop me and second they always seem to have some creative flavors like fruity pebbles or coffee  donuts Best part is theyll serve you ice cream in an old school Chinese food takeout box with a fortune cookie on top Cant beat that,positive,75,50-75,387,<500
Seriously still not sure why there is a line of people waiting for this ice cream Not tasty price is high,negative,21,<50,109,<500

I have always loved the NoDa Amelies so I hate to write a bad review I drove across town for food After waiting in line I got to the register around 930 Closing was at 10 The cashier told me no food because weve already closed the kitchen My order didnt require any preparation aside from heating it up and putting it in a box I asked to take it cold figuring Id heat it up at home The cashier refused again Shutting down the kitchen early is lazy and I doubt the owner would be thrilled about the lost profits If youre going to cut corners so that you can leave 10 minutes earlier at least be willing to work with customers,negative,123,100-150,647,500-1000
Why do I always do this to myself Okay Ill admit it I had high hopes for Amelies After viewing their website and reading the rave reviews I expected somethingelse Maybe my hopes were too high but I was ready to die in chocolate heaven float on my blissful boat of yumminess and celebrate another year of being alive Alas it was not to be My 50 chocolate chocolate birthday cake was anything but heavenly and not at all blissful In fact Im pretty sure that Harris Teeter makes a better chocolate cake That being said however I still have hope for Amelies and wont dismiss it until Ive tried some of their other sugary confections,negative,116,100-150,657,500-1000

Great location but slow service Came in at 11 PM on a Saturday for our standard red velvet ice cream on a red velvet cone and ordered the ice cream sandwich too Was delicious as always especially in that hot weather However they only had 2 employees and I clocked in a waiting time of 20 minutes from standing in line with 11 people in front to finally paying and typing in my rewards number At one point the other girl went to the back for a couple of minutes which just left the girl ringing us up all by herself and the other customers just glaring Went back to our usual location in Newport Beach and noticed 45 employees on a Saturday at 8PM Las Vegas location definitely needs to hire more staff especially in such a crowded area,negative,140,100-150,748,500-1000
The place is in a cool little area but the ice cream wasnt that great It was okay but nothing special It was tasteless The salted caramel had way too much salt This just could have been a bad batch Probably wouldnt go back,negative,44,25-50,230,<500

This place is horrible Im a fan of Cake Boss and the Next Great Baker I had dessert reservations at another place but decided to cancel once I found out there was a Carlos here I was excited to try it I get there and of course there is a bit of a wait but that is understandable I will say the people packing up the orders were a tad slow but ok no big deal I ordered cannolis cookies carrot cake and crumb cake 100 disgusting The cannoli filling didnt taste like anything and it was kind of hard The cookies were hard as bricks The carrot cake tasted like a block of cream cheese with a little spice mixed in The crumb cake was hard as a brick as well I wasted my money on this place AVOID AVOID AVOID,negative,142,100-150,724,500-1000
If you would like to experience the 5 stages of grief and wait only about 45 minutes to get an incorrect order of a simple single scoop with 1 topping then go to Mary Coyle Prepubescent kids will serve a happy family of five and a murder of boomers before kindly serving you They will indulge old hags about how business is going and chat it up before noticing you sitting right in front of them If you get lucky however you will enjoy their angelic singing of every song that plays on the classic 955 the mountain radio station Great location and bathroom instructions are simple group of crows,negative,110,100-150,606,500-1000

Drive to Lawrenceville for a piece of cake Yes Please Visited this lovely boutique bakery tonight for dessert and we where over the moon My husband had the rosemary cinnamon almond cake and I had the lavender infused cake Several of the cakes were vegan and looked wonderful Your piece of heaven is served on a China plate The seating is either in its unique cafÃ or outside on its a wonderful patio The prices are definitely worth it and did I say the cake was good It is really really good We are really looking forward to our next trip where we can try more delightful baked goods,positive,109,100-150,595,500-1000
It was my brothers request to throw down on some ice cream here It was over 100 degrees outside so making an ice cream stop was well worth it It was crowded inside so my family and I claimed the first available tables The employees rushed to take our orders and were probably overwhelmed I ordered chocolate chip ice cream inside a chocolate chip cookie sandwich I savored every bite and didnt let any drip onto the table It was one of the best ice creams I had eaten It was interesting to learn that two Asian chicks left Wall Street to follow their culinary dreams of opening up Sweet Republic,positive,111,100-150,607,500-1000

What a lovely stop in the area near the Linq in the promenade and near the High Roller We had just come from the High Roller and I was trying relax after that This place is a mecca for chocolate We decided to by the Ghirardelli squares and they were sold by the pound so then we felt compelled to buy a pound In retrospect dont do this Get a few and be done We had chocolate every day for days Probably not what the doctor ordered It was oh so good however We also had hot chocolate there That was very tasty They want to put whipping cream on everything so if you are not into that catch them quick or you will have so much whipped topping people may mistake you for St Nick In all seriousness this is a cute spot with tasty delights I can see why they included this in the shopping promenade I will definitely stop in again,positive,164,150-200,843,500-1000
What a let down it is 24 hours but the Salted caramel brownie was the only star worthy item I tried No one in my party liked any of the pastries or tarts they were bland and the texture was off In fact one of them sat in our hotel room one bite taken never to be finished becasue we were so disappointed with the pastry qualityNot worth the calorie splurge,negative,71,50-75,366,<500
I used to swear by this place Everything was amazing Lately however I am so disappointed on how its been going down hill So many peoples favorite is the salted caramels and they are always out of them And many other popular items seem to always be out as well The owner must not understand supply and demand Also they only ever have one person working making it unorganized and slow The product is good but about everything else is not,negative,81,75-100,443,<500
Cool place to grab some ice cream at the Memorial Union Terrace Decent size lines even on weekdays Decided to get the mint chocolate oreo ice cream Love this flavor chocolate chips can get boring sometimes but the oreo mix clashes my two favorite ice cream flavors together cookies and cream and mint chip The free cake cone is also a fun addition especially when you reach the end of your treat and the ice cream has softened up the cake cone Its a great refreshing snack as you enjoy the view from the Terrace Theres ample sitting outside but if you want that AC life then dont worry because theres an ample amount of those seats too Or you can grab the ice cream and take a stroll around the UW campus beautiful campus with unique architecture,positive,138,100-150,764,500-1000
This place was so good  I come here often with my kid after practice before covid hit This is our first time Coming after covid What happened So many places taste so different after covid including this place The guy with long hair serviced us He was not friendly and seems like he hated his job or had a bad day Didnt appreciate him flinging his hair back then grabbing our desserts WTH This grossed me out I am not those type that would confront him or say something When I saw that I didnt ordered more I cancelled Some of The desserts he has not grabbed If the OWNER IS READING THIS hair nets please I paid for food that I didnt eat,negative,125,100-150,664,500-1000
More worker does not equal faster service This place needs to hire some workers that know what theyre doing It should not take 30 mins to package a few canollis and some cupcakes I had to wait 40 mins in line and 20 mins for my order to be packaged but the workers accidentally smashed a few things so it took another 10mins for them to figure their shit out I ended up canceling half of my order because it took so goddamn long Its very off putting when youve been waiting for a very long time only to see the workers just standing around talking to each other and slowly putting your order together The desserts are mediocre but the lobster tail is pretty bomb Totally not worth the wait though,negative,132,100-150,710,500-1000

The ice cream is good but the service is terrible We were in the area and decided to pickup 2 quarts cocount cream pie and oreo The problem is that we had to wait 20 minutes to get our order for a line that was 6 deep and 3 guys working behind the counter If you decide to go you can have my space in line we wont be back,negative,70,50-75,332,<500
The ice cream is always amazing and the staff they usually have on is great except for whoever picked up the phone today I wanted to pick up some ice cream but before driving 35 minutes to get there I thought Id give them a call to see if I could do a pick up or at least to see if the flavor I wanted was in stock they were out on my last trip so I dont want to make an hour long round trip for nothing Were not taking pickup orders I dont have the staff CLICK I get your busy and all but you hung up before I could even ask another question Why do you pick up the phone in the first place if youre gonna hang up on customers,negative,134,100-150,638,500-1000

There is no denying that Amelies is the current it spot in Charlotte At night you will wait in line no less than 30 min for a treat Ive been here several times and do love the macaroons But will never understand the line The reason for my low review is simple Great food does not make up for rude staff Most recently I took my fiance here for a birthday goody When we did finally get up to order one order taker skipped us and went to the older couple behind us When we did get help I made mention that it was her birthday I asked if she got anything for that as I over heard the order taker offer it to another patron for their birthday We again got ignored I just dont find this acceptable Treat people with respect I dont care how long the line is,negative,151,150-200,766,500-1000
Best ice cream No there are other choices in the Las Vegas area that are just as good But customer service is terrible and MAYBE not because of the servers fault Its the store policy My daughter her friend and I went into the store to buy ice cream cones The server takes our order and hands the cone to my daughter and her friend Well the scoop of ice cream falls out of the cone and onto the floor We made it a point to tell the server the ice cream just fell right out without tipping the cone He replied the rehearsed line its our policy not to replace the ice creamREALLY And this after you didnt smush it down into the cone hard enough so it could stay put or that the little girl didnt tip the cone over shes 9 So I had to shell out another 375 to replace the cone I think the goodwill shown by replacing the ice cream scoop for free is better than having to charge the customer more money for something that wasnt even the girls fault I dont fault the server hes following orders from the owners but taking good care of your customers is worth a lot more than an extra 375 You can always make an exception especially when its a young child How can you tell a child who drops their ice cream  clean drop no licks yet that they cant have a replacement,negative,249,200-250,1320,1000-1500
Horrible service definitely a listening comprehension problem in order taking Twinkie employed all of her mental cupcake ability to misinterpret the coffee order not understand that it was for in house and state they do not warm up pastries A planned leisurely breakfast ruined,negative,44,25-50,282,<500
The service is terrible I work in the area and have stopped in every so often The food is decent for a quick bite not amazing Tonight I wanted to grab a bite to eat before a meeting There were 5 people ahead of me with one person actually taking orders Two other workers were looking at a register down by the bakery Another worker stocking beverages and people working in the back but none stepped in to help orders go faster Five more people came in over the next ten minutes and still just one person taking orders It took over 30 minutes to finally get called Not worth it It was infuriating to see the workers just ignore the fact that there was a huge line and only one person getting customers food,negative,135,100-150,718,500-1000
Ive been here twice now once last year and I ordered a few cannolis which were to DIE for and I also got their rainbow cake with vanilla icing in single slices I enjoyed it so much that I thought that Id get one of the already made cakes they have ready for purchase for my mother in laws birthday The cake was just ok this last time in January 21 it wasnt as moist as I remembered but Im sure that could be due to it being one of the ready made cakes Im not 100 sure All in all I still quite enjoy this place and their many desserts OH they also have yummy iced coffee,positive,118,100-150,595,500-1000
Dont get me wrong this is better than most places in Charlotte in terms of bakeriescafes for atmosphere but the food and pastries are good at best The Croque Monsier was greasy and smelled like it was burnt in a toaster oven The apple tart crust was so tough that I could barely cut it and the French macaroon was as hard as a rock I could do a better job with an Easy Bake Oven The staff here isnt much better Everyone treats you as though theyre doing them you a favor Its a cool place in terms of the decor but the food and staff are truly lacking The search continues,negative,113,100-150,593,500-1000
When 85C finally opened in Las Vegas I was thrilled I love the pastries they offer and when my family and I are in California we often try to make a trip to 85C Unfortunately I am disappointed with the Las Vegas location as it is very inconsistent One day they have items you want and the next day those baked items will be no where to be found on any of the shelves The staff is not too helpful and several of them dont seem like they want to be bothered when you ask them a question For example I came in on a Saturday and ordered a jalapeno cheese roll sausage hot dog roll and a chocolate custard roll Came in the next day on a Sunday and the shelves were barely full and none of the items I got on Saturday were available the next day I asked one of the girls who works there why they didnt have the same selection as the day before Her answer was oh when the baker has time to bake those items he will do so Okay So my next question to her was well will he be baking those items anytime soon Her answer was I dont know its up to him Maybe we dont have those in stock now or he just hasnt had time to bake it yet What kind of an answer is that The employee didnt even take the initiative to go back and ask the so called baker if any of the fresh bread were available Just gave a random answer to me as if she could care less and didnt want to go the extra mile to do her job Their tea machine was also out of ice and had not been working for a few days so I couldnt get to try any of their teas If corporate or management reads this a lot needs to be done as far as consistency goes with the menu being available I will not make a trip to this establishment knowing that staff is not prepared or doesnt even know when their items will be made Staff needs to be trained better and wait times need to be worked on I still dont get the line deal when its not that busy I was waiting outside on a Sunday and it wasnt even full inside If 85 degrees wants to make it big in Vegas they need a lot to work on or its adios to their store,negative,423,300- 500,2097,2000+
I came here two days in a row once in the evening and once in the morning Definitely your selections are greater in the morning Due to COVID19 you cannot dine indoors but there are plenty of outdoor patio seating near the road and plenty of parking for this location Follow the signs to place your order while physically distanced Masks are required for entry If you order a beverage it should be ready pretty quick within 3 to 5 minutes I ordered the spinach and asiago tartine and you get two pieces if you get the half size I loved it It was made fresh so it took a while for me to get my order from the kitchen in the morning when there was a line of people Their macarons have great flavor but its not something extraordinary to not raise anyones expectation However theyre still a great choice Also if you sign up with them for your birthday youll get 5 to spend within a limited time frame Go a treat yourself,positive,175,150-200,944,500-1000
LONG LINES But its so worth it This dessert bar is every sweet tooths dream and its open 24 HOURS Everything I tried is delish Their tarts mini mousse macaroons They have delicious creme brÃlÃe and the best Napoleon I have ever tasted 5 Stars and nothing less,positive,48,25-50,280,<500
I cant express how thoroughly disappointed I was The cream puff my daughter ordered was significantly smaller than the one in the display My eclair was cold I could tell it was old because the filling separated and water was running from the filling Next time Ill eat at home,negative,50,25-50,282,<500
I cannot possibly understand how this place has so many good reviews Yes the food is okay but certainly nothing great Ive been there twice one time for something sweet and another time for breakfast The sweets were okay but breakfast was lame We waited in line for over 15 minutes to get microwave French toast with cheap syrup in plastic containers just like a crappy fast food restaurant and food that wouldve been better at McDonalds note that I hate McDonalds and never eat there Its also rather amazing that youre confronted with tip jars Do they really expect us to tip after STANDING in line for 15 minutes and serving ourselves Be sure to clean up your own table because nobody else does it there The service is nonexistent  there is no service I have to believe that many of these reviews were paid for because if real customers wrote them they must have gone to a completely different place or live in a parallel universe This place is totally overrated Sorry to be a Debbie downer but save your time money and diabetes  there are better choices,negative,192,150-200,1085,1000-1500
Came here on a Monday afternoon so it wasnt too busy but busy enough where we had to wait in line for 20 minutes or so The woman had a bad attitude and no manners she worked extremely slow and the only words she said was what do you want and move down I had a peanut butter dark chocolate and strawberry crepe It was good but the service was terrible,negative,71,50-75,361,<500
This small French dessert kiosk is located behind the escalator on the casino floor of the Venetian The obscured location might be difficult to find but somehow we always managed to stumble upon it Without a seating area the line alongside the large pastry counter may be long but it usually gives us just enough time to make the right choices My favorite item was the PBC 425 It came with a layer of salted peanut butter with a ring of chocolate sandwiched inbetween two thick cookies filled with bits and pieces of peanuts and chocolates embedded here and there The centrality of the sweet and salty peanut flavor nicely intermingled with the dark semisweet chocolate The cookies were firm with a nice crisp and crumbly texture I am a big fan of peanut butter and together this sandwich cookie was a winner I also enjoyed the palm size French Macarons 350 and would highly recommend them One of Santis favorites the Pistachio Macaron was semisweet and carried a refined natural pistachio flavor The outer texture was crisp egg shelllike and delicate followed by an air pocket before reaching the base of the shells and its creamy filling Together the macaron had a good chew but the base of the shell was a bit stiff and thicker than necessary Comparatively I had better results with the Salted Caramel Macaron Well balanced the refined caramel flavor was sensational along with a slight hint of salt in the background The allaround contrasting textures of this macaron were also more consistent with my expectations I would love to get the Salted Caramel Macaron again but Im also looking forward to trying the other seasonal flavors The Chocolate Chunk Cookie 325 was not the best but still highly addictive This massive cookie was firm crispy and fully loaded with semisweet chocolate in every bite I wished the crispy buttery cookie had a softer chew but the thick crumbly texture did not deter me from eating it all in one setting I would have enjoyed this cookie more if it could be served warm The item I did not fully enjoy was the Pain au Chocolat 4 The crisp ultra flaky airy and soft textures were impressive and nicely accompanied by a hint of salt and buttery flavor However there were only two tiny strips of chocolate embedded at the bottom of the croissant To date Amandine Patisserie still has my favorite Pain au Chocolat I also do not recommend the Cinnamon Roll 4 The layers were too dense stiff and cakelike without the yeasty airy dimensions to render that soft gooey cinnamon wow factor The TLC 325 made with pecan cinnamon and rolled oats had a onedimensional earthy flavor without some other ingredients to complicate the overall profile I tried but did not finish the cookie Overall their desserts were more buttery than sugary with impressive level of balance in the flavors and textures across each ingredient It wasnt necessarily a refined experience in every bite but there was still plenty to like about their pastries and desserts Service was to the point and prompt on each of our visits I hope to return soon to try their Grilled Cheese Sandwich KouignAmann Thomas Keller Oreo and Seasonal Ãclairs and Tarts,positive,546,500+,3247,2000+
Friendly staff But The cookies cakes etc were not only overrated but not even yummy I got a couple cookies and they were all rock hard Seriously a cookie from a famous bakery Dont get me wrong I love Cake Boss and was excited to go but I was totally disappointed with even the basic baked goods,negative,57,50-75,310,<500
Cinnamon Cherie def doesnt look like the picture Plus cold Plus had to be remade Sad because i first came here and it was wonderful today i brought my sister visiting from Miami and was embarrassed Not only was everything slow the drinks were cold her same drink for here was given in a Togo cup We asked for our croissants warmed and that was not to the servers liking Just uncomfortable experience today,negative,74,50-75,416,<500
Prestis is a pretty good bakery with many meal choices as well as baked goods sandwiches salads pizzas soup  I especially like the ganache and other cookies to keep me happy while I study The small cheesecakes are tasty as well and there are a few options It gets busy weekend evenings but is generally well worth the wait I feel like there could be more options but I am fairly happy with the choices here,positive,77,75-100,418,<500
So over rated Ice cream sandwich is made with crapy Safeway cookies Just not good And you cant even see any ice cream to pick it Its just a list on the board,negative,33,25-50,167,<500
Disappointed with the safety measures No markings for line control and spacing With no markings on floor people are invading my space and is standing too close to me The help appeared caotic and did not make any sense Manager should step in and have some common sense and instruction of the workers taking orders bagging items and cashier The lobster tail is my favorite although a little smaller than usual Very disappointed w the quality and quantity of work Do better Carlo,negative,83,75-100,488,<500
The staff is great the doughnuts look great and I got there at 11amThat being said I have read all the hype of this place and purchased two doughnutsWellI tried them and tossed them in the garbageIt is not that they are bad they are just not goodI got blueberry and meyer lemon and it had no real lemon flavor So one small taste and in the garbage I tried the Butterfinger and Chocolate and one taste in the garbage I will try it again to get more of the classic flavors But to date I have tried all the doughnuts in Vegas and there are much better choices I believe,negative,111,100-150,591,500-1000
What a great place The ice cream was outstanding and very creamy They had some unique flavors that were really good The owner Gina dont know if I spelled her name right was very nice We spent some time talking with her and she was very friendly We will definitely return when we come back to Phoenix We came back again when we came back to Phoenix They were again amazing We spoke with Gina again and got to meet some of her beautiful family This is a special place,positive,90,75-100,480,<500
If you are a TV star specializing in baked goods you are expected to deliver great quality and unique tasting foods This was not quality food it did not taste unique to grocery store bought baked goods Sorry but true Ive tasted better desserts,negative,44,25-50,250,<500
Ice cream is delicious cookies might be even better I dont know ok they tie Go to try it cant go wrong with homemade AND on the cheaper side shocked to pay less than 20 for 4 ice creams with cookies Great place,positive,43,25-50,227,<500
The drinks here are so creative and so good I love the ice cream here as well because the mix ins are crunched up and goes great with the ice cream I love the butterfly rose lemonade but everything Ive gotten from here has been pretty great I love that theyre open right now with everything going on And they provide hand sanitizer AND sanitizer wipes A little on the pricey side for the drinks but worth it,positive,78,75-100,415,<500
Long wait for OK ice cream I stood in line for 20 minutes and watched two families cut in front of everyone because they knew someone Ended up leaving out of frustration The new owners need to take a course on process management or hire on someone who is an expert in the subject It is interesting how Culvers which has equally as good custard can get me in and out in minutes but I have to make a calendar appointment if I want to try Jarlings again,negative,88,75-100,459,<500
I was very excited to go buy a cake for my brother in law And boy was I wrong  No one greeted me lines were long no ambient music A female employee saw me put down the tray full of bread that I carefully selected while I looked at the cakes and she swiftly took it away I was about to buy a 35 cake and this was so rude that I just walked out She clearly saw me set it down and look at the cakes she should have at least asked me if I didnt want the bread For a business who has been vehemently strict due to covid its obscene that the female employee just put the bread back on the shelf for other customers to purchase Also BEWARE with the specials they have its usually bread that is due to expire the same day Needless to say they have lost a loyal employee Moving forward I will shop at local bakeries not at chain company bakeries,negative,171,150-200,859,500-1000
Delicious donuts and a wide variety of options You wont be disappointed We got a dozen donuts The maple bacon red velvet and raised maple were my favorites,positive,28,25-50,162,<500
I adore Masons ice cream Not only are they great people but they make great ice cream too They are always trying new and different flavors From olive oil to earl gray I was blown away by the Cleveland Whiskey ice cream It packed every bit of whiskey flavor without any of the heat you get from drinking whiskey What a great way for nonwhiskeydrinkers to see why Cleveland Whiskey is flying off the shelves They get creative with the toppings as well You would not believe how good sriracha sauce can be on ice cream until you try it It adds just a little kick and a lot of flavor to the vegan vanilla That is another great thing  they make lots of different vegan flavors There is always something fun for vegans to try like avocado or roasted banana Flavor flavor flavor There is nothing like small batch ice cream With Masons Creamery you get beautiful subtle flavors coming through in each bite like a complex wine Ill take that over the oversugared and overprocessed stuff any day,positive,181,150-200,1011,1000-1500
Went here excited thinking sweets would be some of the best and wow were we wrong This place is super over priced the Cannolis werent good I got enough for my whole family and no one liked them Wont be going back to this place not worth it at all,negative,50,25-50,253,<500

Terrible My friend and I both found small black hairs in our sandwiches I have long brown hair and she has long blonde hair Ewwww Never going back,negative,28,25-50,151,<500
This place has the best pastries I have had in a long time We came here after a night walking the strip and it was no surprise why there was such a long line Their pastries taste fresh and their chantillÃ was so soft and fluffy with a perfect balance of sweetness It was a creamy texture and had I known it was going to be so good I would have ordered a whole lot more The staff is friendly patient and clearly love what they do,positive,87,75-100,437,<500
I first read about Bouchon a few months ago while perusing the blog of a really awesome food blogger Breakfast is the most important meal of the day so I figured Id start my day properly with a visit to Bouchon Bakery I didnt feel like blowing my funds on a full sitdown brunch so the bakery downstairs was the next best thing Not to say that the bakery is cheap omfg Portos in LA but its a more thrifty alternative We picked up a tomatofeta focaccia which the server offered to warm up for us and banana walnut muffin Both were delicious The muffin was moist and not too sweet the focaccia was savory and tasty Nothing fancy but the quality was more or less there One day I think Ill actually venture up into the restaurant but for my first Vegas trip the bakery would suffice  If youre passing through the Venetian go ahead and pick up a snack while you browse the interesting and eclectic assortment of goods that you probably cant afford,positive,177,150-200,980,500-1000
I tried the canoli 395pastry from here and it was so good The place was a mad house just like it is on TV but the employees are friendly and attentive There was just enough variety to choose from based on the size of the store which wasnt too bad I would go back again to try more baked goods,positive,60,50-75,305,<500
Best ice cream especially on Tuesday 2 scoops cant beat the price Ive been here quite a few times and their ice cream never fails in flavors Some specialties are gram central station monkey business blueberry cobbler and bday cake the lines are somewhat long at times but they move quickly,positive,51,50-75,296,<500
This is probably the best ice cream in Las Vegas area We tried chocolate and salty caramel and both were on point Service was good and the scoops are big enough,positive,31,25-50,163,<500
Im new in town and I love ice cream I was excited to try this place because of the great reviews I ordered a QT of Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramel as well as the pineapple Sundae to go The Sundae looked great but when I got to the vanilla IceCream it lacked the Vanilla and sugar and tasted like creamy milk I thought maybe I got a bad badge of vanilla IceCream But when I finally tried the Black Cherry and the Chocolate Malt with Caramelboth were underwhelming as well All the IceCream I ordered lacked sugar and how theyre supposed to taste The Black Cherry tasted just like the vanilla IceCream but with cherries and reddish food coloring and the chocolate malt was also lacking something Im glad I tried this place but I wont be back sadly I gave it two stars because of how long I waited in line and how much I spent It was edible and wasnt bad but it wasnt good either,negative,172,150-200,922,500-1000
Best place ever Loved this place as a kid One of the few things I miss about Champaignhaha,positive,18,<50,96,<500
This is a tiny establishment with some outdoor benches They offer a fair number of flavors I had the fruity pebbles and birthday cake on a waffle cone which was delicious but with a bottle of water it came out to 9 I only had two scoops and this IS NOT gelato SUPER PRICEY ,negative,55,50-75,281,<500
The pastries here are delicious specifically the chocolate covered cannoli They are slightly pricey otherwise I would have given them a 5 star,positive,23,<50,147,<500
My daughter takes me here every Mothers Day Sort of like a tradition with us It can be very busy on the weekends but its worth the wait The prices are reasonable n the salted caramel brownie is AWESOME The decor is funky n cute I love the chandeliers made out of utensils n things I almost bought at shirt with the place on it to advertise for them lol You wont be disappointed,positive,74,50-75,388,<500
Um perfect I didnt know that Charlotte had a place like this I never met a baked good I didnt like but Amelies was still way beyond my greatest expectations I limited my goodies to a coconut macaroon and an apple turnover but will be back for one of the fruit tart things that I didnt have time for I would live on pastries if I could but I needed the sustenance of a sandwich too Any restaurant offering multiple forms of brie is obviously perfect so I trusted them with something a little adventurous brie turkey and cranberry relish My trust was well placed I will be back next week,positive,111,100-150,604,500-1000
Ive always been a fan of Sprinkles cupcakes and decided to get a customized dozen for my sisters bridal shower on 121617 Unfortunately the one time I needed the cupcakes to be pretty they couldnt deliver If you look at the picture of the cupcakes youll see that the S cupcake was probably still hot when they started piping the frosting The frosting was melted and all cracked up and it really took away from the presentation I was really embarrassed for the photos which was one of the main reasons for customizing the cupcakes in the first place Update 123017 Sprinkles has reached out to apologize and make everything right again Amazing customer service,positive,115,100-150,677,500-1000
Ordered a celebration cake online to be ready when I arrived to Vegas  The customer service was excellent They even offered to write Happy Birthday on it for me when I realized my candles would not fit right on the cake at the time of pick up I received many compliments for the taste as well I will definitely order again while in town,positive,65,50-75,341,<500

I finally decide to check Carlo Bakery and surprise my hubby with some delicious pastry On the and I just surprise myself paying 32 for two chocolate mouse cakes one doughnuts one cookie and one cupcake  32 Ok  I was thinking maybe because is so damn expensive is heavenly delicious  I was almost crying after we try doughnuts and mouse cake Doughnuts was filled with cannelloni cream and aftertaste was very bad I felt flour in my mouth Mouse cake also was dry not fresh at all I am glad I try but I am definitely not going back Vegas have much more and much better bakerys all around town and even we can by better cakes in our grocery store,negative,124,100-150,663,500-1000

This is the only reason to go to Las Vegas Who cares about the bright lights the big buildings when you can eat delicious ice cream I went here on a Friday night around 730 PM There were four people working and the line was into the street However the line move fairly quickly and even if it was longer I wouldve waited I decided on a fourth Cooper sampler which is by and large the best option on the menu I had blueberry cobbler chocolate marshmallow banana cream pie and Keylime pie The person who took my order was knowledgeable about all of the ice creams and knew what was in each of them I like the banana cream pie ice cream the best followed by the Keylime pie followed by the blueberry cobbler and chocolate marshmallow tied I also thought that the four items sampler was super affordable based on how delicious it was and how much ice cream there with us There is no reason to ever go to Las Vegas and not stop here for ice cream even if it is a little bit outoftheway The only other tip is to my knowledge there are no bathrooms and there isnt much seating outside so that could be a challenge,positive,213,200-250,1132,1000-1500

Parking I arrived at this location around 9PM at night and the parking was FULL Very hard to find parking and when I did find parking customers had their cars overlapped into the adjacent spot So yeah it aggravated me just a little Inside the Cafe First impression Wow This is a small place It was genuinely busy The line stretched all the way to the backroom My friends and I waited about 10 minutes just to get to see the actual sweets and food Menu Its a cute menu Hard to read when youre all the way in the back Food Expensive Almost 2 per macaron  not a very wide selection of macarons either I bought some sort of chocolate cake while my friends decided to get the macarons My cake was 6ish It was very sweet I didnt finish it because it was just too sweet for me to finish The macarons that my friends bought were slightly stale They werent too impressed with the visit either It might have been just that night Ill try again when Im in the area,negative,185,150-200,989,500-1000

This stop gave me mixed vibes between a modern ice cream store and an olde fashioned soda shoppe Id say it lived up to both standards in its own way I enjoyed a hot fudge sundae with Chocolate Salted Caramel ice cream in place of the standard vanilla It was creamy not too salty had a perfect ribbon caramel and didnt become over powered with the hot fudge The whip cream was swirled on top by a professional A delectable ending to my evening and I wish we had a location at home,positive,93,75-100,489,<500

The shakes look better than they taste Very disappointing for a 8 milkshake I got the Cinnamon Toast Crunch milkshake and it literally tasted like melted ice cream Never again,negative,30,25-50,180,<500
Bit of a disappointment I got a single scoop ice cream cup and a lollipop for my son Came out to about 9 bucks with a tip Call me crazy but 9 bucks for a scoop of ice cream and a freakin sucker is crazy I will say the ice cream was very good and the feel of the place was really cool Cool idea having a ice cream parlor with an old school feel to it Too bad the prices arent on par with the old school vibe Churn is not for me,negative,94,75-100,435,<500
I chose the crack pie shake because it sounded like crack pipe Being in Vegas I thought why not Props to the clever naming It ended up being some salty and sweet concoction that filled me with regret I regretted it as soon as I received in in some dingy plastic cup For all the fanfare that came with the decor they couldve at least thrown some whipped cream on it or had a plastic cup with at least Milk written on it,negative,83,75-100,428,<500
Every time I come to this beautiful cafe I am never disappointed The drinks  pastries are always delicious If youre a matcha fan you will LOVE this cafe The customer service is always amazing and so helpful on any questions you have or suggestions on what to get from the menu And last but not least everything is so aesthetically pleasing and one of a kind especially here in Charlotte We need more cafes like this that give you the complete experience,positive,83,75-100,463,<500
I think I had high expectations for this place due to the hype I was really looking forward to trying their cereal ice cream I had a sample before committing to buying and it didnt taste good They use corn flakes when I think they should use Frosted Flakes Usually ice cream is sweet but this one was not The cookies I felt were good but not great my favorite was the blueberry one Overall I say try this place once if you cant make it to New York to try the original,negative,93,75-100,478,<500
This sprinkles has the worst cupcakes we have ever had from a Sprinkles location The cupcakes at the Beverly Hills location and the La Jolla location taste nothing like these disgusting cupcakes they are serving in Las Vegas I cant even believe that they are allowed to serve whatever this concoction considered and put Sprinkles name on any of it Save your money and go to the ones in California,negative,70,50-75,401,<500
Really nice place to get pastries They just opened up new seating space too if you havent been yet definitely visit when you get a chance,positive,26,25-50,143,<500

Of course whenever I go to Las Vegas like once a year I look up all the cool instaworthy food places to tryLOL This cute little place is located on the SECOND FLOOR of The Cosmopolitan Las Vegas I had a bit of trouble locating this but realizing the arrows on the signs I was able to find it haha Keep in mind this place is actually pretty small The Milk Bar is directly right next to Momofuko which took part in developing this dessert place I was super super anxious to taste their soft serve that Ive seen in pics on the insta from the NY location so I could see just HOW good it really is They serve pies cookies drinks with or without coffee and of course their soft serve ice cream Their ice cream is actually pretty pricey starting at around 67 You get options for toppings such as fruity pebbles or cereal chocolate chips and even sprinkles But still pretty pricy The amount they give you ALMOST makes up for that but not quite all the way My sister didnt really find the taste of the cereal soft serve appealing but for me it was pretty dang good but not enough to amaze me Compared to other places Ive tried Milk Bar is definitely up in my Top 4 Its similar to MilkCow in Fremont but a more sharperunique taste Its simple yet so interesting and different Id give this place 38 stars but rounded up to 4 because it was both aesthetically pleasing and appealing to my tongue,positive,264,250-300,1432,1000-1500
Why only one person working on a Saturday Came down early afternoon to avoid the morning crowd but waited 45 minutes because I drove all the way to the market and survived the parking lot,negative,35,25-50,189,<500
All I had was their infamous lobster tail Cream tasted good but the pastry tasted old Will not go back Im disappointed because I love watching the show and always wanted to try buddys pastry ,negative,36,25-50,197,<500
The service was really quick We ordered 2 mini red velvet cupcakes and one Cuban coffee cupcake but instead they gave as black and white cupcake by mistake mainly because they were talking and playing too much behind the counter Even though they got our order wrong the cupcakes were still good,positive,52,50-75,299,<500
This place is super mediocre I had one of the cookie cups and while I do appreciate the care behind the freshly toasted marshmallow on top the macarons were nothing special and the ice cream was really REALLY sugary and not creamy at all The texture of the ice cream was far too watery I will not be back,negative,59,50-75,312,<500
I have yet to find anything here I dislike Everyone that comes and visits me in NC is brought here and all of my guests leave raving about this place The atmosphere the staff the food every category you can think of would get 5 stars here,positive,47,25-50,245,<500
Large taro macaron cookies sandwiching birthday cake ice cream with sprinkles Great creation Sweet tooth satisfaction The shop seems like its always busy on weekends and they have a full fleet of young staff to keep the sweet tooth maniacs like me moving along in line This was one of those places where my first experience was so good I immediately got back in line to try another one They have a lot of options to pick from and even serve regular food like cold cuts grilled sandwiches and salads but lets be real nobody goes here to get that boring stuff Were here for the Oreo milkshakes brownie and banana split sundaes and yumee buns donut buns filled with ice cream As the customer youre the customizer picking your toppings ice cream flavors and macaron cookies Very cool trendy spot with fun and tasty treats Big fan,positive,148,100-150,856,500-1000
We came here for dessert after eating chinese nearby The place is very cozy with some high chair and sofa seating As soon as you walk in you can smell the deliciousness Theres soft technotype music playing in the background but not too loud where you have to yell to have a conversation We ordered the banana nutella crepe and the signature crepe to share The banana nutella was very sweet and Im glad I was sharing it because it was way too sweet to eat alone The signature was very good and that one I had the opposite feeling and didnt want to share It was just the right amount of sweetness with the vanilla ice cream and sweet fruits like mango and strawberry topped with chocolate syrup The prices were worth the tastiness If my daughter ends up coming here well definitely be back,positive,146,100-150,804,500-1000
Wow what a disappointment After waiting in the long line outside on the hot dirty city street My curiosity was piqued by the pompous display of raving reviews and endorsements But tasting the donuts I was thoroughly disappointed Overly sweet monotone flavors presented in shoddy mass production bakery style formulas An appeal to hype and popularity if this place has succeeded in anything its Marketing After dropping nearly 40 bucks on a dozen donuts I didnt find a single one that I liked The Nutella donut was filled with just straight Nutella Greasy heavy and totally inappropriate mouthfeel for a donut Would it have been so difficult to whip the Nutella into a Bavarian creme Lazy patisserie commanding astronomical prices,negative,120,100-150,744,500-1000
Hands down one of the best ice cream place in Vegas Been going here for a year and I just LOVE everything Ive gotten I usually do the single scoop or 4 scoop sampler Its so rich and creamy Fave flavors are coffee chip salted caramel and buckeyewell everything is pretty good Theres no chairstables though so u pretty much eat it outside or take it to go I wish they would eventually provide tables and chairs outside Overall I love the ice cream and most of the employees are pretty nice,positive,92,75-100,505,500-1000
Growing up watching buddys shows I was expecting the lobster tail and cream puffs to be tasty Instead they tasted old I could smell the eggs in the cream It was very nasty I took one bite and threw them both in the trash Buddy really disappointed me,negative,48,25-50,258,<500
I had a cupcake from here and it was absolutely awful If the line wasnt so long I would have returned it I took 2 bites and tossed it The cake was dry and the frosting was hard When I say dry  I mean it was dry like it had been left out for a few days because it was hard My Betty Crocker cupcakes with Betty Crocker frosting are much better than the softball I received I was so disappointed because I was really looking forward to it Waste of time money and calories,negative,96,75-100,479,<500
Mehhh nothing to write home about Truly basic flavors with a great concept It was reasonably priced and had seating outside along with limited seat inside My cupcake did not fast fresh and was a pretty heavy I prefer light and moist cupcakes but that was not what I got If I Sprinkles on my travels I will try again,negative,60,50-75,323,<500
This is for the store next to the gift shop Major operational screw up made a quick pick up turn into a 20 30 minute wait for nothing There was a couple of irate customers who did not receive receipts or their orders and held up the line The staff could have just remade them the order and let the line move on Instead they wasted so much time arguing and a big crowd was waiting I was waiting for my ham and cheese croissant to be warmed so had no choice but to wait And at the end my croissant wasnt even warmed Even if the food is good I will not come here again and ensure such bad service They should fire the operations manager for the poor job,negative,131,100-150,662,500-1000
My wife had a cup of ice cream and I ordered the Root Beer Float with Rocky Road ice cream That was the bomb Server was super friendly and knew his stuff Only problem is the parking We will be back,positive,41,25-50,202,<500
Owner could not have been nicer and more friendly Theres a reason this place has five stars  you will not find a better ice cream place in the state of Arizona We were visiting from Los Angeles and truth is this place would make profits anywhere in the United States Highly recommend this spot to any true ice cream aficionados,positive,61,50-75,336,<500

I was very disappointed with the experience I thought it would be better considering hes so famous and he goes around to other bakeries and tells them how to bake I love the show and was so excited about going to the bakery and then it just was a huge letdown The cupcakes were not that great I got a red velvet cupcake the ratio of frosting to cupcake was not good also got a carrot cake cupcake it was ok dont get me wrong they look beautiful they just dont taste as good as they look My daughter got a Boston cream pie it looks like something you would get at a hospital did not taste good and was really small and cost 8 The only thing I can say good about the place was the lobster tails were pretty good and the cannolis were okay The prices were way too expensive You would think considering he is at the Venetian hotel that there would be a shop to actually do shopping in but theres not the bakery is tiny and theres nowhere to actually get souvenirs and because the bakery is so small you feel rushed not only that you cant even tell where the line starts and were the bakery actually is in the hotel I seriously would not waste my time with this shop not worth it Customer service isnt that great huge lack of communication I have been a huge fan of buddies from the start but now I dont know what to think Im really grateful that I didnt waste the money to have the cannolis shipped to my house totally not worth it If youre in Vegas and the line is huge honestly I wouldnt even waste the time its not worth it Just disappointed I seriously feel like even if I was in New Jersey on vacation I would not even stop at his shop now because of this I hope that maybe in a few more months his bakery will get better maybe its just because it just opened who knows not even sure if Ill ever give it another shot though but well see,negative,364,300- 500,1882,1500-2000
I guess if you arent able to get a reservation at Bouchon the next best thing would be to eat at Bouchon Bakery Well not quite but at least it has Bouchon in its name and you can throw that out of your lips hoping people dont catch the bakery part and let everyone think you went to the real deal Located at the casino level of the Venetian this little coffee place offers up a small variety of pastries and sandwiches and of course coffee So instead of going to Bouchon for breakfast its hella expensive just have breakfast at Bouchon Bakery and call it a morning,positive,108,100-150,583,500-1000
My expectations were high coming in due to the reviews but really was unimpressed with selection and taste Ice cream was eh and cost was high Would rather get Ben and Jerrys from the local mart,negative,36,25-50,197,<500
I like to think of myself as a cookiebaked goods connoisseur so when I found out about The Batch Maker I couldnt wait to go I stood in line opening morning with my twin boys and enjoyed my treat and Tres Leches coffee Since then my boys and I are weekly regulars for many reasons 1 This is hands down the best treats I have ever consumed The Smores Brownie Cookie Dough brownie Oreo Truffle cookie and the pop tarts are all worth every penny I still have many treats to try 2 THE STAFF and CRIS they make you feel at home greet you with a smile and take time with each customer to ensure heshe gets exactly what they need 3 Kidfriendly There are definitely some coffee places that make you feel awkward when you roll in with two toddlers but The Batch Maker welcomes kids with open arms They have a kid cart which includes toys games and everything to keep your toddler busy while you enjoy your coffeelatte HOT They also offer storytime on Saturdays in the space next door with additional treats 4 Tres Leches Latteget it The Batch Maker is the highlight of our guests trips to Charlotte I always recommend our Airbnb guests to stop in and when they do they rave about it as I do Kudos to Cris and her absolutely incredible team and staff for making The Batch Maker such a special place for our family to visit every week Its our favorite place in Charlotte,positive,256,250-300,1400,1000-1500
Out of the birthday cake when I arrived Tried the birthday cake truffle instead and was not impressedjust overly saccharine nothing interesting about it Over rated,negative,26,25-50,169,<500
This place was unbelievable not in a good way Customer service was very poor they had a legitimate complaint and did nothing about it instead they pointed out that all sales are final on a recipe they did not give us We ordered a cheesecake strawberry preserve and it was old and the strawberry on top was rotted It looked like it was a week old the preserves on top were very stiff and crusty on the edges Clearly had been in the case for a while,negative,87,75-100,455,<500
Been here a few times and the desserts are definitely good Theres always a crowd and they can run out of some of their more popular desserts Theres a good variety unique decor and the line moves pretty fast If you come during peak hours it can definitely be hard to find a seat and you may have to stand in a line that goes out the door and wraps around the corner The prices I think are high for Charlotte theyre pretty much what I would pay in LA for the same thing but the desserts are good And its one of the few places in Charlotte thats not a bar but open late,positive,115,100-150,580,500-1000
Im going to give helpful instructions to the Counter Help If there are two customers waiting for help and there are three of you behind the counter and one goes to help the first customer then one of the remaining two should assist the remaining customer You should not be standing behind the counter talking I dont care how compelling the story is you are listening to or telling you are in a retail bakery you have a customer waiting WAIT ON THEM Is that really so hard And doing a yoohoo at me after I turn to leave in disgust Sorry youve already lost the sale Try to preserve some of your dignity The chocolate croissant and ginger cookie I bought down the street after leaving at Madison Sourdough were delicious I really do think Madison Sourdough has the best gingermolasses cookie in town My coworker Hi Monica loves your food I guess you wait on her,negative,158,150-200,894,500-1000
Finally got the chance to try Carlos Bakery in Las Vegas In the past everytime I came by there was such a long line I would not have the patience to wait A couple of weeks ago there was no line and bakery cases filled with lovely looking sweets I asked the young lady what the two most popular items were and I bought those She recommended the Lobster Tail and the Cannolis Well I was underwhelmed with both of them Ive tried these items quite a bit on the East Coast Carlos versions were decent but not nearly as great as I thought they would be Was especially disappointed with the Cannoli It did not taste fresh at all The shell tasted old and stale Id return again to try more of their goodies if there was no line Not worth it to me to stand in a long line based on this one experience Hoping for good results next time,negative,162,150-200,848,500-1000
So cheap but also so good Best bakery in Vegas hands down Could eat here everyday I wish there were more locations,positive,22,<50,118,<500
I wanted to try Sprinkles for years before I actually did So when I finally bought a couple cupcakes from a location in LA at first I was like thats it That is because I tried the vanilla first Later I had the red velvet and fell in love I was so happy when I heard we were getting a location in Vegas Finally It def makes sense Our location is the best Its located at The Linq Usually when something is on the strip it seems like a hassle to make a trip to just the one location you need but the location is pretty convenient If you park in the lot behind the high roller it takes a couple minutes to walk there so you can be in and out in less than 15 minutes if there isnt a crazy long line The store is set up with cupcakes on one side and ice cream on the other I tried the ice cream once but found myself eating around it to get to the cupcake that was on the top and bottom of the scoop of ice cream lol My absolute favorite flavor is Red Velvet Its the best I have ever had They have plenty of other flavors that change daily but I stick with what I love Another bonus is the cupcake ATM If the location is closed or if its late and they are out of a certain flavor you can go to the ATM Not to mention its super cute buying a cupcake from it Its a little more expensive maybe fifty cents because they charge for the single cupcake box Its so worth it though Sprinkles also offers delivery and curb side pickup from their app or website I havent tried either but it seems like a nice option,positive,306,300- 500,1545,1500-2000
The best cookie and cream ice cream I have ever had Ask for a free pretzel w your ice cream Scrumptious,positive,21,<50,109,<500
I just wasnt as impressed with this place as I thought I would be After perusing their menu I figured this would be a home run but sadly wasnt the case I mean the ice cream was fine But thats kinda the thing  it was just fine It wasnt BaskinRobbins quality but it didnt taste like the hype was justified I did like the selection of candies though Perhaps I sold myself short by not having the pretzel cone Oh well Perhaps a second visit may be a little more of the true Churn experience,negative,96,75-100,508,500-1000
Bottom lineCustomer service is great icecream is terrible The icecream was the worst i have ever had in my life It had no flavor and was soo icy it was basically ice Tried different flavors and they all tasted very artificial Very disappointed as i was excited to try this place I think they have the macaroons and the marshmallow to mask the terrible ice that they are selling I would not recommend it,negative,74,50-75,413,<500
You dont go to an ice cream place to lose weight or get a filling mealbut you do go here when you want to be satisfied cooled down and satisfy any chocolate cravings Ive been here a lot of times before and my number one favorite is the Malt Amore flavor which has malted milkballs in chocolate ice cream Delicious But today I got the Kitty Kitty Bang Bang which is a cheesecakeflavored ice cream with some cookie pieces and raspberry flavoring in it It was so creamy and soft that it really puts a lot of other ice cream places to shame The service is a little lackluster its mostly run by students who dont really give a shit to be there on a Sunday afternoon The guy I got today was kind of rushing despite the fact no one else was in line to get any ice cream and as a result Im putting the rating at 4 as opposed to 5 stars Despite this the place really is solid and I do enjoy it a lot Since this place is literally right around the corner from my apartment Im in trouble But oh will it be a delicious wonderful trouble,positive,203,200-250,1058,1000-1500
I would like to start that I think the cupcakeATM is an awesome idea Even though the cake part is just par definitely nothing special the icing is pretty good Now service Awful Where do these people get their training Where is thier supervision I dont pay 5 for a cupcake I pay 5 for the cupcake and experience If you are still reading let me tell you that a Sprinkles staff member was tossing around chairs because she was frustrated and hit my 70 year old mother with a chair I will NEVER pay another cent for a product at Sprinkles,negative,102,100-150,552,500-1000
Delicious ice cream I came here after a baseball game Its very bright and clean looking You can walk to the back and see where the ice cream is made They have huge machines that look like kitchenaid mixers I had the coffee chocolate chunk I think that was the name If you love the taste of coffee  this is a must It had huge chunks of chocolate and was very creamy and rich If you buy a container of ice cream to take home they even give you some sugar comes to take home Ah if I lived here I would definitely gain weight because I would be here all the time,positive,114,100-150,575,500-1000
On a visit to Scottsdale AZ I trusted yelp to search for a savory ice cream parlor Yelp has not let me down Upon reading all the reviews on yelp and how great sweet republic was my family and I decided to try it The Toffee Bonafi was a party in my mouth literally The combination of vanilla toffee brittle and salted caramel was a great way to end my night My daughter got the strawberry sherbet and the taste was bursting with strawberry flavor You can tell that it was made from scratch and no where near compares to any store bought strawberry ice cream I wish they had this ice cream stop in California If you are in the Scottsdale area I would highly recommend stopping by for a cool sweet dessert,positive,134,100-150,717,500-1000
Cool staff Cool looking donuts but tastes so meh for the price The small donut places around town with little to no advertisement are still way too superior 2 stars for presentation,negative,32,25-50,186,<500
super cute place  the outside eating area is nice and perfect on a cloudy or sunny day the inside of the store is small so if it is raining i would wait before going there is a parking lot near the store which is nice and the ice cream wall and fairy lights are so pretty at the time there was mocha and matcha oreo so i got a scoop of each i recommend both although i really want to try their taro thai iced tea black sesame and other asian flavors great service kind staff and color changing spoons,positive,101,100-150,518,500-1000
Came here after hiking around the park According to the lady the ice cream here is made with organic milk I didnt get a fancy dessert as I was having dinner in 2 hours but I can attest this ice cream is among the best Ive had Its creamy and importantly not colored I always check if the mint chip is green or white Bonus they have green tea and an excellent mango habanero for ice cream flavors and bubble tea,positive,81,75-100,423,<500
Wow very disappointed As i watch the show cake boss i craved for his sweets once i tried was not expecting the prices to be this high and the quality of what i got was horrible i had 3 different things and my boyfriend and i took ONE bite and end up throwing the rest away The price of those 3 small things was almost 20 Was definitely not what i was expecting wouldnt come back,negative,76,75-100,400,<500
Great icecream favors but they are always packed and only have a little bit of staff working The line is usually long to get served  the when my turn comes to choose the icecream I feel rushed Customer service isnt great,negative,42,25-50,228,<500
Wow Small shop with small selection of ice cream BUT really good Lady working there extremely helpful Fair prices for quality hand made ice cream Hard to find but again well worth it,positive,33,25-50,187,<500
I read all the reviews so we decide to make the half hour journeyreally wish I did not  First no Italian bread then I pat 275 for one macaron cookie which seems not to have made it in my bag then paid 275 a piece for French horns which were terrible needless to say Never again ,negative,58,50-75,285,<500
This is my 2nd visit to Amelies and their bakery items simply cannot be beat I HIGHLY recommend the salted caramel brownie I seriously considered skipping lunch and just eating like 3 of these Their sandwiches and soups are also fresh and delicious Amelies is a must if you are in Charlotte,positive,52,50-75,299,<500
Never had custard before Right when I moved here I searched this place out and was not disappointed Made sure to bring all my friends here as well Custard with mix in Reeses was awesome on a humid day and the place was always packed,positive,45,25-50,237,<500
I discovered Carlos Bake Shop sometime late last year while walking through the Grand Canal Shops at the Venetian There was a line that started at the canal and snaked its way into the alley up to the shop Upon enquiring with a couple of folks that were lined up I found out that Carlos was the baker from the hit show Cake Boss I had watched a couple of episodes of Cake Boss but I was not such a big fan as to line up for two hour so I decided to skip it for now and try it during my next visit to Vegas which is exactly what I did a couple of days ago This time there was a small line of about 78 people before me so it seemed manageable Even with hardly 78 people the line moved very slowly and I had to wait about 20 minutes for my turn My plan was to get the Lobster tail and Cannoli as these seemed to be their most popular items but at the very last minute I was swayed by an innocuous sign that said that our famous crumb cakes are available fresh only in the mornings As this was morning time I checked if they had any and on learning that they were available I decided to get a lobster tail 595 and a slice of the crumb cake 450 After placing my order with someone behind the counter I had to wait at the cashier to collect and pay for my goods which took another couple of minutes In all it took about 30 minutes to get two items which seemed too long The simple way to sum up the taste would be humongous failure The crumb cake was dry and hard like a cookie It tasted bland like they had forgotten to add a couple of ingredients to the mix The crumbs were a little better They were soft chewy and very mildly sweet but were actually edible whereas the cake base was trashed after the second bite The lobster tail fared much better that their famous crumb cake It looked like a croissant that had a nice cream filling so I bit into it expecting a soft flaky croissant with a light delicious cream filling The reality was a hard shell that shattered into small pieces with each bite along with a heavy cream filling that had just a hint of sweetness It was clear that these were targeted at the nottoosweet crowd but Im certain that even those that prefer their deserts less sweet will find these pastries to be extremely bland I should have read some of the reviews on Yelp about this place which would have prevented me from wasting 30 minutes here My experience has been that TV based super star chefs find it difficult to recreate their magic in a live environment and Carlos Bake Shop certainly reinforced that belief My advise to anyone who plans to visit Carlos Bake Shop would be to take an escalator to the casino level and get some treats from Bouchons bakery whose products you will find to be infinitely better that what you get here,negative,535,500+,2807,2000+
Overpriced ice cream Ordered 2 scoop cone ice cream but was not at all impressed The chocolate scoop tasted barely ok and the vanila scoop was worse The cake cone was way too small for two scoops However that was not a problem as I didnt bother finishing,negative,48,25-50,261,<500
I got the red velvet icecream with a topping of brownie chunks and a toasted homemade marshmallow on the top I liked my dessert overall Icecream good and creamy tasted amazing Topping I took away one star just for this they did not have a lot of choices in toppings brownies were not my OMG i gotta have this choice but it was okay lets get this because its the best among what they have choice They can surely improve on the topping Marshmallow Great perfect taste toasted the right amount I loved the place in all Would go again when I am in Scottsdale,positive,105,100-150,579,500-1000
Best ice cream I have ever had And Ive had a lot Really like the place toolooks like an old movie theatre on the outside Nice indoor and outdoor seating Very cool flavors to choose from and you can even watch them making the ice cream in the back,positive,49,25-50,255,<500
Been here twice for the halo halo and love it Im so glad theres an Asianinspired dessert spot that is so close by The GM here is super nice I love being able to sample ice cream and drinks But lets get to the good stuff  the halo halo is amazing Its made fresh by hand when you order so its not a premade concoction sitting in a freezer If it was socially and fiscally acceptable to get one every day I totally would But Ill stick to getting it as a treat here and there Theres everything from red bean to ube ice cream egg pudding beans coconut jelly etc that make it taste authentic and homemade The small is a good size equivalent to a short milk shake The large is pretty huge looks double the size of the small Both sizes have all the toppings proportionately They also have little treats like Pocky available for purchase Go try it out The quality is great and the price point is fair Makes it that much better yum,positive,180,150-200,956,500-1000

Im sorry to say that being this was the worst experience I had in Vegas The customer service is horrible On this occasion we where trying to buy a cake for my friends bday party celebration an this stop definitely ruined the party The manager was rude and kept ignoring me while I was explaining what I needed I will never come back here The service and the attitude we received from the employees were enough for us to go some place else If you want to come here I suggest have lots and lots of patience or just try a different bakery,negative,103,100-150,545,500-1000
This place satisfied my sweet tooth with a lovely display of its spread of offerings The oatmeal scotchie cookies were probably something I could have made at home but was nice to be able to pick them up ready to go delicious we got the butterscotch chip bars to go along with Not often something I find in other bakeries so I was really happy The hamburger buns were so soft and reminded me of my grandmas homemade buns I could tell everything is made with high quality ingredients because the two buns we didnt eat had mold growing on them after a few days on my counter unlike the preservative filled bread you find in a grocery store sad for me that we didnt eat them fast enough The cracked wheat loaf was very good also I live on the west side but will make a special trip to Batch if I am in need of high quality bakery items,positive,161,150-200,845,500-1000

Update To gain a better understanding of why the baked goods we purchased at Carlos Bake Shop were stale and dried out I visited this shop again just a few minutes before they closed for the evening to confirm my understanding of their business practices Lo and behold at closing time the shelves in Carlos Bake Shop were nearly full of baked goods that had not been sold off that day and there was no closing time discount as is the practice at other fine fresh bakeries As the shop closed items were still being sold at full price  and as they closed the doors for the evening the shelves were left full of items to dry out over night and lose their fresh taste and texture Shame on the owners of this establishment for permitting dayold items to be sold the next day to unsuspecting customers Given the exorbitant prices charged at this property isnt it reasonable to assume that one is buying goods that were baked fresh the same day Fine bakeries treat goods left overnight as day old  if these items are not sold off at a discount before closing or simply discarded they remove those goods from their main shelves to be sold on special discount shelves elsewhere in the shop No such practice is used at Carlos Bake Shop where you are provided a selection of old items mixed in with new and its the luckofthedraw whether you are getting a fresh item when you shop here As for the many fivestar reviews listed here a charitable explanation would be that these are customers who dont know any better But I find it hard to believe so many of these reviewers have never been in a fine French bakery that only sells freshbaked goods Its not as if there arent a number of fresh bakeries in the Las Vegas area and in many other cities so Im baffled by the large number of positive reviews for this shop Still not recommended,negative,338,300- 500,1873,1500-2000
The best donuts Ive ever had in my life Everyone Ive introduced these donuts to has said the same thing Obsessed with the simple glazed twists that they have pretty much every day but also love some of the fancier ones too Creme filled smores lavender YUM EVERYONE needs to go here If I lived closer Id probably go every weekend  they offer a discount if you bring your own container,positive,72,50-75,400,<500
Delicious dessert Not quite like a French crepe but very tasty We had the Super Crepe and the Chocolate Crepe A bit of a wait for them to be made but worth it Counter help fine but not super friendly if you want a smile with your service,positive,48,25-50,243,<500

The other day I went to Churn and it was sooo good I guess it depends how you like your ice cream but I prefer mine not to be as rich and creamy like most A good way to describe it is its like homemade ice cream Now I usually go for anything with chocolate but they had so many interesting flavors that I had to try them When I tried the Vietnamese Coffee I knew I had to get it It wasnt too bitter like coffee or too sweet It was honestly perfect for me hehe Id definitely come back if it wasnt so far but for now I can only reminisce how delicious it was,positive,117,100-150,577,500-1000
So we took a cab here because they supposedly have good reviews and I wanted good coffee I asked for a ristretto capuchin but they had no idea what that was and said our machine doesnt have a ristretto button The drink I got was scolded and burnt taking a full 30 minutes for it to cool down to a temperature where I could drink it The foam looked like phlegm the macaroon was inedible and the worst macaroon I have ever had according to the expert person in our group that had one All in all a miserable shop run by idiots,negative,103,100-150,536,500-1000
Great coffee Yummy donuts  my favorite was the creme brÃlÃe Will try it again next time So many flavors to chose from,positive,23,<50,125,<500
I think I would set up camp in their store if I could If you like their stand at the West Side Market do yourself a favor and go a few blocks down W 25th to their store It smells absolutely amazing between the popcorn baked goods and chocolates I took my mom aunt and cousin and between the four of us we walked out with just about one of everything I paired a bag of their dill pickle popcorn my personal favorite with a chocolatecovered Oreo in a cute ladybug design Salty and sweet goodness Mom got a chocolate turtle and was not disappointed We also sampled the cupcake truffles bitesize nuggets of happiness I took pity on my husband and brought him a buckeye cupcake which I was more than happy to help him with later Good thing they dont have wifi and tables I may never leave,positive,150,100-150,808,500-1000
So I recently watched the episode showing Milk Bar on Chefs Table I loved watching the chefs story on how she developed the crack pie It definitely did not disappoint The crack pie is buttery and Ive not tasted a sweet treat like it before I also tasted the Birthday Truffles and they were AMAZING I may even consider ordering these items to be delivered to my house in Texas for a future birthday,positive,74,50-75,406,<500
My boyfriend and I went here for the first time yesterday Customer service was amazing We had so many samples and the lady was happy to help The icecream flavors are unique and DELICIOUS Ive been drooling about this place still We had two cookie cups I had fruity pebbles and salted caramel icecream with a red velvet macaroon and of course the toasted marshmallow The macaroon is hard to dig through so we ate that separate The toasted marshmallow gives such a great flavor and texture to the icecream HIGHLY recommend We will be here again soon,positive,98,75-100,561,500-1000
This is probably why they only have one star reason to stay open they should reconsider opening up there little cafÃ,negative,21,<50,117,<500
Pretty disappointed in these donuts Im a huge donut person I went here thinking that it was going to be the same as the location in San Diego but not even close These didnt taste fresh or nearly as good Huge let down would not recommend,negative,46,25-50,243,<500
Very good custard as always if you like rich frozen goodness Look no further I would recommend getting your custard in a waffle cone you get a little more bang for your buck You seriously cant be in the ChampaignUrbana area with out getting some,positive,45,25-50,253,<500
If you are a fan of caramel or savory popcorn youve got to stop by Campbells in the West Side Market If you dont know what you want youve at least got to stop by and try the numerous samples  though chances are once you try a handful you get hooked The dill pickle smoky hot and vanilla butter not are three of my favorites The dichotomy popcorn a mixture of carmel corn and cheese popcorn is something youve got to tryTheres a ton of candy here too including chocolate covered jalapeÃos Thats a painful experience trust me,positive,99,75-100,543,500-1000
Amazing Needed and ice cream fix at around 330 on a few weeks ago and this place is by my work so no wait at this time either I had the amazing bramble berry and a scoop of honey lavender in a waffle cone it was AMAZING Definitely a great spot to indulge,positive,53,50-75,261,<500
Came here a few weeks ago on a weeknight loved it I tried the salted caramel very smoky but good and peanut butter cup even better They have plenty of options and offer free samples to taste before selecting your flavor which is helpful Love the space inside Definitely recommend,positive,50,25-50,291,<500
Read the reviews and was pleased to say it exceeded the lofty expectations Every donut is topped with a mountain of frosting and if loving that is wrong I dont want to be right I tried the maple bacon donut MM and Orange Crush The maple bacon was one of the best maple bacon donuts I have ever had mainly due to the excellent maple frosting not to sweet and not too mapley The MM donut was great I ordered to Orange Crush mainly for the novelty but was impressed by the quality its like a Dreamsicle and was fantastic Will definitely stop by when I am in Cleveland again,positive,110,100-150,590,500-1000
I went here whilst staying at The Venetian hotel over New Years Eve and honestly had a terrible experience I was very excited to visit the bakery as I used to watch cake boss on TV and absolutely LOVED the show I tried the lobster tail which is highly overrated the cupcakes which were dry and a few other pastries that arent even worth mentioning as I dont even remember anymore they left no impression on me Definitely does not deserve to have its own tv show there are much better bakeries out there,negative,94,75-100,511,500-1000
How Disappointing A French Bakery that makes awful croissants One would think they would make the best ones in town My advice for the best croissant in the area go to The Fresh Market And that is the only reason to go to The Fresh Market Although the product comes in frozen I know I know at TFM when they are baked just right they are excellent Some blueberry preserves smeared on it and Im happy I did try some pastries at Amelies but nothing to write home about I tried a baguette and it was edible I still can do better pastries and bread in my galley kitchen Not worth the drive from Cornelius,negative,115,100-150,623,500-1000
Tried this place several times with several different flavors of ice cream Each time I came away thinking the ice cream was average It is pretty softalmost a hybrid of hard pack and soft serve and melts pretty fast I would not say it has the high cream content of higher end ice creams Just does not have that special creamy goodness,negative,62,50-75,343,<500
Ice cream heaven It doesnt get any better than this Its so rich it could almost pass for frozen custard and is much better than most frozen custard and any other ice cream Ive ever had Ive never detected the slightest hint of ice crystallization either my favorites in order of todiefor ness Yippee Skippee peanut butter ice cream salted caramel ripple with chunks of brownies and chocolate covered pretzel Coconut Almond Bliss coconut ice cream liquid chocolate chips and crispy almonds Chocolate Marshmallow cocoa butter chocolate ice cream swirled with creamy marshmallow ice cream Cake Batter Fudge cake batter flavored ice cream with thick chocolate frosting and pieces of cake Fat Elvis banana ice cream peanut butter ripple and liquid chocolate chips You really cant go wrong with any of the options so ask for a couple of samples and follow your tate buds Then grab a double and sink into ice cream bliss,positive,155,150-200,945,500-1000

August 2 2014 Stood in line for over an hour for this Totally worth it No matter what it is that you purchase they pastries are all delicious and not too sweet My favorite is their Napoleon Their cheesecake is according to my mom better than the ones I brought back from New York Carlos is worth the wait and you will not regret it at all Promise,positive,68,50-75,358,<500
 dont come here they give you so little for what you pay for i got the affogatto and it looks and tastes like crap she gives half a scoop of ice cream with a little scooper and a shot of espresso in a little cup my friend got their famous cookie cup and it was not satisfying at all she got one 1 side of a macaroon and very little ice cream it added to one scoop of that little scooper she used came at 9 on a monday night 22717 PAID 5 for this,negative,96,75-100,466,<500
Ninetys Milkshake Bar is all that and a bag of chips Whats not to love about a family owned dessert shop that is heavily influenced by their childhood experiences growing up in the 1990s They are quite skilled at crafting unique desserts such as the Cinnamon Toast Crunch bread pudding and the birthday cake dutch mini pancakes I recommend getting both with ice cream Im afraid without the ice cream they would be too dry,positive,75,50-75,430,<500
I made my first visit to Fatty Daddys on January 8th with my two best friends just after the Phoenix Bridal Show I heard heard numerous good things about this place and was so eager to try and see what that was all about Unfortunately my experience was negative and I will not be returning The afternoon my three friends and I walked into amazing customer service from a young boy who was so kind in serving our sweet treats which were quite delicious We sat inside the establishment that day because it was a little chilly What unfolded afterwards blew my mind It seems that the mother of the employee came in to speak to the new owner about a few issues so my company and I paid no attention Shortly and I mean very shortly there after the management took the conversation to an altercation type level with raised voice and all WE WERE SHOCKED Owner was shouting blaming the young boy aloud for a broken mug saying he would not receive tips I could NOT believe my eyes and ears I felt awful for this boy and as customers we were put in such an awkward position sitting there while this was taking place Our sweet trip turned sour VERY quickly Its a shame We will not be returning and truly hope for the best of the employees that remain under the example of management we witnessed that afternoon,negative,242,200-250,1323,1000-1500
The famous jenis While they have some locations around the US this is the first time Ive been There was a line and it moved slowly but they have unique flavors that made the wait worth it And their waffle cones smelled and tasted really good Its expensive for a single 525 but you can do two half scoops to try 2 flavors,positive,63,50-75,334,<500
So past me is not a good person obviously Ive changed my mind about Batch Realistically I probably ordered the wrong things as in wrong for my palate My favorite is probably the honey almond tart or something like that Theres also the tiny derby pie that I love I would not be opposed if someone were to get me a cake from here for no specific occasion Ive had a slice of chocolate peanut butter I think and it was wonderful,positive,82,75-100,442,<500
In my annual visit to Amelies they once again failed on my order Everysingletime Kathleen took my order Waited in a long line ordered soup a half ham and gruyere tartin and a bottle of water to go plus a 2 tip Got the bottle of water but the food never came People before me and after me got their food drinks and bakery items 30 minutes later I asked for a refund Got the refund for the food but of course she didnt offer to refund the tip I will continue to avoid this place and encourage my friends to meet me anywhere else Trade and Lore Smelly Cat Burneys Queens Coffee Bar Central Coffee etc,negative,117,100-150,626,500-1000
This place is apparently a hugely famous Korean coffee chain thats all over Southeast Asia and was brought here to cater to the foreign Asian student population I got the Thai milk bubble tea and it was certainly milky There was a Thai iced tea flavorcolor to it Ill give them that dunno how well it mixes with tapioca pearls and for the price Ill go across the street to Basil Thai Everything in here was hilariously expensive I got a blueberry muffin that could have been purchased at Sams Club by the pallet for the same level of quality The place is clean the uniforms are cute and Im sure the homesick expats will keep it in business but for those prices vs quality Ill be going elsewhere,negative,129,100-150,717,500-1000
I was so disappointed since I have been a fan of Carlos Bakery for years watching the TV show My husband and I went in to get goodies to take back to our son and were not even greeted The staff today looked like they hated their jobs and we were inconveniencing them by even being there They had hand written prices on paper taped to the shelves for pricing on the mugs below these beautifully decorated dummy cakes The floors looked they havent been clean in a very long time On a happy note they seemed to take pride in cleaning in the actual kitchen area based on what I saw just not in the customer space Overall very sad to see a business that prides itself on details be so lax on standards in this Carlos bakery,negative,139,100-150,729,500-1000
Okay for the price but the spinach bread didnt taste fresh The guy with the beard was a little rude he laughed at the allergen question i had and without looking into it said that eggplant parm doesnt contain eggs When I asked him to please double check it ended up having eggs The two stars are for the price and the location,negative,63,50-75,334,<500
Im in love with this place Absolutely unique and just wonderful Every time that my family are in they have the most amazing favors You wont find better ice cream in Scottsdale Customer service is also wonderful Very knowledgable,positive,39,25-50,236,<500
First glance of their menu and I thought this place would be great Ice cream and other desserts based on the flavors you get after eating a bowl of cereal I was disappointed when I got my ice cream and it tasted less like a bowl of milk from a cinnamon cereal than it did a sickly sweet bowl of sugar I think maybe in trying to make it taste a certain way they overdid it Also how do you not give a spoon for ice cream You get a little stick like those tiny ice creams youd get in elementary school Its one of those places that asks you to leave a tip with your order even though nobody has actually did anything for you yet I HATE that For the price and the taste I think Id just pass on by next time,negative,145,100-150,717,500-1000
The compost cookie flavor is great note it has coffee whether you get the warmed up cookie or ice cream  the difference in texture can help you decide The chocolate birthday truffle comes in a pack of 3 and tastes like a birthday cake buttercream sprinkles and all,positive,49,25-50,271,<500
I tried the Compost Cookie and slice of Birthday Cake Both were wayyy to sweet and cloying I could not eat more than 2 bites of each I was so disappointed as I was looking forward to Christina Tosis creations I honestly dont get what the hype is about You can get better baked goods at any other bakery ,negative,60,50-75,313,<500
Im typically a froyo type of girl but every now and then I get a craving for the real deal homemade ice cream in this case Tonight was one of those nights and Churn really hit my sweet spot This little shop is adorable They squeeze a ton of fun candy and treats into a small amount of space but it works Per the recommendation of the friendly scooper I went for Churns version of an Almond Joy minus the almonds I had a half scoop of Toasted Coconut and a half scoop of Double Chocolate in a cup It was delicious A few bites in I decided to add one of Churns homemade molasses cookies to my concoction mmmmm I highly recommend this combo I sat outside on the front patio with friends and enjoyed every last bite while we were there we noticed big people and little people of all ages with one common interest ice cream Churn is a wonderful family friendly addition to the CenPho neighborhood Im sure it will do well and I look forward to future visits,positive,183,150-200,987,500-1000

I would have given zero star I chose this place to write my thesis But in most of the days they had no internet Which was awful,negative,27,25-50,132,<500
Weve had a lot of great treats at The Batch House since theyve opened The Oatmeal Creme Pie is my favorite sweet treat in Charlotte The Oreo truffle cookie is to die for too Somehow I made it this far and didnt mention the smores brownie If you ever want a great drink try their Tres Leches latte Easily our favorite spot for sweets in Charlotte,positive,66,50-75,357,<500
I went to the donut bar based on the yelp reviews Sorry 1800 gets you stale creme brulee donuts Stale coconut chocolate donut stale maple bar The two stars go to the bourbon caramel donut The only fresh one in the bunch Oh and the creme brulee is NOT creme brulee its a cheap vanilla pudding and not even tasty vanilla pudding Not returning to spend that kind of money on garbage I decided to drive out of the Las Vegas strip after reading the reviews God was i wrong to trust Either people were drunk when they came here or i arrived on an off day,negative,107,100-150,558,500-1000
Tried Donut Bar yesterday based on the reviews and really disappointed Paid 2650 for a dozen donuts and only nearby parking available was pay to park There was a few spots in front of the store and on the side that had no fee but no available spots A few of the donuts we purchased tasted good but most of them were greasy and tasted like they were made the day before We did purchase a couple of the big donuts but really not worth the price Should have a price for a dozen with specialty add ons Probably wont visit again not so much the cost but the quality,negative,110,100-150,573,500-1000
This is hands down one of the best ice cream places in Charlotte Not only do they offer traditional treats but they also have options that you wont find at other ice cream shops An example of this is a yum ee bun which is any filling of ice cream and toppings you want put inside a toasted donut bun They also have cereal milkshakes and just about any spin on a traditional ice cream snack you could want They also have macaron car cream sandwiches which is one of my personal favorites It is located at the boardwalk so you can grab a treat and take a stroll,positive,109,100-150,569,500-1000
Been in AZ for 3 weeks now and have been impressed by all the tea shops around From Rewind I went bold and got the matcha coffee which I usually dont get when I go to tea shops that have them Also went with a safe jasmine milk tea The Jasmine milk tea at 50 sugar was perfect for my husband and I whereas the matcha coffee at 50 sugar was too sweet Will probably get 25 sweetness for that one next time but overall this place was really good,positive,90,75-100,452,<500
Even during a pandemic their staff arent taking the proper safety measures such as wearing gloves I asked the cashier if they could put gloves on when making our four drinks but she refused and said they wash their hands  we watched and they did not Multiple people have complained and asked already and they only comply when a scene is made Ps it also stinks inside sewage gas is a health risk,negative,74,50-75,402,<500
Came to the Cereal Bar with friends and spouse on March 27 2022 Arrived 15 mins prior to opening time  they open at 1pm on Sundays only to watch a girl stroll in at exactly 1pm She told my spouse to wait 10 mins for them to set up She locked the door and didnt say anything to the 10people waiting outside of a shop that says they open at 1pm while its cold and windy outside Its currently 118 and still no word of when they are open or apologies for being late Horrible service,negative,97,75-100,494,<500
The fact that this fabulous bakery is open 247 is alone reason to appreciate it This is not anything like the 247 Wendys we had the,positive,26,25-50,139,<500
What a disaster Paid 56 for a dozen macarons and a couple danishes No big deal if the experience warranted it Pastries were stuffed in a box despite saying we were eating in Waited about 20 minutes for 2 cappuccinos and when we finally sat down we realized we didnt have any plates This resulted in us clumsily trying to balance pastries and my wife dripping sticky danish in her hair the napkins and sugars etc are tucked away on the far side of the place where the customers see herd animals are queueing for almost an hour to get mediocre pastries and coffees The 2 baristas took turns preparing a single cup of coffee at a time making the whole ordeal unbearably drawn out DO NOT RECOMMEND,negative,128,100-150,707,500-1000
I found your place yesterday and got an ice cream swirl Then I insisted on coming back the next day with my adult daughter and boyfriend I bought another ice cream swirl Daughter and boyfriend ordered a milkshake and a ice cream swirl in a cup Both of my cones were pure perfection My daughter enjoyed the flavor is her milkshake but thought it was thin Her boyfriend got a swirl that looked like it was in a childs cup I saw other customer receive their orders and get larger portions and large containers I didnt say anything until we left when he said he enjoyed his ice cream but it was too small of a serving for 6 I was alarmed to hear that he had not ordered your one scoop serving Very disappointing Update they are allowing the bf to get another serving on their dime Thank you for making it right,negative,154,150-200,824,500-1000
The marshmallow cookie Ice cream dessert is awesome Everything tastes great and it has a nice atmosphere My only issue was that rap and rb do not work as the musical ambience It was crowded on my visit and it was noticeable hearing suggestive lyrics how it affected the general tone and mood of the other guests I would consider matching the tone of the penguins and pink and green with a radio choice perhaps local radio of some sort that is more broad,positive,84,75-100,460,<500
This is a review for their shipped cookies We had a great friend ship some to us and unfortunately they were some of the worst cookies Ive ever had It was so dry unflavorful and just straight whack give me chips ahoy over this any day not even exaggerating Im sure its better fresh and from the store but come on If youre gonna offer them shipped at least try and make sure they are somewhat okay,negative,77,75-100,411,<500
Flavors were fake tasting I felt sick after eating it I assume it was made with a low quality dairy,negative,20,<50,102,<500
I really tried to love this place but Im not a fan I went here a couple of times to see if I would change my mind on the cupcakes but I was not impressed the first time and I wasnt impressed on the second time The cupcakes are just typical Nothing impressive about them It looks good on the outside but bland on the inside Kinda like when you see a hot guy and then when you finally get to know him you wish you didnt  lol And they also sold these mini cupcakes the size of my thumb for almost 300 seriously We ordered one of their drip coffees I thought that was the best,negative,118,100-150,589,500-1000
Big name but disappointed in product My friend and I are local came down about 730 am and was first customer in store One thing we noticed was the floors looked dirty especially since the store if fairly new I realize they are known for their cakes but I wanted a light buttery croissant and sadly what I received was a dense dinner roll shaped as a croissant We had a conoli also and the filling was quite good but the shell was thick and tasted like it was frozen or stale We ordered some cashew butter cookies and was hard like a biscotti maybe it is supposed to be that way The staff was nice and Im glad I checked it out but it was nothing special and didnt WOW me,negative,132,100-150,687,500-1000
I always enjoy a visit to Sprinkles especially on my birthday Not only are the cupcakes delicious with heavenly frosting the customer service is excellent I go all the time but last night Tanner I think I got his name right was especially cool  helpful  genuine He rocks Janae sp was also very nice Overall just a really nice place to go for a sweet treat  smiles  service and now I enjoy bringing my baby  our kids there too Thank you Sprinkles team,positive,88,75-100,476,<500

Was very disappointed for a company who is KNOWN for having allergy and vegan options to find out that there is NOTHING ON THE MENU that I can eat and I dont have life threatening allergies Wont even be making a visit when I visit Disney or Las Vegas because they dont have cupcakes safte for people with multiple allergies Such a disappointment,negative,63,50-75,352,<500
This place is over rated I only came on the grand opening day because I was in the area and my friend said lets try it waited in a long line was given menus to look at and then made up our minds what we were getting Finally made it inside just to see they didnt have half of the items on their menu they provided for us nice job Waited forever to get our drink orders and it was way over crowded and very unorganized I thought Id give it another go a few days ago with my daughter Waited in line again outside Ugh Luckily it was only 15 minutes instead of 30 minutes like last time This Time i didnt order drinks because I didnt want my visit to be a long visit again The first time it was a 2 hour visit for half off the items I wanted This time they still didnt have everything they have on their stupid Menu Seriously save your time and look up other bakeries in this area Theres way better ones literally on the same street across the street The staff is not friendly and the food is mediocre Nothing blew my mind smaller businesses in the area better selections better prices elsewhere,negative,214,200-250,1127,1000-1500
Having heard so much about it and being a complete sugarhead I REALLY wanted to like this place Its open 24 hours and the caramel salted brownie is quite good But after 3 visits I have tried several pastries and cakes and they are just ok at best and at worst kind of tasteless and spongyheavy The desserts are chilled and for some of them it makes them worse for the wear such as anything that is supposed to be flaky Cute decor does not make up for mediocre sweets I have yet to try their lunchbreakfast offerings so maybe this is what keeps other reviewers so enthused,negative,108,100-150,588,500-1000
Samplesss because there are too many flavors Chocolate Shoppe ice cream itself is fantastic Every ice cream variety of theirs is so rich and so flavorful that even if I venture out and try something new here Im never left disappointed My favorite flavor of all time is their Zanzibar Chocolate It is so incredibly dark and chocolaty and perfect Flavors I also LOVE Salted Caramel This  Just Got Serious Espresso Oreo Though honestly you cant go wrong with any flavor,positive,82,75-100,480,<500
After a long night of drinking you are grateful for your friends who decided to call it an early night and NOT go out One of my friends did just that So he woke up early and took the rental car exploring He came back with 5 boxes of donuts for our group to sample My favorites were the creme brulee But every single donut was heaven,positive,67,50-75,340,<500
I had high expectations for this place because they have one in ny I had order cereal milk ice cream and cornflakes I do not recommend it because it made the ice cream extremely salty And it was not worth 7 will not be coming back,negative,46,25-50,236,<500
Deliciouslooking selections of pastries and desserts Unfortunately I havent tried any of them as they are not vegan However the few vegan soups I have had here have been absolutely delicious Kind of pricey though so it isnt an every week kind of treat Usually seating is available if you avoid peak times,positive,53,50-75,314,<500
Wow So disappointing Id heard so much about the birthday cake so I decided to get a slice with my cappuccino tonight First the cappuccino was bad It tasted like something theyd serve at a Dennys or TGIFridays Next 14 for a slice of cake Wtf If its going to cost that much it better be the best damn cake Ive ever had in my life Sadly it was not The birthday cake was super average Maybe even a bit below average,negative,82,75-100,433,<500
I tried some latte drink honey bread and waffles The drinks take forever to be ready They have a weird serving system going on When it was crowded there was confusions about who orders what The ambience is good for studying and just chilling They were picky about the wiFi and I think they changed the password pretty often The honey bread is ok and the waffles is really soft and yummy However I think this place is so overpriced to be on a campus area,negative,86,75-100,465,<500
They got my order wrong I told three people the strawberry shortcake NOT the chocolate strawberry I pointed at it told them explicitly not the chocolate and at the register she said chocolate and I said no I told two people not the chocolate Charged me for the vanilla I wanted I opened the box and what do you know it was chocolate Mind you the vanillastrawberry thing was the only thing not labeled and I assumed it was strawberry shortcake but apparently wasnt exactly what it was called and thats what got everybody confused and it turns out it was what its called but Im not the one who didnt label it So they got my order wrong and the Oreo and the chocolatestrawberry tower I got wasnt even that good The vanilla cupcake wasnt any better The buttercream tasted like buttercream from albertsons cupcakes And mind you this isnt a bad review just because they got my order wrong and Im salty about it I was hoping the cake and pastries would make up for it and they sadly didnt You pay for the name and thats it Sprinkles has WAY better cupcakes Which is where I went after to soothe my pain of a terrible cupcake I spent 6 dollars on I got a 1000 better one for half the price,negative,224,200-250,1219,1000-1500
I think my life changed for the better when I took a bite of Churns peanut butter ice cream It was so good that I subbed it in the Smores Sundae OH MAN it was a darn good sundae especially with the addition of the torched fluff on top My only critique The big rectangles of graham cracker were kind of bulky and hard to eat with a spoon and I ended up breaking them in the container Id say pulverizing them to crumbs would be just as tasty,positive,89,75-100,450,<500
One of the true treasures of the strip Despite hus talents thomas keller doesnt let his ego get in the way of providing some of the worlds best pastries desserts and even sandwiches at very reasonable prices His macarons are the best in vegas and when i dont have a lot of time his turkey sandwich on a cranberry baguette with a hot chocolate or latte is perfect The pastries are as appealing visually as they are delicious A must try,positive,81,75-100,444,<500
I absolutely loved 85 degree bakery whenever I went to California to get baked goods I was really excited when they built one here in Las Vegas last year I went to the opening and a few times after that and everything was great Today was the first time I decided to order a cake for my brothers birthday Very disappointed I ordered a cake along with a caramel pudding lemon mini cakes and large pudding milk tea with boba last night for a pick up this morning My mother went to go pick it up today When my mother went there this morning the person at the counter said they dont have the order She explained we ordered online and showed the picture Then they came back and said they cant find it They went back to check 3 times and finally said that they would prepare the order The guy asked if we wanted the drink with boba and the guy said they would have to charge for the boba My mother asked how do you know she didnt pay for the boba The guy said because I saw in the order she didnt pay for it My mother then pulled out the screenshot I had sent her that showed I paid for the boba It literally says everything there in the email receipt that I did pay for the boba The guy didnt bother double checking and assumed we didnt pay for it He was about to charge us extra even though they first said they couldnt see the order and then was about to charge us for the boba because apparently we didnt pay for the boba I find that absolutely ridiculous How are you going to say that we didnt pay for something when you couldnt even find the order in the first place I loved the baked good but the customer service needs a lot of work Also what is the point of ordering in advance when they cant bother to have it ready for you Isnt the point of ordering in advance to be able to walk in and have it picked up instead of having to wait for the order to be made once you are there If they dont bother checking the online orders then dont accept it through online Or you know if you are going to set up a system to order in advance then check it Very frustrating experience,negative,411,300- 500,2126,2000+
This small little bakery is tucked underneath the staircase at the Venetian My friend and I came across this shop when we were desperately looking for some coffee We found it on Yelp but got lost trying to find it Bouchon offers a small variety of baked goods ranging from cookies to yogurt parfaits and cute macarons We didnt order any of the baked goods but ordered a coffee and a hot chocolate The drinks werent anything spectacular they scored below average for me The hot chocolate was made out of milk but it tasted funcky For Bouchon I expected chocolate decadence but I got none of that The only good thing about the drink was the temperature because it was chilly and I depended on it to keep warm,negative,130,100-150,721,500-1000
Liked that theyre open 247 in this sleepy city I went with a basic Croissant and iced coffee Trying to keep it simple and guage them on the basics I guess NYC spoiled me because if thats what passes for a great Croissant down here then I feel sorry for the patrons here It was tasteless dry and brittle It was as dry as if the Sahara fuced the Gobi and this Croissant was the offspring The iced coffee required a diabetes inducing amount of sugar to take the edge off of the too bitter Also note that the young wanna be hipsters here are keen to solely occupy and spread out on the comfortable interior tables that can house many people This forces people out of the well decorated interior into a long noisy corridor where you get to sit on metal chairs and listen to the worst music human ears should endure Maybe they do other things well but I wont be eager to come back,negative,168,150-200,893,500-1000
Quick service and simply the best Chocolate and Peanut Butter ice cream youll ever find After grabbing lunch on the Terrace why not stop in for a cup of delicious Babcock Ice Cream The staff are usually friendly and efficient and the price is reasonable for a cone or cup of your favorite flavor Mine is the chocolate and peanut butter This flavor seems to be hard to get at the grocery store but the Babcock version of it they serve at the Daily Scoop is the best Ive ever eaten It is the perfect blend of chocolate sweetness with that slight hint of the saltiness of the peanut butter Nothing better on a hot summer day,positive,117,100-150,634,500-1000
This place is NOT worth the hype I ordered the bday soft serve and was sadly disappointed My soft serve had a weird salty flavor and tasted nothing like a bday cake After I ate off all the sprinkles I just threw it away which was a complete waste It was definitely not worth 650 I also tried the milk and cereal soft serve and that wasnt much better The soft serve literally tastes like milk with zero hint of sweetness Save yourself the time and money and go elsewhere,negative,90,75-100,482,<500
Recently moved into the area and visited this place for the first time over the 4th of July weekend Have to say I was not impressed I ordered a hot fudge sundae and received vanilla ice cream that was too soft CHOCOLATE syrup not gooey hot fudge and the only toppings available were pecans or toffee On what is supposed to be a hot fudge sundae And the toppings were extra Sorry wont be back,negative,75,50-75,407,<500
I recently tried novel for the first time at a different location and was blown away by their ice cream donut This location is great and as expected did not disappoint I tried the fat Elvis and the coconut cold brew both of which were delicious When it comes to novel ice cream they just do it right,positive,58,50-75,303,<500
I have made every attempt to come here for either donuts or there churro cone ice cream and each time they are either closed or they ran out Im done trying,negative,31,25-50,158,<500
The donuts played a trick on my tastebuds the looked good but were dry and no flavor I was really disappointed because the came so highly recommended I tried the Strawberry split apple fritter and their creme brulee all three were dry and had very little flavor Their Hawaiian coffee was watered down The patio seating in the back was fantastic but the donuts and coffee sadly ended up in the trash,negative,72,50-75,406,<500
Love their ice cream always took the kids when they were younger keep it going glad to have you in Champaign,positive,21,<50,108,<500
When Im asked what would you last meal on earth be I respond with whatever restaurant Im feeling and ice cream from Handels Im thankful its 60 miles from my home or I would become a spouse like a house one of their cleverly named flavors I flip out over the flavors they come up with yesterday I tried pumpkin pecan and cinnamon roll Both divine My go to banana cream pie chocolate cake batter often times they have blueberry cobbler which is amazing and sometimes I go with a seasonal This ice cream is hands down the best ice cream I have ever eaten Note I just saw a sign that they now have lactose free ice cream made with almond milk,positive,123,100-150,662,500-1000
Very dissapointed work in the area so have walked by several timesthe place always looks busy but actually its not The counter help and cashiers are just super slow There doesnt seem to be any real system to get the treats I get the number system however its not working there After my number was called and I placed my order my number was called again 15 minutes laterthe guy asked what we wanted I told him we already placed an orderhe started bad mouthing his co workers Another seven minutes later our order was ready So after waiting 22 minutes I got my cannoli and cream puff Yup waited 22 minutes for trwo items that just had to be pulled out of the display case The treats were ok nothing to write home about,negative,135,100-150,729,500-1000
The sundaes are good but nothing out of the ordinary If you want good ice cream in Vegas there are tons of places better than this,negative,26,25-50,132,<500
Wow what a disappointment We drove over here to Fatty Daddy for an Ice Cream Social with a club we belong to The Ice Cream selection was OK not great and very limited Sorbets Their website makes it appear that they have every flavor of Ice Cream Gelato and Sorbet but the case only holds about 10 or 12 flavors When we rung out at the register our order was over 15 for what we thought would be 7 or 8 We had one two scoop cup and a single scoop with no toppings What a ripoff And the guy at the counter was totally unresponsive and unfriendly Well pass,negative,110,100-150,573,500-1000
Macarons to die for here I had to return more than once for them The beignets were equally as good but they didnt have any wow to them for me I think the prices are quite reasonable here for what they serve,positive,42,25-50,212,<500
I was so excited to try this place out after the Dbacks game on Tuesday after reading all the positive reviews We walked in around 9P and a friendly face greeted us before even stepping foot in the outdoor dining area I tasted the carrot cake cookies  cream  they were soo delicious The flavors were just bursting in your mouth I ordered a scoop of each and could not wait to go outside and enjoy it on the picnic tables I was raving about this place as soon as I sat down From the adorable dÃcor to the friendly service the mouthwatering ice cream and the adorable little Chinese take out box it comes in topped with a fortune cookie And then BAM half way thru my cookies and cream scoop a piece of hair I was literally off that chair  in my car in 5 seconds I was DISGUSTED I have to admit Im definitely more sad and disappointed knowing Ill never come back here,negative,169,150-200,895,500-1000
Great place for a coffee and dessert after going out in Noda I have never been for a full meal but the menu looks really good,positive,26,25-50,128,<500
The cannolis and the lobster tail were amazing I was really hesitant after reading all the reviews online But my husband said to give it a try anyway and good thing I listened Oh and their brownie O M G It was amazing Im not the chocolate fan my husband is He had me try it and it was so moist and it just made my mouth water Their customer service was good We were greeted and helped right away Id recommend others to go and try it out for themselves,positive,91,75-100,468,<500
Even the lack of credit card acceptance wasnt enough to justify not giving this place 5 stars The donuts were outrageously awesome Soooo gooey But the star of the show was the 325 apple fritter as big as a dinner plate smothered in sticky apple pie filling Dont go and expect to enjoy your donut in the shop because there are zero seats,positive,63,50-75,345,<500
They were at the farmers market at DTS  was our first turns trying them Each large donuts were 34 Hubby and I were not impressed The large donuts were nothing special but ordinary which I felt like it had too much bread and not enough toppings Ill give it another try maybe the selection we had was just off,negative,60,50-75,316,<500
Overpriced and bland Ive had better milkshake like Holsteins strip burger or even in and out,negative,16,<50,96,<500
I remember when this place wasnt 24 hours a day it wasnt what it is today by any means For me this place began as a perfect spot because I was always looking for something that was open late and the early hours of the morning But due to the hype and popularity of this place the quality has definitely gone downhill from the fond memories I originally made here Many of their breads are now sold frozen and I even received a Neapolitan that was rock hard in the middle making it unedible because it had been frozen This place does still serve a purpose for me when Im looking for something because no other places open however with the long lines you find later on in the evening it often feels more like a nightclub than a bakery serving great food To put it simply the best thing about this place is that its open 247,negative,158,150-200,837,500-1000
Found the gem by my place My wife and I just moved from Chicago and Found cute little ice cream shop by my Church The staff that works at this place are super nice and have great customer service Filipino desserts are my wifes favorite Loves that stuff so I go there weekly to get her something sweet So far she has tried everything from Halo Halo sagu flan Ube Cake Bubble tea and many options on the menu This is a must try place and you will not be disappointed,positive,91,75-100,477,<500
Travis and Brandon were so hospitable and have the best ice cream Ive ever had I had the bourbon and cheesecake so good Great environment and grade a customer service,positive,30,25-50,174,<500
Red velvet cake Tasted terrible Super dry Not moist at all Might as well get a preservative packed cake from Ralphs or your local grocery store Leave this cake where it belongs In a vending machine miles and miles away from anywhere near being baked fresh Shame on Carlo,negative,49,25-50,283,<500
Great place to meet with friends Everything I have tried has been great Love the atmosphere,positive,16,<50,94,<500

Very disappointed the only lactose free ice cream was not ice cream they only had mango sorbet Huge disappointment I feel that more and more people have allergies if one kind to another to bad some places dont accommodate,negative,39,25-50,228,<500
Salut Yelp ca va moi Je suis bien What can I say about Amelie other than its a really creepy French movie however this is a 24 hour bakery 20 FREAKING 4 HOURS I was so hyped to go here My second night in Charlotte I had to go I went around 11 at night and it was pretty busy There was a lot in the case I would have thought they would be empty NOPE The interior of the bakery was kinda over the top with RB and hip hop music I was expecting French tones Oh well thats not the issue here The pricing as okay not a fan of the pricing on the little bits almost 2 bucks for a small that can be eaten in one chew NO thank you The tarts however were yummy about 4 bucks or so which is what I would expect in KC it would have been 5 or 6 dollars My biggest issue the french macaroons The cookie was made correctly however the filling was not It was like they just got jelly from the store and spread it on And the creme was it creme Idk but it was horrible If you all every had French macaroons you know the filling is what makes the cookie and I wasted about 12ish dollars on 5 macaroons in which I only ate12 of one My gf ate 1 and we just left the rest in the hotel trash Would I come back probably they also have a real food menu too Ive give it a try again but wont be buying the french macaroons,negative,273,250-300,1343,1000-1500
Yes Please It was the Leslie Knope for me and the Dough Melt for my son Lovely owners charming service and the little kitties outside were just so sweet Even on a hot summer evening it was perfect eating outside on the patio Well placed and well shaded for those summer evenings We found a new favorite ice cream spot,positive,60,50-75,324,<500
When I went to the bakery it was very cute and a well put together atmosphere However I found that the croissant that I ordered was dry and hard like it was left over It was also overpriced I went back a second time to give it a second chance and ordered something else and was stiff staleold and overpriced Not worth the money,negative,64,50-75,335,<500
Id rather go to Dunkin Donuts This place is horrible and way overpriced,negative,13,<50,74,<500
This pains me to give Bouchon this review and I really hoped it was going to be higher as I had such high hopes I lived in Paris for a while and love a great croissant in the morning I heard there was a bouchon here and thought Id try it I also heard they have good macarons so thought Id give that a go as well If you like really good croissants dont get theres Honestly it tasted like a day old croissant from Costco Not that there isnt a place for those but it isnt at an extremely reputable patisserie More disappointing than the croissant was the raspberry macaron It is currently sitting here next to me half uneaten and I cant decide whether I should finish eating it or not If you have had really good macarons either here or in Paris you know it shouldnt be crunchy at all not hard but perfectly doughy and fall apart in your mouth as your lips close on it This macaron again tastes a day old its hardcrunchy and too cold If you havent had a macaron before dont have this one or else youll think macarons themselves are disappointing The flavor is ok however Verdict if you like real authentic croissants and macarons dont come here Tant pis,negative,220,200-250,1193,1000-1500
Thank you for coming to CLT I moved here from Columbus OH 3 years ago and Jenis is one of the absolute favorite things Ive missed the most So glad to have Goat Cheese and Red Cherries back in my life,positive,41,25-50,206,<500
YAY I am so happy this bakery is finally open in Las Vegas It is about time  If you are craving asian pastries  this is the place to go The bread is so fluffy it is like eating a cloud My favorite bread is the milk tea The pudding inside has great texture and it is not overly sweet The prices are also phenomenal costing about 100250 for a pastry The set up for this bakery is very cool You come in grab your tray and tongs and grab as much bread as you would like to purchase An employee then bags your pastries for check out and you are good to go I was also impressed by their other small desserts I purchased a cream puff and it was phenomenal I cannot wait to try their cheesecake They also sell full cakes I purchased a tiramisu cake and it came out to 33 That is an amazing price for a FULL cake from a bakery My friends at the party loved it Tip Popular breads do sell out  come early,positive,184,150-200,934,500-1000
Place looks like a good place to get bake goods large selection of Italian cookies and pastries Wasnt there for the pastries so I cant help you there I stopped in for a breakfast sandwich and was let downthree types of sandwiches to choice from already made in the case Was disappointed when they took my sandwich out of the case and heated it up in a microwaveI mean each to their own but I dont know about you but Im not a fan of microwaved bacon and eggs Was hoping for a fresh deli style breakfast and that was not the case I would go back to try a pastry but forget about going back for a breakfast sandwich Reheat breakfast sandwich reminded me of getting breakfast from the Cooper Library canteen when pulling an all nighter,negative,138,100-150,748,500-1000
Dairy Queen at the other end of Carson st is waaaaay better  The lines if any are never too bad Yall people that wait in that long azz line every night for mediocre ice cream lined up like sheep that wraps around the building are just stupid,negative,48,25-50,252,<500
Delicious Ice cream is not even one of my favorite desserts but Handels is in a class by itself Completely worth the 20 min drive for me Coconut cream pie is amazing Have also tried the chocolate cake batter very good and super rich buckeye vanilla with peanut butterchocolate yummy and graham central stationI didnt think a graham cracker centered flavor could actually be so tasty Service was super slow and the girl did get one of my sampler flavors wrong but I am sure it is just because they just opened,positive,92,75-100,526,500-1000
A variety to choose from but the prices were outrageous We got two cones without toppings and it was over 1400 The flavors were good but not sure its worth the price,negative,32,25-50,171,<500
Not impressed The crack pie and cornflake chocolate chip marshmallow cookie tasted fake The fruit cereal ice cream was probably the better out of the three items we tried Everything was outrageously overpriced for what it is,negative,37,25-50,228,<500

The ice cream was not bad but I think I wouldve chosen to spend my 10 elsewhere I was waiting in a cramped line when I noticed one of the workers in back of me said I said excuse me 10 times as she rushed to the cash register Immediately my friends and I were turned off In fact I was scared she might spit in my food for not hearing her say excuse me 10 times I made sure to keep a close eye on the workers as ridiculous as that sounded I normally wouldnt even bat an eye if someone couldnt hear me speak my order the first time I dont even care if they ask me multiple times I make sure to speak louder and clearer And when my order comes up it wasnt even the correct order And I just asked nicely that I ordered the chocolate dipped cone not ice cream in a cup He transfers my ice cream into a dipped cone instead of the cup but he doesnt hand it to me He pushes it across the counter so itll reach me There was no protective paper covering on the bottom of the waffle cone Honestly not a big deal for some but I thought it was a little unsanitary especially after the bad experience we were already having He couldve just handed it to me But hey at least nobody spit in my food,negative,242,200-250,1218,1000-1500
Located inside The Cosmopolitan Milk Bar is located close to all the food places like Egg Slut and next to Marukfuku Ramen Admittedly I did not know about this place until a friend asked me to get them something from here when I was in town So I figured since Im here might as well get myself something as well So I got myself a variety of the cookies and a slice of that bday cake The cookies are just okay in my opinion But the bday cake is fireeeeee I went back another time and tried their chocolate bday cake and I feel like that was even better than the regular one The chocolate is super decadent and just kinds of amazing Their stuff is pricey but I dont know if its because its a Vegas thing or if all the other ones in other locations are the same but I figured when in Vegas right Super side note if youre planning to buy a cake here and take it back to your home destination to share with friends and family the cake which normally needs to be refrigerated can be out and about for four hours before it goes bad I asked the staff and they told me that,positive,211,200-250,1094,1000-1500

Ive heard a lot about Bouchon Bakery but it fell below my expectations Maybe my expectations were too high I thought the pastries were nothing special and didnt make an impact on me They werent awful but not so memorable either Red velvet cupcake  wasnt even red more like diluted washed out red Cream cheese icing was good but there was too much of it I liek my cupcakes moist but this wasnt Ive had way better red velvet cupcakes Bread pudding cake  Presentation was great Looking at it made me salivate Tasting it however was not so great Dry and bland Chocolate tart  great texture but the taste once again disappointed me Some I can see why people would like this but it was way to rich for me Everytime I took a bite it felt like it got stuck to the roof of my mouth I want to eat chocolate not peanut butter Ive been told their macrons are good but I didnt get a chance to try it Maybe next time I do want to try Bouchon Bistro though,negative,185,150-200,981,500-1000

It gets 4 stars because of the lobster tails  cannolis and because I love Cake Boss I took off 1 star because of the red velvet cupcake which was just not good at all Im a red velvet snob and expected a red velvet cupcake from Carlos to be like everything else Ive tried there Amazing It wasnt Hard to describe what exactly was wrong but didnt even taste like red velvet to me Anyway lobster tails are my favorite hands down Theyre amazing I literally constantly crave them My friend wanted them to add some chocolate on top of hers when we went and they wouldnt do it but Im fairly certain that would be really good Their cannolis Mm so good I visited the Carlos in Hoboken a few years ago and had a cannoli so I had to try the ones here I had the regular one and the chocolate one Both are great My friend got a hazelnut covered cream puff in addition to some lobster tails and she said it was really good It is a must try for me for next time I spent about 28 I think for two lobster tails two cannolis and two red velvet cup cakes Also there were a lot of people there in a small space but they do try to get to the next number yes you have to take a number when you get there quickly I didnt have any issues with the customer service either Everyone was friendly I would however recommend a way for customers to be able to know what is in the display cases before ordering Even while ordering at the one with the pastries youre unable to see the cupcakes case as people are standing everywhere while waiting and vice versa I probably missed out on something simply because I couldnt see it and didnt know it was there After reading some other reviews it seems there is now a line to get in which should alleviate that problem,positive,339,300- 500,1786,1500-2000
Decided to stop here before leaving back home to bring pastries for family Ive gone to 85 in Dallas  Houston and the pastries itself never disappoint those are always good Well with my visit here everything was fine until I got home and discovered my receipt left in my luggage and i saw that I was overcharged I ended up getting charged for 2 extra pastries when I actually only had 1 So this is a warning to double and triple check your receipt before leaving like me At least the worker was nice enough to bag my things so that I could put it in my luggage easily and the drinks I ordered also were made fast But yeah dont get overcharged like I did,negative,127,100-150,667,500-1000
Ok so its really cool that they have vegan soft serve ice cream but I had the weirdest most uncomfortable experience w the staff while there with my sister Idk if the staff were new or not but it was odd for a first time going in there having to order with 3 different people before actually being helped even though there werent other customers When the third person asked me what I wanted I almost didnt answer bc it was like alright one more time but then they made my ice cream,negative,93,75-100,499,<500
This place is a joke We ordered almost all their popular pastries lobster tail canoli rainbow cake cup cakes and chocolate cake Spending more than hundred dollars only to find out that the pastries being sold at local grocery stores taste better than this I think their pastries are over priced Their icing in the cakes are really really sweet just like the cakes in the grocery store Canoli is not that good the crust is so hard and taste blunt not creamy Lobster tail is ok the inside is creamy I dont know why people are lining up for this Not worth itwaste of money,negative,106,100-150,588,500-1000
Comparing to diddy riese cookies in los Angeles nothing special imo The cookies dont taste like anything special the ice cream too Its a fun dessert area though,negative,28,25-50,174,<500
Yelp should let me put negative stars after finding out I was missing items I OVER PAID for 1 my pastries where stuck together 2 I was missing my daughters cannoli and 3 my chocolate covered strawberry was moldy I cant believe it I use to love that place I brought my kids from Los Angeles to Vegas and this was suppose to be the highlight of our trip Never again,negative,71,50-75,370,<500
These were delicious cupcakesmeeting my expectations for a 34 cupcake as I realize cost is due to the Sprinkles namesake The marshmallow chocolate with ganache was great though it wasnt really so much marshmallow as it should be It actually reminded me more of the filling in the hostess chocolate cakes from years ago The chocolate was dark the perfect amount of sweetness and definitely not dry I think this was my favorite even though it is quite plain The vanilla was actually disappointing in terms of flavor of cake and icing but was moist My husband loved his peanut butter cupcake but I didnt get to try it The cupcakes are both beautiful and simple,positive,116,100-150,679,500-1000
We wanted to like this place but there are just better local places to get ice cream in Cleveland  including Sweet Moses just down the street Their flavors are creative but the ice cream is watery and icy The flavors dont seem to stand out on their own,negative,49,25-50,257,<500
I have wanted to go back east just to taste these baked goods I wanted to know if it was really as good as everyone on TV was saying I mean come on people waiting three hours or more in line just cuz their on TV Well I only had to wait 45 mins here in Las Vegas and it was REALLY WORTH THE WAIT I havent been able to find a GOOD cannoli in this town to save my life You sure can here And the rest of the pastries are to die for Ill be going back over and over Thank you Buddy for coming to Vegas Its a much shorter drive to go to the Strip then to have to fly to New Jersey,positive,127,100-150,591,500-1000
If you want some good Chinese pastries I recommend 85 Degrees This place here has many pastries like  Pork Sung Bun  Giant Pork Sung Bun  Coconut Buns  Sponge Cake  Garlic Bread  Black Forest Cake  Mango Cake  Almond Cake  Chocolate Cookies And much more Everytime when me and my cousin go visit this bakery after dinner during the weekend theres always a long line We always buy a whole lot of pastries to eat for our family to share Their pastries are very soft and they dont hardened for a few days Yay If you are looking for a special treat for a special someone or wanting to get some pastries visit here But I recommend to come during the day time because if you go during night time their items are gone quick From my recent visit I actually got the last sponge cake Oh I felt lucky,positive,157,150-200,818,500-1000
Having lunch at Federal Pizza I spied Churn from across the street I had heard they had really good ice cream and it was worth checking out Well unfortunately I was unimpressed I opted for a ice cream sandwich I chose the salted chocolate chip cookies with cookiesnmint ice cream The two cookies were extremely hard and crunchy and honestly very subpar One would think in an ice cream shop that the cookies would be SOFT Nope This created a very messy ice cream sandwich and eating it in a traditional way proved to be impossible Every bite forced more ice cream out of the bottom of the cookies The end result was I ate the ice cream with a spoon and ended up throwing out the cookies The ice cream itself wasnt bad but it wasnt great either and isnt worthy of driving any sort of distance to eat The ice cream sandwich was definitely not worth the 700 price,negative,161,150-200,885,500-1000
Got the birthday milkquake and it was okay cause the Birthday cake chunks at the bottom of the cup tasted good but the ice cream itself tasted flat and seemed not sweet enough Presentation wise it looked unappetizing For 1083 for a regular size I probably wouldnt order the milkquake again The milk soft serve sample I tried reminded me of milk thats been sitting in the refrigerator for too long Next time I come back I will probably try the cookies,negative,82,75-100,460,<500
I think Sprinkles is the best of the cupcake chains For the most part they are very consistent This one is no exception and I had a strawberry cupcake and a black and white just as good as the original location in NYC I think what makes these cupcakes so special is the cake The cakes are so flavorful and moist I feel like they really stand out The frosting is very basic not in a bad way but it makes the cake really shine I will go out of my way to come herethen I realized they have an ATM at the airport yum,positive,105,100-150,528,500-1000
Both cookie and cannoli hards as a rock We used them to play drums on the box Only exciting part or use for these horrible deserts Not a wide selection either So bad we refused to waste anymore money at bakery or restaurant,negative,43,25-50,228,<500
The customer service and ice cream was out of this world Absolutely amazing I will definitely be coming back to try more flavors,positive,23,<50,134,<500
This is my second time coming here man oh man the hype is real As you arrive to this location it looks like more of a industrial construction area When I arrived there was about 5 people waiting ahead of me and this spot just opened like 3 min ago Is it that serious Yes it is that serious The oatmeal pie is my go to thing over here I literally could probably eat 3 if I have my stretchy pants on This is probably my favorite place since moving to the area Cheers to the owners for putting me in a sugar coma,positive,104,100-150,521,500-1000
After visiting south end Jenis lives up to the hype They let you sample as many flavors as you like till you make a decision I had the brambleberry I thought it was delicious There flavors change seasonally Next time I suggest trying the butter cake,positive,46,25-50,255,<500
Unwelcoming staff disgusting stale overpriced pastries The show and artistry is awesome but Im glad I was able to catch this place without a line during their downtime I wouldve been real upset if I had to fall in line for this,negative,42,25-50,235,<500
Best Ice Cream Ever Love the Graham Central Station 200 scoops on Tuesday ,positive,14,<50,87,<500
The froyoice cream here was delicious Very good and paired it with some of the cookies The cookies are unique and delicious I got one of every cookie The staff also let me try the different yogurt flavors and some of the toppings before deciding what I wanted for my order The place gets a long line so be prepared to wait a bit,positive,64,50-75,337,<500
Giving one star just for the ice cream itself Came her on a Wednesday night with excitement to try the sundaes The cashier lady on the picture did not greet at all On top of that I know I said it maybe a second late to ask for military discount but she completely ignored me I could tell she heard me because i was literally next to her and even leaned over to say excuse me do you have military discount Completely ignored and finished the transaction She looked up and I asked again and she said oh i already did it um and did not know what to do Asked the manager manager was not sure what to do either Im not even sure if they did the calculation right But on top of that the line got held up THE WORKERS LITERALLY WAITED FOR EVERYONE ELSE TO GET THEIR ORDERS THEN MADE OUR ORDERS It seemed like they were upset that we held up the line when it wasnt our fault at all WTF My brother was medically discharged from an accident being in the military Fuck yeah I want our discount Very bad service tbh The manager was the worst manager I had ever met UPDATE we were about to post our ice creams and guess what The manager gave us the cups with no Ghirardelli wordinglogos wow what a petty manager I hope hes new because he did not know how to be a manager at all,negative,251,250-300,1302,1000-1500
Wow I was not expecting for an ice cream shop to blow me out of the water I decided to give this place a try because Ive heard so many good things about their different ice cream flavors made in house First the service was fantastic They made sure the patio was spaced out so when people went up to get their order no one was stepping on each others toes The team Novel Ice Cream did a great job answering all my questions and allowed me to try a few flavors before I made my decision They also shared with me what was glutenfree on the menu including the little biscotti that comes with the smaller ice cream cups I know when I go back to Phoenix I am definitely coming here,positive,133,100-150,689,500-1000
Sausage and spinach Stromboli is simply perfect Make sure you get a side of sauce The sauce reminds me of my great grandfathers it is very classic and delicious The sfogliatelle is also amazing Eggplant parm chicken parm etc etc They get everything right here The only downside is the price and sometimes rude employees It seems like some of them feel like they know they have you coming back for the food so they dont even bother trying to be kind to you,positive,84,75-100,468,<500
The best donut ice cream sandwiches ever There waffle ice cream sandwiches were amazing as well My whole experience here from the moment I got in line to the moment I finished my food was spectacular Definitely worth the 49 minute drive and Ill definitely be back again,positive,48,25-50,274,<500
If there is a ZERO Star rating this is what this overrated place would have gotten In a smelly dumpy shopping center I thought I was in a Baskin n Robbins but that would have been cheaper and better I cant beleive all the sheep that go to this place Once was enough Nothing special nothing memorialexcept for the sign in the windowHiring fun enthusiastic scoopers I wanted to add to that signTo replace the unenthusiatic one that is currently working,negative,81,75-100,478,<500
It was close when we arrived at 11am but will probably visit earlier in October and give it a 45 star rating,negative,22,<50,117,<500
Its been a little over a month since they opened They only have two people in the cash register and they still have to bag the breads and some of the customers get 3 trays of bread so the lines take forever And then on some days the place closes at Midnight and yet they dont bake anymore bread at 10 pm,negative,62,50-75,310,<500
Yum Was afraid after reading some of the reviews but the macaroons were delish Had nice flavor and were great consistency Good price for the size We let ours get to room temperature as I saw they were refrigerated Also had the cheese danish which was a French croissant base with almost a cream cheese frosting It was a great texture soft inside crispy outside maybe a bit too much filling but still good We went right after they opened,positive,80,75-100,445,<500
We got a gift card to this place and I was super excited because I love cupcakes but I was so very disappointed  I got the red velvet since its my fav my it was totally disgusting the batter taste to much like egg and they leave weird after taste  The prices was pretty expensive it was 350 for one and 42 for a dozen totally not worth the price  My mom went again recentlyshe still had money on her gift card so I decided to try them again but still not so good didnt change my mind how I felt about them  Would def not go back ,negative,113,100-150,541,500-1000
I ordered a key lime tart and creme brulee and both tasted awful The key lime was overwhelmingly tart and the creme brulee was too hard The quality tasted like it was from an amature baker who was following a recipe online Not sure why so many people rave about this place Maybe thats all they have in the area,negative,60,50-75,316,<500
We went to Carlos bakery to buy some and they have a promo if you spend 20 or more you get a free cookie We spend around 25 and we showed them the promo on my phone and the salesperson called the supervisor and she ask a lot of question about where we got the promo and they need other proof so I said just forget about it Carlos bakery is so big that one cookie matters so much to them Carlos bakery was just overhype there product were not that good anyway Dont advertised a promo if you are not going to honor it Shame on Carlos bakery,negative,109,100-150,547,500-1000
The ice cream was amazing Went with friends and they had different flavors like the nerds and Cookie Monster which they said tasted amazing also The negative part of the whole thing was that there was a band outside playing music extremely loud But the ice cream place itself was amazing,positive,51,50-75,295,<500
Not bad ice cream Id go Tuesday night theres a good discount I got ice cream sundae with fudge give it a 4 when it comes to ice cream,negative,29,25-50,144,<500
Ok Sloans Ice Cream is super cute inside but way over priced for what you get It would be nice to bring your kids to see the store just be prepared to pay a lot for a little The prices dont seem bad but the portions are very small We purchased fudge and carrot cake ice cream The fudge was good but I probably would not go back,negative,68,50-75,336,<500
Cookies were NOT good Was so looking forward to trying this place that litters my Instagram adds and was so disappoint Maybe the cake is better but we tried every cookie flavor they had and they all tasted bad,negative,39,25-50,212,<500
Lets be honest ALL ice cream is GOOD ice creamI cant think of a time Ive ever had a bad scoop After reading all the reviews of this place I did have high hopes  assuming it would at least be as good as any store bought stuffbut presumably better I had my flavor picked out before I even got theredreaming of the salted carmel goodness gave me chills Once I got there I ended up trying a few different flavors because I didnt want to miss out on anything I tried the salted carmel which seemed okI thought maybe I just got a hold of a little tasting spoon that didnt have alot of salt or carmel in itdecided to get a scoop anyway assuming there would be alot more flavor once I really got into it I ordered a scoop of creamy coconut without trying it for my fiance And I also tried the almond brittle  which tasted very similar to the salted carmelsort of vanillay with a hint of carmel or something sweet and then some almonds Decided to get a scoop to go Also tried the honey lavendar which was a little too peculiar for me  tasted like a scoop of sweet pachouli Interestingnot my style After getting home with all my ice cream I let me mom and fiance try them No one seemed particularly impressedincluding myself Ive had better ice cream from the storeand evidently this is considered gelatowhich it is not Not by a long shot Ice cream or gelato this didnt make my top ten list After sitting in our fridge 3 tiny scoops for a few days  we only finished off the almond brittle and the others are still there I believe Ill end up throwing them out bc Id hate to waste the calories on it Ive NEVER thrown out ice cream before And I dont want to imply its terribleits just sub parnot very interesting even though the flavor combos would have you think so I wish I could give it a better review ,negative,349,300- 500,1894,1500-2000
I was extremely excited to visit this spot since the concept is cool  the flavors seem tasty  however the most anticlimatic experience of all time I arrived around 750 to a long wait but decided to stick it out because the long line must mean it has to be good right But after waiting in line for over an hour and being third in line around 910  it was announced that they were all out of ice cream and would only be serving bowls This experience was extremely offputting because how do you run out of an ingredient that is the premise of your business I likely wont return until they have settled in and are more prepared,negative,121,100-150,638,500-1000
For a place that says open until midnight i expected that the store would actually have a full line of products and someone to greet you upon arrival this was at 1030pm Ummmm that was not the case during my visit No one was there to even say hello and when looking at the flavors available there were only two to choose from chocolate and cucumber something One of my biggest pet peeves is an open store thats not really open might as well be closed right I went to this location with my wife with hopes to have my sweet tooth satisfied but was disappointed due to this experience I would give it one star but thats just not fair because I didnt even try their goodies Hopefully next time Ill have a better experience and arrive 5 hours before the stated closing time so I can actually see what their 4 star review is all about,negative,158,150-200,860,500-1000
Absolutely perfect donuts Owner was so kind and staff was so helpful We went everyday we were in Vegas Very cool establishment ,positive,23,<50,143,<500
We have a sprinkles in Dc and I am not impressed with their cupcakes but after the high roller ride my hubby had a sweet tooth The shop was packed but not cramped like in DC There were not many cupcake flavor options maybe 45 different ones My husband got the banana cupcake and thought it was good I got a vanilla with sprinkles and it wasnt good at all to me I am giving them a two because we had small talk with the employees and they were really friendly The shop was also clean and not cramped There are a few tables inside and outside for customers Sprinkles is located in a cool looking newly renovated alley area that takes you to other restaurants shops and the high roller Like I said Im not a fan of Sprinkles but maybe others enjoy their brand,negative,146,100-150,770,500-1000
I had a cookie sundae and it was nothing special I asked the associate to warm my cookie up but it was certainly not warm This sundae was simply a cookie broken up in a cup a scoop of ice cream on top of it then another cookie broken up on top I was disappointed but I guess this place is most famous for their cupcakes Maybe Ill try one next timemaybe,negative,72,50-75,365,<500
Every time I step inside Cosmopolitan I always gaze upon the delicious menu at Milk Bar This store hails from New York City and the cakes really are THAT GOOD While you may find a select few items at your local Target they have a much wider variety of cake pops ice cream and other delectable goods at this storefront We werent looking to gorge on the items so we simply left with a few cake pops with us If you happen to have an Identity account make sure to provide it so you can get points for your purchase I appreciate the fact that this place is also open relatively late so you can satisfy that late night craving 351002022,positive,121,100-150,647,500-1000
Excellent ice cream made in the Phoenix area Best chocolate Ive had in a long time Very friendly server who was more than happy to let all 5 of our group try any flavor ice cream we wanted Look forward to another visit of this delicious ice cream soon,positive,49,25-50,256,<500
Yep  Phenomenal Maple glazed Creme brulee  8 for 2 amazing donuts  Will definitely be back All the way from California Thanks guys,positive,25,<50,175,<500
Waste of money the only good thing going for them is the location which brings in tourists raises hand Like me First of all it was my first Kouign Amann 750 experience ever and omg It was as hard as a rock from the outer crisp caramelized layer to the inside of it which is suppose to be richbuttery and cake like Such a disappointment Also decided to try their macarons a vanilla and a pistachio 350ea Honestly the most expensive macarons Ive ever got and I wouldnt have minded the price if it was worth it Shell was sad and filling was overly sweet Overall mediocre macarons with a price tag that only Laduree should have Dont waste your time coming here Hopefully you read this review before you make another one like it,negative,135,100-150,751,500-1000
I havent had any of their sandwiches here just yet but the pastries are amazing Also the atmosphere is kinda a little on the hipstercoffee house side which usually can make a place feel a little too pretentious for my liking but I still find it comfortable there The staff is very helpful and Im looking forward to being able to make it by there for lunch sometime,positive,68,50-75,373,<500
Honestly I ordered the bday cake because the cashier said it was the most popular item on their menu Walmart bday cake tastes better Their cake was dry and the butter cream was extremely sweet Also ordered a cereal milk shake and threw that out after a sip Wasted 45 including tip I did it so you dont have to,negative,60,50-75,322,<500
Terrible experience Booked for a wedding reception Notified late that they could not do it Paid in advance Would NOT recommend,negative,21,<50,131,<500
Normally Im not a sweets kind of guy I like my salt and savory items HOWEVER Milk Bar is probably my absolutely guiltiest of all guilty pleasures so it makes sense that I stopped here multiple times while in Sin City Located in the Cosmo this little shop its the perfect place for a sweet treat after some time spent gambling or whatever you do while in Vegas Im not here to judge Lets first talk cookies compost corn and blueberry and cream cookies were what I tried The compost is that mix of sweet and salty Its got pretzels potato chips coffee oats graham cracker butterscotch and chocolate chips what more do you want guys The blueberry and cream has bits of milk crumbs and dried blueberries amazing And the corn is like this sweet buttery cornbread like cookie which I never knew I needed in my life They also have softserve and shakes guys and they are perfect The cereal milk softserve was my first swing They say its supposed to taste like the bottom of your cereal bowl which is the best thing ever right And they nail it on the head Milk cornflakes brown sugar and with a small amount of salt Oh em gee A perfect ten Theyve also got chocolate softserve and you can make this chocolate covered pretzel thing I mean you guys Its heaven Its amazing Its so sweet and lovely Ill be back Ill be back a lot more I cant wait to waste all of my calories on this because its worth every penny and calorie,positive,266,250-300,1469,1000-1500
The famous Churn ice cream They are attached to Windsor restaurant and a fun establishment They have old time toys and candies to browse through while you wait for your ice cream We went right after they opened so we had to wait about 15 minutes for them to put out all the ice cream but the employee engaged us and looking through the toys killed the time I had the pineapple sorbet in a cake cone and my boyfriend had the Vietnamese coffee The Vietnamese coffee was very sweet and uses real coffee ground Delicious It was perfectly creamy and just like drinking a cup of Vietnamese coffee The pineapple sorbet was very refreshing and crumbly Delicious The reason I took a star away was lack of preparation before opening and the only bad thing stale cone My cake cone was so stale that I took 2 bites of it and threw it away Yuck Being socked in the sorbet didnt help at all Ill be back but next time Ill just get it in the cup,positive,178,150-200,949,500-1000
This place is a must see We got to freemont looking for some caffiene and ran into this awesome place We had the Creme Brulee and Twix donuts and they were amazing The staff was super nice and our coffee hit the spot There little barlike seating and a cool fish tank with copies of real donuts in there Definitely making this stop every visit to Vegas,positive,67,50-75,358,<500

INTRO A unique Asian cafe that specializes in matcha desserts Matcha Cafe Maiko is prepared to bring some matcha into your life I can guarantee that this special experience will make you say I love matcha so matcha after finishing your first dessert I normally get their matcha soft serve but you also cant go wrong with their other desserts and drinks on their menu DESSERT 1 Golden Shogun 950  This is the ultimate flex move A softserve flavor of your choice matcha hojicha seasonal topped off with a 24k edible gold sheet in a waffle cone will make you feel like a millionaire The matcha flavor is present but its definitely not one of the strongest Ive tasted Ive made stronger matcha milkshakes at home WORTH IT YES its worth it for the experience and whenever youre in town Overall 710,positive,143,100-150,827,500-1000
Im a huge fan of Cake boss I seen the bakery and had to stop the line was insane but I stood in line anyway I ordered the mini strawberry cheesecake with the crumbs for about 11 bucks Im sad to say that your better off going to the Cheesecake Factory The cheesecake was bland the strawberry on top was the best ever,negative,63,50-75,325,<500
Oh Melt how I love thee Let me count the ways I love you Fruity Pebbles the Nutella and Vietnamese Coffee the Green Tea and the Strawberry Banana sorbet Was truly a flight of fancy for my taste buds I love the one of a kind shop itself And the service was outstanding Btw the sample of Cucumber sorbet was perfect to round out this treat of a night,positive,69,50-75,361,<500
After all the hype around this place I left sorely disappointed For one this place is so expensive for what you get which I would not have minded if the food was good I ordered the famous cereal milk soft serve with cereal topping I dont even know how to properly explain the taste It didnt taste like cereal milk I was expecting it to be rich and sweet in flavor like how cereal milk usually is However the soft serve was so bland and underwhelming in flavor I tried hard while eating it to convince myself that it tasted okay but I couldnt finish it I also had the birthday cake truffles They tasted better than the soft serve but were a little too sweet and a little dry Cant really explain it but the texture was weirdly sandy Milk Bar has so much potential I really like the aesthetics of this place The concept is very cute and trendy but their product is lacking,negative,166,150-200,896,500-1000
This is a place to get ice cream and enjoy a night out with the family Ice cream was good but I found it very offensive and certainly inappropriate that they posted a political sign saying Fk Trump on their register Freedom of speech is fine but NOT vulgar language at a family ice cream place,negative,56,50-75,299,<500
I was stopping over at Vegas for a day and found out Buddy has a store here So wanted to check it out Had the cannoli and lobster tails they were both made to perfectionlove it However the service is just ok a bit slow now I understand why the lines are so long,positive,54,50-75,277,<500
I came here one day because the bakery was closed There was a line almost out of the door so I figured I couldnt go wrong I ordered two of the yummy buns which is a warm glazed donut with ice cream in between with addins I tried one with vanilla ice cream with cinnamon toast crunch cereal and the salted caramel brownie Honestly it didnt knock my socks off The donut was amazing but other than that nothing I actually ate the ice cream without the donut and found it had zero flavor which is why it simply wasnt worth it I dont understand how you can serve ice cream without flavor Seriously if the ice cream had flavor this place would be a staple for me right after I leave the gym Lol,negative,135,100-150,710,500-1000
My daughter loved her shake so much We loved the old school look of the inside The staff was friendly and courteous The only thing I could complain about is the line on a hot day but thats nitpicking I would recommend to everyone,positive,44,25-50,236,<500
With Blue Bell off the shelf Sweet Republic is a good fallback for creamy rich ice cream The more you care about the quality of ice cream the more you will like this place They dont have an outrageous selection of flavors and have only a few toppings but I would scream for this ice cream,positive,56,50-75,294,<500
I used to go to the Warrensville VanAken location but the attitude of the young white male that works there is DEPLORABLE The last time I went was early February and he was a text book RACIST at heart He was extremely friendly and professional to the white family in front of me which made me feel that are experience was going to be just as friendly and professional Nope When I walked up to the counter he didnt say hi welcome to Mitchells How can I help you He just stared at me I stared back He finally said what can I get for you I placed my order and when it was time to pay for it he didnt take my money until I sat it on the counter and he placed my change on the counter Im done with this RACIST location I now patronize the BEACHWOOD location They very friendly professional and its worth the drive,negative,160,150-200,835,500-1000
Okay I had heard and read about this place since moving to this side of town and finally came Big waste of time and gas They Do Not have ice cream only soft serve Well I ordered butter pecan ice cream and what do they bring me Vanilla Wow are their servers just lazy or dumb,negative,56,50-75,283,<500
Despite their awful business practices and allegedly poor treatment of their workers they make excellent pastries and coffee They are also a 24 hour joint Thats really all you can ask for in a town with few other allnight eateries I get so bogged on just the pastries and coffee I havent even tried their sandwiches which are probably also great My only complaint is the people Im a pretty antisocial person and not a hipster so everyone in the alwayslongestlineever line really bugs me Just a personal thing but it still doesnt stop me from going so theres another testament to how good this place is,positive,107,100-150,620,500-1000

Ive been to a few of Ghirardelli Ice Cream shops San Diego both locations in Chicagomy fiancÃ and I even deemed it our favorite ice cream We were ecstatic they opened one in Vegas so we definitely had to go get our usual order Located on towards the end of the Linq Promenade be sure to take note of the hours of operation they have a hard stopif it closes at 1200am you better believe they close at 1200am while we were inside we saw them turn away at least 15 customers Maybe this location should think about closing at 2am instead My fiancÃ and I ordered are usual and its very basic vanilla ice cream with dark chocolate fudge Although the same price we were SHOCKED to find out the the portion is MUCH smaller than what we had in San Diego  Chicago I mean I shouldnt be surprised because its Vegas but I would rather pay Vegas pricing rather than skimping on portion size It was very disappointing Aside from that the ice cream and fudge were decentbut by then our experience was let down by the small portion size compared to the other locations weve been to,negative,201,200-250,1101,1000-1500
Ice cream is delicious and the aesthetic of the shop is adorable Perfect place for dessert after dinner or just a nice spot to hang out and catch up with friends The only thing is that I wish they had more flavors,positive,42,25-50,216,<500
If I could give them a score of zero to a negative star I would My family and I love to watch cake boss Its a great show So when we heard that there was a cake boss bakery opening up in Las Vegas We decided to try it out I called ahead looking for a cake that would be big enough to feed 1012 people I hoped to get the cake for my mothers birthday When I called they told me that they had some cakes big enough to feed 1012 people The girl on the phone told me they had several cakes available I paid for it over the phone When I got there to pick up the cake I was livid The cake I paid for was over 60 but thats what I expected coming from Las Vegas Cake Boss But the cake they were trying to say I paid for was smaller than my hand Enough to feed 4 people So the girl takes the cake to the side where another lady looks to be prepping dough for cookies They talk for about 15 minutes The girl comes back and tells me I have two options one that I can get cup cakes to put around the cake But I have to pay 450 for each additional cupcake She then tells me my second option is to cut the cake into thin pencil like slices Seriously I told her I wanted the cake I ordered over the phone and paid for She then opens her cash drawer and tells me heres your money back Thats customer service I am beyond frustrated Will never be purchasing anything from this place I highly suggest that you all try some of the better bakery shops on and off the Strip Like Rolling in the Dough Great service and even better desserts,negative,312,300- 500,1557,1500-2000
Meh Ive experienced better Was exactly my reaction Ive been to other locations and for some reason the macarons here tasted stale and the coffee was bleh The macarons were a bit harder than Im used to at their other locations but still kept their iconic large size I usually order the caramel and the chocolate covered chocolate,negative,58,50-75,340,<500
A stingy cashier with a really bad attitude She shoved my fifteen items into one small box and refused to give me another one Also gave me a small bag which couldnt fit my box so I could imagine buying a cake there If youre planning to go to 85 degrees I definitely recommend another location,negative,56,50-75,302,<500
So I was meeting with a client who directed me to this location From first glance I love the sentiment behind the love lock But then I went inside to order before my meeting so I walked in with 2 people in front of me Before I knew it I had been standing there for 10 minutes when a cashier says Ill take the next person in line When I start to approach she says no maam those people were in front of you She then proceeds to tell me where the line starts which is NOT clearly posted at the entrance Should care less how long I had waited Looking astonished I just found the nearest exit and left So I cant speak on the food but customer service was down right rude uninviting and callus Will not be returning,negative,141,100-150,730,500-1000

Part of my favorite morning routine before I stepped out of the Venetian to hit the Strip was to stop at this small bakery outside the hotel and nibble on their delectable goodies Their huge slidersized macarons caught my eye when I first walked past and I knew immediately I had to come give them a try Oh and these babies The Queen bees of macarons as their gargantuan bodies stood out amongst the vast array of smaller more delicate confectioneries and other irresistible French baked goods on display I purchased their Pistachio Vanilla and Chocolate macarons and not surprisingly Pistachio was my favorite  Ive been completely smitten ever since Quite possibly the best Pistachio macarons Ive ever had The cookie shell was perfectly crisp yet easily giving way to the pillowy soft goodness within as you take bite after delicate bite  sigh Heaven The prices were great too at 350each I also tried their croissant which wasnt bad as it was buttery and flaky Honestly though I just wish Thomas Keller can open a Bouchon Bakery closer to where I live as I now have a new potentially lifelong obsession with their Queensized macarons,positive,197,150-200,1164,1000-1500

Ice cream here had always been amazing Vegan flavors are all worth a try Always appreciated them offering good non dairy alternatives Most people know how good their ice cream isbut a new discovery and the point of this review is how downright amazing their ice cream cakes are Ive only had the black raspberry chocolate one but have heard others say all the flavors are equally as good and also hearing you can make custom orders The ice cream cake is unlike any other Ive had The cake portion is dense not what I expected at all more like a brownie bite that comes in ice cream The frosting is fantastic The proportion of cake it ice cream is perfect Def would recommend everyone try They usually always have them in the display case for a last minute pick up,positive,141,100-150,778,500-1000

My Wife and Kids are fans of Cake Boss My wife had to stop here and grab some pastries to feel part of the experience We sat in a not so long line that just took forever 1 hour minimum The shop located inside the Venetian casino sells several pastries running anywhere from 4  15 you can also purchase smaller pastries by the pound The shop is nicely decorated you can see people preparing items from the window while you stand in line There is a worker controlling the flow of the line at times she brought out samples to calm people while they wait This was a nice touch There are not a lot of choices once you get to the counter My wife ordered the lobster tail canolli pecan chocalate covered cookie velvet cupcake and some cookies that you could purchase per pound The lobster tail was good not great not worth the wait pecan cookie had better the canolli was very good enjoyed the custard the rest of the items were meh I forget the pricing but I know it was expensive for what we received I did not finish the pecan cookie the lobster tail was ok but that also was not completely devoured The only thing we finished was the canolli I would not be back Ive been to much better bake shops back home Extraordinary desserts Somecrust Bakery to name a few,negative,239,200-250,1284,1000-1500
You just cannot beat a good cupcake Ive been to Sprinkles in NYC previously so I knew what I was walking into when we found this spot on the strip What a fabulous little store front I wish they all looked like this Service was quick and curteous Instead of just a regular red velvet I opted for the sundae and was not disappointed The ice cream was incredible honestly wasnt expecting it to be that great Vanilla really balanced nicely with the red velvet This however was dinner I wouldnt recommend going if you already ate its quite filling and after eating that youll be feeling like the ultimate fattie Be sure to take a nice long stroll down the strip when you finish ,positive,126,100-150,694,500-1000
Had to make a trip to come here because I love the show It was quite hard to find and really small Long line but the price wasnt as bad as I thought it was going to be It was a great place to stop by once because of the novelty,positive,51,50-75,233,<500
Pastries that you make googley eyes at with your mouth open and Stromboli in three or four recipes Just awesome and a great selection of Italian pasta dishes ready to eat at great prices Im from Wichita KS but this place is so good its worth a trip to Cleveland just to eat here its a great casual dining experience in the heart of little Italy in Cleveland OH,positive,69,50-75,365,<500
My sister and I were in Vegas last weekend I have to be honest and say this place was a let down Id read many reviews and looked over a lot of pics and got excited to try something sweet The treats we bought did not live up to the expectations We each got a macaron and croissant The macaron tasted like it was stale Like the taste something gets when its left in the fridge for too long and is an absorbent type food I got the apple croissant and thought it was way too dry My sister had the chocolate croissant and thought the same thing It was kind of a pain to get to so this is a spot Ill not waste time on next time Im in town,negative,132,100-150,648,500-1000
Shall we Dance  Theres a huge difference between selflove and pity So if you ARE going to spend Valentines Day by yourself eating ice cream directly from a pint  you might as well make those calories count with great ice cream In which case you cant go wrong picking Sweet Republic consistently on the best ice cream shops across America lists as your dance partner Theres an art to selecting your partner in tango You cant simply send a cheap You up text message Thats a different game In Argentina the process is called Cabeceo Spanish for head again your mind gutter Keep out of Respecting tradition I followed the proper process on Valentines Day First I surveyed my available options Gingerbread hmm a flavor I usually love but this one lacks boldness Apple pie better but mainly due to Caskwerks Distilling Apple Pie liqueur than chunks of pie Pumpkin Spice Nice cinnamon ginger nutmeg allspice cardamom cloves Huckleberry Swirl Great wild mountain berries from Oregon But the day demanded something extra special and so my attention turned to the Coconut Cashew Curry But before I made flirtatious eye contact I quickly pondered whether my attraction was prompted simply by the exotic flavors that have been tempting me lately Earl Grey Sriracha Everything bagel So was it just the charm of something very different from what Im used to Or does the flavor itself have substantive merit No other way to find out than a quick whirl Ahh like a sultry siren theres a mystique and depth to the Coconut Cashew Curry The curry felt more Japanese than Indian Theres enough cashew mixed in to unveil a sweet but nutty profile The heat builds up slowly but doesnt burst into flames in your throat Leading to a complex sweetheat finale thats both satisfying and yet leaves you gasping for more More More ice cream Every addict should consider whether heshe is spiraling downward to a situation where one needs a stronger dose just to get the same satisfaction Well aware of my ice cream addiction and preference for complexity I decided to mix things up going with a flavor I havent had in years but highly recommended by coowner Helen Yung Brown Butter Pecan Personally the desserts I like best are the ones that make me both feel AND think And they usually remind me of a pleasurable moment from the past That Proust guy was on to something But poor guy only had Madeleines to tempt him In my case the Brown Butter ice cream reminded me of my favorite Indian dessert Ras Malai milk corn flour sugar saffron pistachio  which is the highest compliment I can give Sweet Republic given my impossibly high standards for the Indian dessert there was a year when I tried Ras Malai at 100 different shops and restaurants in NYC But the association was prompted by the elements milk cream sugar nuts pecan in this case and mostly the texture To me a great Ras Malai straddles the borders of solid and liquid states of nature and just surrenders completely to the tongue upon contact Similarly I think the best ice cream is also one which is slowly melting and doesnt have to be coaxed to become one with your soul Completely enraptured by the ice cream the tango morphed over time to the meditative abandonment of the ego in the Semazen  performed by the whirling dervishes So what I mean to say is Yes I got completely carried away and ate more than half a pint of the Brown Butter Pecan But dessert should never make you feel bad Even if one gives of oneself completely on a first date For you can always walk away your guilt later  and be thankful that its no walk of shame  Sharu wi Dansu Japanese 1996  not the pathetic 2004 remake with Richard Gere and JLo,positive,658,500+,3843,2000+

I was looking forward to trying this bakery for a very long time The sweets created by Buddy and his crew on their television show have always made my mouth water What I found out here was that these two items cost 22 and were just as flavorful as ones I could have grabbed at Whole Foods or the grocery store They were decent but not 22 worthy,negative,68,50-75,351,<500
Definitely did not live up to the hype We got the Cereal Milk Latte Compost Cookie and Milk Bar Pie The Compost Cookie came wrapped in plastic and tasted much like any other prepackaged cookie Nothing special there The Milk Bar Pie was sweet on sweet but didnt really have a ton of depth of flavor Ive made better pie at home Once again nothing special Ultimately the only really interesting thing was the Cereal Milk Latte It did genuinely have the flavor of milk after youve finished eating cereal For the price Id honestly rather take the time to bake something at home Based on my experience youre simply paying for the name Ive had better pies and cookies for much less,negative,123,100-150,700,500-1000

Bless Batch Their baguettes are the best in town with options for baguette and demi baguette depending on how hungry you are Everything from cookies to croissants are absolutely delicious and high quality I gravitate mostly towards the sweets but the savory items like the quiche are and croissants are a good size for having one savory item and one sweet The savory pastries such as chorizocheese bread and gruyere croissants are a little messy but honestly such is the nature of anything with these types of cheeses Single serve monkey bread is an awesome ideasometimes you just dont want to break out the Bundt pan but here they are in single servings Seating is mostly on stools facing the window and you can also purchase coffee or bottled beverages Batch is my 1 recommended bakery in town for nearly anything,positive,141,100-150,834,500-1000

As good as the Bouchon Bakery locations in Yountville and New York City Conveniently located right outside the guest elevators in the Venetian It was easy to pop downstairs and grab some pastries and coffee and take them back upstairs for breakfast  cheaper and tastier than room service Had the cheese danish croissant yogurt parfait an almond brioche a strawberry croissant and a raspberry macaron Everything was delicious Bouchon macarons are probably the best Ive had in the US The service was a little on the snotty side but Ive actually found that to be the case at the other two Bouchon Bakery locations too Weird,positive,107,100-150,637,500-1000

Dear Readers It was a slightly breezy night during COVID19 Our group stood in line outside Churn at a safe distance for less than 10 min as they were letting in one group at a time The staff was very friendly and knowledgeable about their products More importantly they were all wearing masks The flavors were unique and intriguing but we settled on mint chip ice cream  mint chip cookie and goat cheese pistachio topped with strawberries per the recommend of the masked associate The flavors were fresh and authentic We sat in the back patio with friends and enjoyed the night Sincerely Hillary and Andrew,positive,107,100-150,622,500-1000

Had the worst experience here on a Monday afternoon My two friends and I walk in and we were the ONLY people by the registersdessert bar waiting to order desserts The kid who with the brown hair and glasses that worked there kept calling out numbers apparently youre suppose to grab a ticket when you walk in which Happens to be on the side where people exit and they serve you according to your ticket number because we live in the god damn 50s My friends and I stood there for about 10 minutes when we finally ask if we can order desserts The kid working there then scolds us about how we can only be served if we grab a ticket I then replied that we will grab a ticket and the employee says I will serve you this time BUT NEXT TIME Grab a ticket well guess what asshole there wont be a next time How about you serve your guests who are clearly not familiar with your stupid ticket service and kindly explain to them how your system works rather than making them feel like a moron As our horrible experience continues my friend orders about 45 delicious looking desserts The employee then decides to make the rudest comment to her you know that saying Dont go grocery shopping if youre hungry no sir we do not know that saying please elaborate where your are going with this statement Sorry for ordering desserts and supplying you with a paycheck maybe next time we will order one single cookie so you can make 234 an hour As my friend was being served by this four eyed ass hat I was patiently waiting to be served also I look over at the other employee who continues to flip his ticket numbers and shouting out numbers We were still the only people at the dessert bar seriously Clearly this employee was also a moron Finally the first employee finishes helping my friend and I ask him what his favorite dessert is He replies Well I dont eat junk food    Is this a fucking joke You work in the restaurant industry clearly at a place that serves desserts and your response is that you dont eat junk food Are you calling your employers delicious desserts junk Nice I did not know how to respond to this peasants comment so I continued to order what I thought looked good I then ask him how they serve the biscotti cookies and he replies we sell them by the pound I then asked if I could get a half pound of biscotti cookies and he looks at me and asks well how many do you want I then said I want a half pound and he says yeah but how many do you want I thought to myself Are you fucking with me child I will take four cookies I responded They had two different cookies and I asked if the sign referred to the bottom ones  the sign said cinnamon and the worker responds um yeah S is for cinnamon um okay Finally he rang me out and I tipped him Im not sure why honestly Probably because he was towering over me as I was signing my receipt I would have rather donated my money to starving homeless people in Cleveland Worst customer service I have EVER experienced and we will never go back Very sad considering the desserts were amazing,negative,583,500+,3165,2000+
We were so excited to try this bakery Unfortunately we were disappointed The line was long We had to take a number and waited about half hour to purchase our sweets We bought a few cupcakes and a few cannolis The cannolis were ok but nothing memorable The cupcakes were dry and tasted old I doubt they were baked the day we bought them Save your money If you want delicious cupcakes go to Sprinkles in the Linq,negative,78,75-100,422,<500
The Best The End Kidding Yelp makes me say more in order for the review to be recommended First you get to try any and all flavors you want They dont want to feeling guilty to keep asking for tastes and do a great job of encouraging it They only do small batch ice cream so the flavors are constantly rotating I wont say every ice cream was my cup of tea but thats just fine since they let me taste until I find perfection Price point is very fair and the portion size is perfect its small enough that you dont feel like a glutton and big enough to be fully satisfied Ive been here three times now I went for my first time on a Friday night and loved it so much I had to take my roommate the very next day Ill keep on coming back Service price flavor ambience every part of this place is five stars,positive,161,150-200,836,500-1000

I was at the market with my family and had admittedly very stupidly boasted about this place without ever trying it based solely on the reviews We wont ever try De Luxe again or recommend friends here The man behind the counter belongs at a bar not a crepe stand He was rude very unfriendly and unhelpful You would think he could direct some traffic or tell us where to stand as there is no organization whatsoever  with the coffee stand right next door the merging threepronged lines facing every direction and costumers asking Im sorry youre in line For coffee or crepes I didnt realize there was a difference He doesnt even look up to register customers as they stop by and barely acknowledges your order with a grunt Doesnt thank you for your business Doesnt tell you how long its going to be Doesnt answer questions without an annoyed tilt in his voice How do people keep coming back In addition he has one burly hand ungloved to accept dirty cash then quickly swats his fingers together with alcohol to sanitize Before medical school I worked in the food service industry  and I can tell you with experience from BOTH places that this is not an effective sanitation method if youre dealing with filthy cash and fresh fruit Poor questionable service aside I was excited for the crepes and Im forced to pose the question what is all this fuss There is nothing exciting or experimental about the menu De Luxe serves runofthemill nutella  banana variations Our bananas were not ripe despite the stands literal twominute distance from fresh fruit at the market next door The batter once cooked reeked of eggs Ive had better MUCH much better both in terms of service and product Maybe the guy was off his game Maybe I just have higher standards for a simple dish Maybe I shouldnt be comparing New York or Beirut to Cleveland Frankly if this place wasnt in Cleveland  where it is the only place to get good crepes within a fifteen mile radius  I doubt itd still be in business Never again,negative,361,300- 500,2077,2000+

I love Dripps they have great customer service The staff is friendly and helpful The ice cream is amazing the cereal is not soggy at all,positive,26,25-50,141,<500
Seriously not that great You wain like half hour in line and then you feel rushed The floor is dirty and the customer service is ok The only thing we came back for are the lobster rolls  595 each Other than that none of the bread is worth the calories Just selling the name at a crazy price,negative,59,50-75,300,<500
The cookies travelled for 3 hours in a car and they were still good I dont know if the cookiesdesserts are worth the cost but they did taste good Its a nice treat to have once in a while since theyre very sugary I cant add anything more helpful about the cookies or the place that other yelpers have not written about yet but that the cookies do hold up well even in a warm car I wasnt greeted with a melted chocolate chip cookie but a sturdy cookie filled with soft chocolate chips,positive,94,75-100,495,<500
Homemade donuts at their finest The icing is amazing Each one is a work of art Once you try Jack Frost you can never go back to box store donuts again,positive,31,25-50,155,<500
Batch bakehouse has so many wonderful pastry and other baked good options I got the almond chocolate croissant which was so delicious The almond icing on the top makes it a much sweeter pastry but I am generally never one to say no to more sugar so it worked for me And the almond chocolate croissant was the same price as the regular chocolate one 325 Overall the croissant was a great mix of flaky on the outside and soft on the inside yum The bakery is in an adorable area has friendly staff and nice bright lighting A great place to stop in for a treat or meet a friend to enjoy some delicious Madison sweets,positive,117,100-150,636,500-1000
Ive gotten ice cream from this location in the past and the ice cream was delicious Unfortunately on my last trip which was a couple of days ago we were very disappointed with our purchase The ice cream tasted like baking soda We got multiple flavors and we had to toss it YUK,negative,53,50-75,281,<500
Stood in line Seemed like a popular place The pastries looked good Got to the front and learned there was no coffee because the worker was too busy to make any It was 830AM I may be a tough reviewer but I think a coffee shop should probably figure out how to have coffee at 830AM So the coffee and pastries may be great  I dont know because they didnt have any,negative,73,50-75,374,<500
Eh whatever ice cream Even accepting the flavors given they were just  fine I guess Choices were kind of limited and a bit bizarre there were like 3 coffee things a dozen sorbets but no vanillla or chocolate nothing even containing chocolate,negative,43,25-50,251,<500
Sooo I love icecream But dripps has put two of my most favorite things together so I can enjoy cereal and soft serve So creamy and crunchy Glad they brought this icecream that is a must try Friendly knowledgeable staff Definitely worth the wait Have already gone 3 times in a week,positive,52,50-75,288,<500
the store is filled with a lot of nothing i got oreo boba there and it was straight ass It tastes like oreos in water with hints of PEANUT BUTTER and milk the tapioca boba texture was like a ball that was hella tore up i wouldnt recommend getting boba there and there wasnt boba pricing ANYWHERE additionally my girl got a double scoop 8oz of ice cream in a plastic cup it was about 7 dollars the portion is unrealistically small i would just get a pint of ice cream from a store,negative,94,75-100,491,<500
I went to this place based on the reviews that Im seeing of 4 and 5 stars Let me start with the good The ice cream is good quality in somewhat interesting flavors I chose cookies and cream and macadamia chocolate I think but they also have Nutella and others I got a cookie cup with 2 scoops and marshmallow The macaroon ice cream and torch fired marshmallow blended to make a really good flavor and based on that alone I could recommend this place Because of what they charge for extremely small scoops of ice cream a small cookie and a bit of marshmallow 1021 I couldnt help but feel completely ripped off When I say the serving I got was small I mean 5 bites from a dixie cup small I walked out of there wishing Id driven to Sweet Republic or tried a different place,negative,148,100-150,795,500-1000
My wife and I love Sweet Republic Its a must try for our out of town guests I stop by frequently and get pints on my way home from work So many flavors such variety I also work in food service and am picky about health codes cant help it and Ive never had any problems with SR Side note Too many people on here complaining about the prices If youre willing to spend 5 on coffee but not on the best ice cream in town there is something wrong with you,positive,92,75-100,467,<500
The cupcakes look good in the shop but we will see what it looks like when we get home Most places automatically put the cupcakes in a box if they are taken to go not Sprinkles The girl behind the counter asked if this was for here or to go and then proceeded to just place the cupcake in a paper bag I asked about a box like most cupcake places generally just automatically do and was told that was an additional 50 centswhatwell I guess we will just see how this already expensive cupcake looks after traveling down the strip to get home,negative,104,100-150,552,500-1000
So friendly Bomb ass tapioca boba  drinks and always super clean My family loves this spot,positive,17,<50,96,<500
I LOVE Fatty Daddys It is sort of hard to find but we discovered it because we live right down the street and its within walking distance dangerous but we make ourselves walk or bike there to burn the extra calories HA I cant eat gluten and theyre always really careful and cautious about that Their cookie cup with a macaroon and marshmallow is SO good My husband always tells me that I dont need the big one because Ill never finish it but I cant go the macaroon and marshmallow The ice cream is really creamy my personal fav I dont like ice flakes in my cream and the flavors are great Salted Caramel is my goto and once I find something I like I stick with it My husband likes the coffee flavor but he mixes it up each time and says theyre all equally as delicious Definitely support this cute local business,positive,155,150-200,845,500-1000
I cant imagine theres much that will draw a 20 minute line out the door in Phoenix on an otherwise random Thursday night but Churn is most certainly capable of doing that  and its because theyve got it all Star 1 How were the service and atmosphere While the line can grow long its tough to beat the service and atmosphere once youre in the door at Churn The staff couldnt be more friendly or helpful and theres enough in here to look at from classic sodas and candy to ice cream for the line time to pass quickly Star Star 2 How were the portions relative to the cost With all this dessert glitz and glam comes a relatively hefty price tag and I did cringe just a little bit after handing over a whopping 750 for a Smores sundae The price points are right on the edge of reasonable here but at the end of the day its worth it Star Stars 3 and 4 How was the food My Smores sundae was both good and unique but its the toasted marshmallow here that youre really paying for Besides that this was simply a cup full of vanilla ice cream graham crackers and chocolate fudge which while good didnt really taste like smores on account of there only being a small single side of toasted marshmallow Single Star Star 5 Would you eat here every day if you could Its really hard to say that Churn is anything but a dessert mecca Star,positive,256,250-300,1371,1000-1500
Wont be going back to sweet republic ever again Dont get be wrong the ice cream is delicious I arrived at 1150am not realizing they dont open until noon That certainly isnt their fault However it is 104 degrees outside and I had my 3 month old baby with me One of the employees came to the door at 1155am and opened it I was so relieved they were going to let me in out of the heat However he wasnt opening the door for me he was leaving Shut the door and locked it as he said sorry and walked away I can take my 8 elsewhere,negative,108,100-150,546,500-1000
The ice cream was the best ice cream I have ever eaten in my entire life I ordered a scoop of capn crunch with graham cracker on top Literally one of the greatest things I have ever put into my mouth The people working in the store were so sweet and recommended the graham cracker which was a great idea I also ordered a chocolate marshmallow cupcake That was probably not the best choice I could have gotten The frosting was a ganache on top almost like a fondant and I like creamy soft frosting so I would have enjoyed the coconut or red velvet one more probably The ATM was so cute and the atmosphere inside the store was adorable and very clean Loved every part of the visit,positive,130,100-150,697,500-1000
I have given this place ample tries Three times they have turned me away because they will NOT put cookies from one counter on the same transaction as cupcakes from another counter when paying with a credit card Instead of offering to simply hand the cookies to the cupcake counter  or vice versathey offer to sell you ice cream instead Makes me wonder why they didnt name place Stuck on Shrooms  but your icing is pretty decenthence thee star ,negative,82,75-100,489,<500
Whenever I come to Vegas ESPECIALLY with friends who have no experienced these cupcakes before I make sure to stop by this store One of my favorite desserts in Vegas Plus the Cupcake ATM is always an interesting show to anyone 1010 would go to again,positive,46,25-50,255,<500
I came here a few weeks ago on national ice cream day I had pretty high hopes for this place after having read the review and it did not disappoint Ive been back many times since but every time whatever flavor I get is always delicious Cold creamy and hits the right spot,positive,53,50-75,281,<500
So this is our last day in Vegas and we decided to bring my sister herethis being my second time here I have to say I wouldnt order strawberries as for the chocolate dipped strawberries were made the day before and you could see the strawberries sweating and the strawberries soft I asked if they had new one yes typical me I want fresh she goes and ask the back comes back says no and laughs while talking to another employee Will I return maybe And thats a big maybe,negative,90,75-100,474,<500
Ill start by saying that I practically worship Christina Tosi Im a classically trained pastry chef and have always looked forward to trying her product The actual sweets themselves were fine but the prices were outrageous I would have loved for the cookies to have been fresh but they were prepackaged and the compost cookie I so looked forward to tasted very stale Disappointed,negative,64,50-75,387,<500
Im so upset with this baking store Were got here at 850pm and the door was locked but still had some employees in the store And the guy saw me knocking the door and ask him did they close he was just pretending not seeing me I can understand that if closing at 900pm and lock the door whatever you want tobut at least you need to have somebody to answer me that youre closedright First time been this bakery store but never ever again,negative,85,75-100,449,<500
From a distant land of NY I come to this establishment all for tiramisu As I approach the delectable sweets I ask for my prize and yet nothing is delivered I am told this is a fwench bakewy and the most desired dessert is not within the walls of this cluttered palace of Knick knacks and oddly positioned tables My head hangs dejectedly My life is at a standstill I must return to my land of NY tomorrow without a whisper of that layered dessert my heart yearns for All because this is a fwench bakewy,negative,96,75-100,518,500-1000
Love this place  Love the cake bread Drink  Especially the cake Tastes so good,positive,16,<50,85,<500
My buddy and I came here one afternoon to get some ice cream I got 3 scoops in a waffle bowl I got a scoop of salted butter caramel a scoop of almond butter crunch and a scoop of peanut butter chip This ice cream has the same texture of Breyers More icy than creamy It was freaking delicious though and all 3 flavors were unique in their own way It was 625 I believe after the waffle bowl was thrown in there It was tasty My buddy tried the sweet corn ice cream I had a taste of it and it was surprisingly good He also picked up a bag of bacon brittle It was just okI thought it would be like crunchy toffee with bacon in it It was soft like caramel almost with bacon in it Overall it was a good stop and their ice cream flavors are a little crazy but they all work out somehow,positive,160,150-200,798,500-1000
There desserts were ok The man kept on messing up our order and there service was horrible The lady yelled when I asked her not to double bag the banana bread bc they were for two different family She also said there are too many kids here and too much noise then they tried to force us to take peppermint mocha for my daughter instead of hot chocolate I just gave up wow Didnt realize bakery does not like the kids when they were the reason we came If you wanted to get verbally abused while you pay for it then go there otherwise dont,negative,105,100-150,549,500-1000
Try the banana ice cream Its the best Everyone is friendly The place is too small to handle the crowds but the ice cream is well worth it Dont raise your prices,positive,32,25-50,167,<500
Too sweet and sugary for my liking but this is definitely a cute place for families and kids to go to There are lots of options I would definitely recommend going here though if you have a sweet tooth,negative,39,25-50,204,<500
Having a crappy day at work Go here for lunch get a sundae your life will be better The BEST thing is the caramel sauce They covered my ice cream with it thanks for not being stingy with the sauce I asked to try the cheese ice cream and the lady gave me a tiny speck on a tiny spoon Is it rude to ask for a bigger sample Especially after I patiently waited while she was on the phone for 5 minutes and ignored me Oh well My only complaint is 2 scoops wasnt enough I think Id need at least a 3 scoop sundae And Im little A 3scooper would probably run around 1000 That seems extravagant for ice cream even in Scottsdale Parking sucks at lunchtime However if I wanted to become obese I think Id get a biggie fry from McDs across the street then come here for a 3scooper Every day And a side of their bacon brittle,positive,163,150-200,845,500-1000
This is for the location by the escalatorto go only Shame on VenetianThomas Keller to hire such rude people We waited in line and the place one orders is before you get to the other food showcase around the corner My wife and I told the employee that asked for order to hand on we want to see the 2nd case When we came back around to order she RUDELY and obnoxiously told us not to cut into line and go back to the end f the line Thankfully the couple behind said we were ahead of them and to let us order We put in our order and received our order less an ice brew coffee I simply asked were were missing a coffee and again we were rudely told they are out of coffee and making some more and to be patient Could there not be a better way of saying that RUINED the entire experience to have a coffee and pastry,negative,164,150-200,828,500-1000
I dont know much about the show but Im sure the guy is great and successful My Aunt has been to the original bakery since the 90s and has said good things This place needs to get their act together There is one line to wait on to pick out what you would like When you get up to the counter and someone helps you there are no descriptions no prices for 90 of the items I know this is going to be expensive because its on the strip so I go ahead and get some things  black and white cookies canoli cream puffs chocolate chip cookies and a 3layer cookie  which is my favorite and a holiday tradition for me I was very excited for this 3 layer cookie to compare it to my own The employee puts everything on a tray asks my name and tells me to wait in another line to pay and get my baked goods ANOTHER LINE I see them place things in boxes and wrap them up the NY way in red and white string which is great but Im not getting 2 dozen italian cookies and I could forgo the boxing because I was handing out the treats to my family in 10 minutes So we wait and wait and wait some more around 20 minutes to pay The poor cashier needs to go to a line of waiting orders type in everything the person ordered and ring them up then call the persons name  which is horrible inefficient Overall it took probably 40minutes from standing in line to finish and they forgot my 3 layer cookie which cost a fortune Never ever go there Save yourself for a true italian bakery in NY This place is waste of time and money,negative,303,300- 500,1535,1500-2000
Mediocre quality for prices that are way too much All drinks were 13 and above Ham egg and cheese was the highlight of the meal,negative,25,<50,131,<500
Its an ok place Very cute and colorful place but not a wide selection on flavors I had the Vietnamese coffee and it was pretty good tasted like a frozen coffee treat lol I thought that there would have been a wider selection of flavors but there werent Again its a cute and colorful place but when I think of ice cream this wont be the 1st place I would consider going too,negative,73,50-75,382,<500

I wish I could give Bouchon Bakery a better review especially after our ecstatic meal at Bouchon the night before but it sorta sucked I like the cute little stand hidden away from everything else just enter the Venetian and keep walking back and back from the casino floor not a fan of the lack of seating the food court is just upstairs and down a hallway a bit though We had vanilla and pistachio macarons and some other small pastry Macarons were hard on the outside and the filling was cloying theyd been sitting for too long perhaps Big which is nice but ugh CHEWY Not a word I want with my lighter than air cookies Two stars because I have hopes and I really did enjoy Bouchon And the other pastries looked like they could be OK or even good,negative,142,100-150,768,500-1000
What a charming bakery They really have delicious desserts Love their lemon bar sfingi pistachio cheesecake lobster roll cream puffs Their tiramisu and Napoleon are also delicious There is no place to sit but you cant wait to go home and stuff your face with sweets after coming here  Owners and cashiers are super nice Come and support your local bakery ,positive,63,50-75,367,<500
Bouchon I really need to adjust my expectations accordingly because due to the hype I always associated Bouchon with all things awesome and so far all my experiences have bordered only OK to meh my other experiences Bouchon Bakery in NYC  Bouchon in Bev Hills But Im just mostly sadthe fool me once fool me twice thing now fooled me the third time During our trip here for NYE2012 we had some time to kill before all the festivities and took a walk on the strip I spotted Bouchon bakery and excitedly pointed out to my bestie that this place is suppose to have the BEST MACARONS That got her all excited too so we picked up a preboxed of mini 6 for 12 to share a bunch of different flavors and bask in its glory The first 3 out of the box were straight up stale We wouldnt have realized it until we got to the last 3 and realized how much better tasting those were At 2 for each dinky one that is unacceptable In the future I would definitely question the preboxed stuff and ask how long it has been sitting there The premium price tag should mean consistency I am disappoint,negative,206,200-250,1110,1000-1500
Loved the interior design the music and the staff Its a nice little shop with outdoor seating and nice lights Mucha Lucha was so tastyy that I will definitely have to come back for some more,positive,36,25-50,197,<500
Mitchells has some really good ice cream I mean its no East Coast Custard but the variety almost makes up for it There are tons of unique choices each time and plenty of old standbys The Ohio City location is cool Nice and roomy and bright and the train that goes around the restaurant is soothing It is best to go to the second floor where you can watch them making ice cream And a perk is that it stays open til midnight on weekends Score after a few beers at Nano Brew,positive,93,75-100,486,<500
Donut Bar was boppin Got there a few mins after opening on a weekday so there were no lines yet The employees were extremely helpful with their answers and recommendations and had really good attitudes Donuts were very good but word of advice make sure youre really hungry or will be sharing because some of them are huge The Homer Donut and Classic Glazed were as big as my teens face The Red Velvet donut was to die for and I typically dont like donuts Overall this is a good donut place and you should at least come once,positive,99,75-100,534,500-1000

My friends and I were really disappointed with our experience at Ninetys We had seen their instagram photos of delicious looking desserts and treats and so we made the drive from SW Charlotte to come check it out What we got was not worth the money The yumee bun was essentially a Hawaiian roll with ice cream and three pieces of cereal stuffed in it Nothing to be excited about The macarons were nothing special either Please just save your money and go elsewhere,negative,84,75-100,473,<500
Over sized over priced and under whelmed Its donuts No matter what you do on top of a donut youd better have a good recipe for the donut to start Not here typical Vegas inferior starting place topped with everything else and over charged Couldnt get a simple iced mocha right either Dont bother,negative,54,50-75,308,<500
I have never been treated so poorly until I went back to this establishment I returned because the order I had ordered the night before was not correct one of my banana splits had no bananas I was eating it at home when I said to myself something is missing I took a picture of my split without bananas along with my receipt Thats where I was treated horribly my the manager and the managers manager I was accused of possibly picking out the bananas was accused of eating it all even though I showed him a picture I have called and filed a complaint with corporate they were not impressed with my treatment was reported they would send a message to the owner of this facility Im still waiting for a phone call,negative,134,100-150,726,500-1000
Ive been watching the show for years So when I Walked upon the bakery I was super stoked Took my pictures and made my order I spent 30 on 2 cupcakes 2 eclairs a lobster tail and a cannoli And money is nothing for the price of some Good treats I got back to my room and it was horrible No flavor the cupcakes were dry and tasted like plain cream cheese in the icing and super soggy crust in everything else I havent been so disappointed in a while I wouldnt waste my money,negative,95,75-100,486,<500
I went to Masons Creamery for the first time last week and had one of the best ice cream experiences Not only was the staff super attentive and friendly but the ice cream was delicious and the flavors unique The texture was light and refreshing and getting three scoops allowed me to try a variety of flavors I especially liked the dark chocolate If you like ice cream this is definitely one of the top places in town to try,positive,80,75-100,431,<500

We were at the Venetian for brunch and my friends who are fans of the show I have never seen it wanted to stop by and check it out I had been warned before that the line to order is always long We waited in line for about 30 minutes or so The staff was very friendly and everything looked amazing I did think the prices were high though However I thought I would get some things to try see if they were worth the price I ordered an eclair 250 and it was very small 2 peanut butter cookies 195 each and an individual red velvet cake 995 which is way overpriced for one small cake In my opinion I dont think they were worth the money With those prices I expected it to be absolutely amazing They werent bad Ive just had better else where at half the cost If you dont mind waiting in the line and want to check it out do so I just dont think Ill be back again,negative,175,150-200,895,500-1000
I would have to use the word pretentious to describe this place Ive been here more than enough time to realized that Ive spent too much unnecessary time and money waiting in line to get mediocre pastries Yes yes its the only French bakery in Charlotte thats open 247 so I guess in a way you kinda dont have a choice if youre craving for pastries late night I usually just get the Napoleon bc I gave up on everything else that are offered there but for the past few times even the Napoleon is not even worth the wait anymore The price keeps increasing and yet it keeps getting smaller and smallerwhy The macarons are wayyyy too sweet Theyre supposed all be different flavors but to me they all just taste like sugar Their croissants are way too soft to be French crossiants Wheres the flaky buttery goodness that a crossiant supposed to have Their fruit tarts crust is too dense You can get one from Harris teether thatll probably taste the same for half the cost Amelies hasnt been the same and not particularly in a good way Good for a late night hangout spot if youre still in college but not so great for good quality French pastries,negative,211,200-250,1173,1000-1500
Im not sure if this place used to be better or what but we went tonight and were so disappointed We got the cookie ice cream cup ice cream was flavorless and icey macaron was hard and the marshmallow was burned It was also 8 dollars for a single scoop of ice cream The girl working was extremely unfriendly and service was sooo slow,negative,64,50-75,340,<500

Always saw a line so thought this must be good I went on 2 Tuesday The line was really super long I waited 40 minutes in the sun When I finally reached the front of the line a mean elderly lady cut me The lady argued could cut everyone because no one was ready to order but her This upset everyone waiting in the sun even more When I ordered the guy at the window slowly took my order would come back hand me an ice cream then tediously leave and close the window to go get another ice cream There has to be a better system It is not that this the worlds best ice cream and people are lining up getting speedy service and leaving People have to stand in a line for a long long time So do not get deceived with the long line of people like I did Regarding the ice cream I thought the ice cream was too sweet Besides the long line which requires standing within a bunch of angry frustrated consumers there are only three benches to sit and eat your ice cream They should add some ice cream tables,negative,198,150-200,1025,1000-1500
We were excited to be here DONT WASTE YOUR TIME We waited 20 mins in line only to be told we needed to order at the case and then get in line We along with several other guests went to order at the case only to wait another 10 mins and we got no help No one approached us no one acknowledged us the employees were to busy chatting among one another and were more attentive to stocking the souvenirs Several groups of guests left and as we were milling around the front one employee yells towards us I can help you now with such attitude as if she was doing me the favor BUDDY you need to look at this team and have them take some guest service lessonsit stems from the mangement and flows downhill If I was going to drop money on over priced desserts because of your Name Id rather not if getting treated like this,negative,160,150-200,833,500-1000
Tastes good but not allergy friendly We were told that one of the flavors had no dairy only eggs but it turned out it did in fact have cream Many of the sorbets contain corn and soy too,negative,38,25-50,190,<500
Overrated and too expensive for what it is The only thing I enjoyed was the toasted marshmallow and the macaroon The ice cream was bland and not that creamy I tasted a number of different options that all tasted like bland soggy cereal Staff was very patient with me during the tasting,negative,52,50-75,290,<500
My sister in law who lives in Las Vegas is obsessed with this bakery so we had high hopes and waited in line in their cramped space for about 1520 minutes which is not unusual I was told Unfortunately all the treats we tried tasted like frying oil and nothing else I couldnt even finish the lobster tail Ive had a few cannolis from Modern Pasty and Mikes in Boston as well as Madonias in NYC so I have tried some amazing cannolis and lobster tails Unfortunately I did not taste any good cannoli or lobster tails at Carlos Bakery,negative,100,75-100,549,500-1000
The only reason this place is getting a one star is because the cake pop was pretty good Other than that the cereal ice cream was BLAH The chocolate cookie was Eeehhhhhh i mean its a cookie it was whatever Coffee was no Dutch Bros These 4 items came in strong at almost 50 I know you go to Vegas to spend money but common Do yourself a favor and skip this place,negative,73,50-75,378,<500

Friends in town for a conventionthey had to go to Sprinkles I had never heard of it but loved the cupcakes They were very busy only one person working in cupcake side The young lady ha does each customer with patience and Love,positive,43,25-50,238,<500
Maybe it was too hot outside to eat a cupcake but I didnt care Sprinkles is awesome I try to go when in Vegas or LA and this Linq location was no different The Cupcake ATM is so fun,positive,39,25-50,187,<500
This dessert place is not 4 star worthy and everything was overly sugary The cereal milk ice cream was too sugary and my friend and I were not able to finish the ice cream because of the amount of sugar that was in the ice cream We shared the compost cookie and it tasted ridiculous It was by far the worst cookie I had ever tasted but the marshmallow cookie was alright It was not an enjoyable place and seems like a place that only drunks enjoy Save your money because everything is overpriced and not worth a dime,negative,99,75-100,525,500-1000
Worst French macarons I have ever had They were so stale that we went back to get a new one They told us they were between 24 days old and had no idea which ones were recently made The second one we got was harder than the first We just threw them out They brought shame to such an exquisite treat However the guys at the bakery were very nice,negative,70,50-75,352,<500
Let me start by saying that the quality of their ice cream is good however I called to ask if they had a product that theyve been out of for months and the ownermanager responds that he wouldnt put something up if he didnt have it However Ive come here before and it was posted as if I they had it in stock only to find out that they didnt have it due to supply issues Bottom line he was rude unprofessional and quite frankly a jerk I will never patronize this business again,negative,94,75-100,492,<500
Absolutely terrible We threw away the cookies and cupcakes we bought because they tasted so bad,negative,16,<50,97,<500
All of the positive things I have to say about this place have to do with the branding and the service  the guy working was super nice and patient waiting for us to make up our minds for what probably felt to him like forever We were having so much trouble because the drink menu looked SO tempting Eventually we ordered a cocoa puffs chocolate brownie ice cream monstrosity for him a coconut milkmatcha drink for me 20 sugar yes they allow you to choose your sugar percentage down to the percentage point Awesome So something really awful must have happened for me to give one star at this point right Yeah The drink happened The drink was just terrible Instead of using actual coconut milk they used what tasted like an avalanche of artificial coconut flavor Maybe there was actual coconut milk under there but I honestly couldnt tell It tasted like a Mounds bar The matcha layered on top was visible you know visually but tastewise it may as well have been green water Then to top it off the boba were like Aunt Jemimas maple corn syrup sweetness bombs The combination was so repugnant that I failed to finish my drink even though it was 110 outside I had just finished rock climbing and I was parched It just made me feel nauseous to sip it We ended up going somewhere else to get cold drinks The guy working did let me know that he would be willing to adjust my drink if I didnt like it  but there are no adjustments that would have saved this drink beyond throwing it away and starting over,negative,280,250-300,1548,1500-2000
Wow it has been six years since my original review for Masons Creamery shortly after their debut at the Cleveland Asian Festival Since then theyve expanded beyond the mobile ice cream popups and have opened a retail store They do a great job and have earned a loyal following not just for their delicious and creative ice cream flavors but during the cooler months for their savory hot and comforting ramen noodles  so popular that they often sell out They closed for about a week when they need to do a season change in order to transition from ice cream counter store to ramen bar The added seating in the front is much welcome and needed to make room for their legion of fans For ice cream they added freshly cooked egg waffle option a traditional yummy Hong Kong style waffle that has many round pillows of goodness that gets folded into a cup and in the middle of which the ice cream scoops are placed Very tasty with a delicious fresh still warm waffle in contrast to the ice cream Additionally they added Affogato espresso poured over ice cream They have dozens of constantly rotating flavors to try Im adding a photo of my purple Ube Ice Cream  unique and yummy  in a fresh warm egg waffle So good Also includes my extra caffeine kick with an Affogato over salted caramel ice cream,positive,237,200-250,1324,1000-1500
Had to come here after watching Chefs Table even though its not the same location Crack pie was gross Milk soft serve just tasted likemilk Why do people eat that,negative,30,25-50,171,<500
Do you like mush This was the most disgusting ice cream Ive ever had It could be in part because there was minimal to no ice cream added to the ice cream pint despite that supposedly being the main ingredient I would not recommend this item to anyone It looked like poop See photo,negative,54,50-75,288,<500
Not too impressed Their mocha was soso and the macarons are huge but not quite up to par We got Pistachio The pistachio flavor was good but the cream inside was oily and not good at all Vanilla Fake vanilla taste almost coconutty and not good at all Coffee Not bad pretty normal Overall I would definitely rather go to other places like Payard for macarons but I guess drinks are good enough,negative,73,50-75,411,<500
Best donuts Ive ever had and Ive been goin there since I was prolly 5 and Im now 34 Used to walk there almost everyday in the summer And I remember when I was younger the free smiley face chocolate donuts they would give the kids So sweet My fav,positive,50,25-50,258,<500
Ugh what a letdown Huge lines and lots of buzz but when it came time to eat the pastry itself it was horrible Had the creme horn  something was off in general and didnt taste right but that was overshadowed by the outer cakes consistency which was as if uncooked pasta was wrapped around it  a hard practically unchewable outer layer I assume its supposed to be crispy I cant imagine thats what they were going for terrible,negative,80,75-100,446,<500
Got the cookie cup with cookies and cream ice cream red velvet macaron and the toasted marshmallow Knew from the first look at the ice cream it wasnt going to be great and was unfortunately right It wasnt cookies and cream in the traditional sense and was fairly terrible to be short The ice cream tasted more creamy and had that freezer burn taste as if it was left out and then had been refroze We did try the strawberry guava and that was actually great and disappointed we hadnt gone with that Needless to say we wont be returning Not sure how this place got such high yelp reviews but its probably due to the fad of the cookie cup and it is definitely not worth it,negative,128,100-150,685,500-1000
Cute retro candy shop aesthetic and the ice cream was amazing My girlfriend and I got an Oh my Affogato and a Salted chocolate chunk cookie ice cream sandwich,positive,29,25-50,162,<500
Jenis denied my 6 year old ice cream No cash excepted nice to know once you wait in line for 30 min Even offered to let them keep the change out of a 20 Its real nice that Jenis cant take care of those that take care of them We have supported them 2 times a week since they opened never again,negative,62,50-75,304,<500
Came here one night with a friend and I was so impressed Brandon was so kind and asked all about ya and where we are from since we just moved here He let us sample flavors and they all were delicious He really took his time and we felt like valued customers Very good with covid protocol 6ft apart all had masks on and sanitized the desk area Would def come back for the donut melt,positive,76,75-100,390,<500
I know the City of Charlotte loves to hype up new businesses and support is important but you lose credibility when you exaggerate on reviews Based on the 5 star review I had to give it a try I mean its a win win situation right WRONG Its a very small bakery with a small variety of desserts Nothing really popped out at us as its mostly cookies brownies and on this day a slice of Snicker Cake which was NOT good At 6 per slice its also very expensive The cake was not moist at all and the frosting was hard and not creamy at all I didnt get the feeling or taste of a Snicker Bar with the exception of the occasional peanuts in the cake The service was friendly but I definitely wont be back It did not fulfill my sweets craving,negative,145,100-150,756,500-1000
First time being back after they moved to their current location inside Jobot coffee I got the biscoff ice cream and really liked it but I didnt really care for the other flavors I sampled Not that many places have biscoff flavored ice cream so thats great they have it but thats probably the only thing I would order there hence the 4 stars,positive,64,50-75,347,<500
Came to Handels with my sisters and waited 20 minutes for what shouldve been 5 This is what my milkshake looked like when it came out then I had to wait additional time until they realized they forgot part of my order Very disappointing,negative,44,25-50,242,<500
The staffs were taking their time After theyve scooped out my ice cream they were still helping out the people in front of us very slowly I waited at least 3 minutes before they gave me my ice cream its been sitting on their countertop by the time they handed it to me it was already melting They also got my order wrong which they provided a refund but by the time I finally got what I wanted Ive already lost my interest of having ice cream First time walking out of an ice cream store with such disappointment,negative,99,75-100,529,500-1000
Refreshing dessert worth the price You can have the soft serve by itself or ahboong upsidedown style with a filledtaiyaki on top Definitely a good amount of combos to try and theyre all pretty and seems good,positive,37,25-50,216,<500
ive been trying to get their soft serve but the machine has been broken for 3 days i go almost everyday to see if they have it and i just waste my time,negative,33,25-50,153,<500
From the current soft opening I can say I am IMPRESSED It blows the other bakeries out of the water The stuff comes out fresh and it isnt left overnight All the items and individually wrapped as you are checking out That way you are taking home pastries that will last and not go stale Tons of variety of pastries I believe they have a few types of egg tarts lots of buns with filling inside Green tea buns cheese cake tarts plenty of fruit cakes chocolate moose cake To many to name as I dont even remember what I ate BE FOR WARNED they are busy especially as the open up and so far even if you come mid afternoon they can run out of stuff quickly,positive,128,100-150,662,500-1000
There are two Bouchon locations at the Venetian Resort This one is for the quick service bakery counter hidden underneath the back stairs on the casino floor It is somewhat hard to find but worth the effort The location mirrors the bakery shop located in Yountville serving a limited selection of French style pastries and coffee There was no line when I visited which allowed me to get a blueberry Croissant and chocolate Macaron paired with an espresso with little effort The pastries were very good although the blueberry Croissant was a regular one cut in half and filled with cream and fruit instead of baked in The Macaron was very delicious with good flavor and texture My espresso was done well and served in a tiny cup with a tiny plastic lid This is a great place to enjoy the famous Bouchon pastries without waiting at the actual restaurant It is hard to find but impossible to forget,positive,159,150-200,908,500-1000
I couldnt be more of a fan of Mitchells Fresh vibrant flavors from great local ingredients Anyone who says this place isnt the best ice cream is entitled to their opinion however wrong it may be,positive,36,25-50,203,<500
I have tried many ice cream places that serves the cookie monster flavor and in my opinion Novel Ice cream serves the best It is a cute small red cabin that has a very helpful staff The first time I came in this shop the owner explains right away how the ice cream is made and ask how our day was Its not every day where shops ask about how our day is This shows how they care about their customers Novel Ice cream doesnt disappoint,positive,86,75-100,440,<500
We stopped in on a Sunday afternoon around 4PM The inside of the shop was very cute We ordered the butterscotch pudding and the orange olive oil cake with honey cream The total of these two desserts was close to 14 The butterscotch pudding was served in an espresso cup so there was not much of it We were shocked by the high price but thought it could be worth it We took the desserts home to eat The butterscotch pudding was okay Most of the olive oil cake was pretty dry although some portions were moist We did pick up the cake later in the day so we may not have come at the best time We would like to return again but earlier in the morning,negative,128,100-150,662,500-1000
BEST ice cream parlor  EVER My favorite flavor is the peanut butter Today I mixed peanut butter with Trefoil Swirl and it was AWESOME,positive,25,<50,137,<500
I went twice in one day it was so good On my second visit it wasnt as good The ice creams taste was very delicious though Portions arent the best and the almonds in my rocky road were a bit stale tasting the second time around Be prepared to stand inline because it can get busy,positive,56,50-75,290,<500
Great ice cream with decent pricesHad ice cream for four Would definitely come back here for more You have to try this place,positive,23,<50,128,<500
I love anything Bouchon so the only reason this review isnt 5 stars is because none of the 3 bakeries in the Venetian had a large selection I suppose Im spoiled after visiting the Napa location so many times but hey Vegas is full of extravagance so I was a little disappointed as I was looking for treats to take home Even so everything we picked was wellreceived and enjoyed ,positive,71,50-75,386,<500
There was no wait My friends and I all got the single cereal milk soft serveThe portion is way bigger than the New York location It was like a meal in itself I like how they layered the bottom with corn flakes It was a pleasant surprise It tastes just as good as the New York location I would definitely recommend sharing Recommendation cereal milk soft serve,positive,67,50-75,368,<500
All hype The cookies were crunchy and had a weird texture The ice creammilkshakes were nothing special Im would not go back there,negative,23,<50,135,<500
What is not to like in this place  Too many options for desserts  Maybe  This place has been our stopover whenever we pass by Charlotte They serve a variety of pastries especially the sweet ones  Their salted caramel sweet pastries can be trusted at all times to surprise you It is difficult to get the right balance between the level of saltiness and sweetness I think they have perfected it Their other pastries are definitely worth a bite Again dont blame yourself for being confused and undecided Their addendum to coffee are interesting Give the spicy mocha a shot  Bottom line Absolutely French  Wonderfully delicious,positive,111,100-150,644,500-1000
I am lactose intolerant Well not me so much as my stomach Not to be too descriptive but I dont feel well after eating foodsdrinks with dairy For Sweet Republic I am willing to deal with the pain Sweet Republic has fantastic Ice Cream Ice Cream sandwiches and more Since it is an individually owned and operated business the deserts taste slightly different every time I goand that is great Unlike chains Sweet Republic is creating ice cream with unique and sometimes slightly changing recipes,positive,85,75-100,514,500-1000
This is my favorite ice cream place in Cleveland and well worth the wait if theres a line Ive never had a flavor that wasnt great but what keeps me coming back is the honey pecan,positive,36,25-50,185,<500
Showed up and the one attendant they had working was sweeping while not wearing a mask or gloves Then went straight to the register when a customer arrived who also was not wearing a mask and began to take his order take his money scoop his ice cream and serve him without even washing his hands first using hand sanitizer or putting gloves or any kind of mask on My girlfriend and I just walked away and drove offId rather pick up some Thriftys ice cream than support a business that doesnt care enough about their customers or society as a whole to even just wash their hands let alone at least wear a mask,negative,115,100-150,627,500-1000
If I could give this place 100 stars I would I was in Arizona for vacation and was down in Phoenix for one last day The temperature reached to 105 degrees and I was in need for something cold to eat of course I wanted ice cream After looking through many reviews I saw that Novels reviews were very good and decided to take my dad there Its a small shop located amongst other small shops really cute and although there was no indoor seating to avoid the scorching heat the ice cream totally took away from all that not to mention we stood inside and talked to the owners and workers out of the heat Speaking of the staff they were all amazingly kind warm and welcoming making us feel very at home in their little shop Immediately walking in one of the owners explained their ice cream to us explaining how it was hand made with rotating flavors I greatly appreciated that and he offered us to try as much as wed like I got what they called the Leslie Knope a waffle ice cream sandwich but they also offer a donut sandwich which I thought was extremely appetizing as I saw someone take it out I tried their Cookie Monster in between the two waffles and it was amazing I thought it was so good I wanted to try more and I sampled their sorbets the Freckled Lemonade and Honeydew Sorbet Both were amazing and I got another scoop because I couldnt help myself My dad had the same idea and got something called the Bourbonsomething something and the Fat Elvis I got to try quite a lot of flavors along with those and they were so rich and tasty I highly recommended what I listed above Because we stayed inside one of the owners was so friendly to my dad and I got to chat with the others who just made friendly conversation with me I absolutely love the vibe and of course the ice cream and if Im ever in Phoenix again Ill be stopping by,positive,351,300- 500,1885,1500-2000
At 14 a slice I got refrigerated flavored birthday cake It was so bad that I was so upset for paying that much for a cake I didnt eat The frosting tasted like whipped sugar nothing else The cake was so dry and it looked like it was made days ago I kept tasting small bites to get a flavor but it had none I was so confused as to why its so famous Im from Los Angeles and we have one there So disappointing I will never go back while in Vegas or to the one in my town Overpriced overhyped Tasteless cake smh its a pretty slice to look at thats about it,negative,115,100-150,569,500-1000
Firstly I have to say that Hopscotch does a great job in their cake decoration Unfortunately the cakes dont taste nearly as good as how they look I bought Hopscotchs berry buttercream 6 vanilla cake for a birthday party The cake cost 40 and was quite small but welldecorated so I expected it to taste great and impress the other guests I even hyped it up at the party so people were expecting some great cake Sadly the cake was very disappointing The buttercream was bland and tasteless and the cake was dry and stale like old pound cake I have to say that even the generic cake from Meijer tastes better I was pretty embarrassed to say the least If all you want is a cake that looks pretty in a picture then by all means come to Hopscotch But whatever you do dont count on their cakes tasting any good,negative,152,150-200,835,500-1000
I aint gonna lie I had high hopesbut was let down I saw the long line and thought oh this must be good Not so muchit was just average not sure if the quality was lost in the transfer to Las Vegas When I go to New Jersey Ill have to try the original But for now the Las Vegas spot missed the mark Then you add in the high prices they charge and ouch that makes it hurt worse ,negative,81,75-100,394,<500
too sexy for Milan too sexy for New York and Japan That old 80s song pops into my head every time I walk into this place Its so hip it hurts Its been riding the wave for several years based solely on being the only French cafe in town not counting Cafe Monte another faux French establishment Its also located in a very edgy part of town meaning there are nonwhite people on the streets The coffee and pastries are nothing special Youd think they were ambrosial given some of the reviews but you can get better at Whole Foods Even so Id still make the drive except for the abysmal service as it does make a nice change from the claustrophobic suburban paradise that is Charlotte It can take them upwards of 30 minutes to make a sandwich Heaven forbid that you should ask that your pastries be boxed rather than crammed into a bag Yes you say but its a French bakery doesnt the attitude go with it Frankly no Ive been to French patisseries in France in US and European cities Ive yet to encounter the attitude Ive experienced at Amelies Go if you are bored out of your mind as it is open 247 but dont make a special trip for the food It really isnt that special,negative,222,200-250,1214,1000-1500
I visit every time Im in Charlotte The menu items are DELICIOUS but the customer service is very questionable I have had anywhere from awesome customer service to really poor customer service however the good outweighs the bad with this place My only suggestion is to ensure the quality of customer service is consistent,positive,54,50-75,328,<500
If I could give NO stars I would We got there at 1050pm trust me we ran I bolted in and apologized to the manager for being so late All for him to tell me no more orders were closed Ive already closed the registers down DONT FREAKING ADVERTISE HOURS TILL 11pm AND CLOSE AT 1050pm,negative,56,50-75,297,<500
Dont get the big deal The almond croissant bore no resemblance to a croissant Was a doughy undercooked chunk of bread loaded w overwhelming almond paste Are fans of the tv show really thinking this is what an almond croissant is The cupcake was good and the dark chocolate mousse tart was ok Very sweet Only reason to come here was the cannoli which was excellent,negative,66,50-75,372,<500
Ive been to Amelies a handful of times and Im sad to report I dont like it I DO love the decor and I DO love the assortment of desserts and pastries Heres what I dont like the place is always crowded and the food and espresso drinks are overpriced I paid about 450 for a small latte which costs less than 3 most other places The woman at the register was in a foul mood and was very short with me when I asked for skim milk Apparently they dont have skim milk only soy The latte was not good I threw it away on my way out the door Ive had the croque monsieur which was extremely greasy and the turkey and brie sandwich wasnt great either Im pretty sure Im the only person in Charlotte who doesnt like their salted caramel brownies how can they call that thing a brownie anyway About half of the staff members Ive interacted with were downtoearth pleasant individuals the others were haughty and downright snotty 50 is not good enough in my book,negative,182,150-200,991,500-1000
I was pointed in the direction of Amelies by a classmate who seemed to be a fan of the breakfast sandwiches which he said were usually sold out if you dont get there early enough I figured this was a sign that it was a good cafebakery The first couple times I went I bought an assortment of pastries to try  most were pretty great I had given some to my parents to taste and my mother insisted her birthday cake come from there I live 90 minutes away so this wasnt exactly easy planning On my next trip I purchased several french macarons and after getting them home discovered a small hair sandwiched into 1 of them I emailed Amelies through facebook to explain what happened just to let them know someone needed to be a little more careful I received an email back from Lynn profusely apologizing including the same formatted apologies Ive seen from her in response to some reviews on here and offering to make up for the mishap She gave me a separate email address to contact her with additional information I emailed her back at the address she provided and told her I didnt want anything for free I assumed the apology and promise to check their procedures was sincere  and only wanted some help picking out a birthday cake for my mom as I was short on time I never received any response I followed up a few days later on facebook to see if she got my email and again no response I sent a 3rd and final email December 26th 3 months after the fact and finally got a response 8 days later apologizing for dropping the ball and offering a gift card to make up for it I received another email this morning because she forgot to copy the gift card person on what happened Really This is a comedy of errors that just isnt all that funny so I wont be back,negative,335,300- 500,1791,1500-2000
So delicious The ice creams are fantastic They have fun limited flavors in addition to the usual selections Info about these limited flavors are available on their Instagram The waffle cones and bowls are super light and crunchy and beautifully flavored We always add a bag of handmade marshmallows or almond toffee brittle to our order We are addicted to this place,positive,62,50-75,374,<500
I love this place Its a staple from college and worth a trip here everytime Its such great custardit makes me want to make the sucky drive down 57 right now,positive,31,25-50,164,<500

A San Francisco classic located in an alley way in the middle of the strip Typically known for its chocolate youd regret sleeping on the ice cream This was our last stop in Vegas before heading home and it was the perfect treat for breakfast haha We got a double scoop of Rocky Road and Cookies n Cream in a freshly baked waffle cone still hot off the press The Espresso Chip was also tasty if you like the coffee flavor but is even sweeter when stuffed inside a chocolatedipped cone The rest of the store offers an assortment of different chocolate options If youre picky enough to care they even get into the specific percentage of cacao in the different pieces Youll definitely be paying a premium for the chocolate gifts bags so my suggestion is to stick with the ice cream,positive,143,100-150,795,500-1000
Since watching Chefs Table I have been clamoring to try Milk Bar in NY but wont be going for a few months I was surprised and excited to wander by this one in LV I do not have a big sweet tooth but was intrigued by Chef Christina Tosis innovation and passion as portrayed on Chefs Table I decided to try the ICED CEREAL MILK LATTE and it was sooo good The cashier confirmed it was not too sweet and she was right It was not overly sweet but it was amazingly delicious with a slight hint of cereal milk flavor It was so good I wanted to come back the next day for another one in a larger size,positive,120,100-150,603,500-1000
Dont waste your time or money coming herecookies are pre packaged the slice of cake I got was dry and the milkshake lacked flavorhonestly a milkshake from McDonalds or Jack in the box would of been better Wasted over 40,negative,40,25-50,228,<500
After moving to the area my SO and I were given the recommendation to check out this bakery We made the trip over on a Sunday morning It was a bit of a drive from where we live but it was highly recommended We got there and due to the early morning daytime it wasnt busy After a brief study of the pastry case we made our selections Palmiers a couple of croissants an eclair and a few other things We took our items to go in our usual practice of eating at home The quality and taste overall was a bit meh It seemed like they didnt use full butter and cream that is expected from French pastries Perhaps lower quality substitutes The overall conclusion was that weve had better and it wasnt really worth the trip The layout and decor was a bit artsy and a little overdone It seemed cluttered to us but take into account that we are both trained to look for points of egress in an emergency You can probably take the review with a grain of salt because Ive been cooking and baking for 26 years and taught culinary for a number of those years and weve both been all over the world and had many local cuisines in our travels Our expectations tend to be higher than most,negative,226,200-250,1199,1000-1500
I used to love coming here as a college student eating pastries and doing school work either by myself or bringing other classmates However recently Ive noticed the inconsistency of food quality For the past couple months every item Ive purchased has tasted like its been in the fridge all day So when I ate it it was either dry hard or both I think this is my last time coming to this location Im hoping the one theyre building uptown will taste as good as the Noda location used to if not the company has lost a customer entirely,negative,100,75-100,554,500-1000
Fantastic find in charlotte We found this place as we were driving through and felt like we had a detour in Paris on our way to Hilton Head The sandwiches coffee and dessert were all amazing Of course the atmosphere makes it so welcoming to sit down Dont let this seeming out of way location deter you from coming,positive,59,50-75,321,<500
Weve been on the search for a good bakery that offers good fresh baked goods We stumbled upon this place after our adventure from the hot dogs They just opened not too long ago but still had a pretty decent sized line outside We didnt know what to expect but a line out the door to get in we thought was a good sign right When you get in you immediately smell the freshness of baked goods They have multiple casings with different baked options and also have similar options in multiple casings So if its out in one casing it could be in another There were sooo many options I dont know where to begin or say Everything was fresh and you can get things from fresh baked bread to tarts to taro flavored small loads and cranberry cream cheese roll Our favorite was the chocolate mocha loaf and taro loaf We only got 6 items and are sad we only got 6 We found out theyre also in California which we will be there soon so were going to be stocking up People are 5050 about the pricing but we think its definitely worth it,positive,197,150-200,1041,1000-1500
I think I may be the only person in Charlotte that does not like this place The ambiance is great but the baked goods are pretty terrible It tastes like the prepackaged stuff you can buy at Starbucks,negative,38,25-50,204,<500
Yummy matcha latte and such a cute place inside I will definitely be back next to hangout for a bit in the cute decor,positive,24,<50,119,<500
Everything was tasteless I cant even explain how disappointed we all were It was OK not good just ok so not worth the money in my opinion 9 for a slice of cake Cannoli eclair and lobster tail were mediocre I dont understand how to describe it Its like the didnt add any flavoring like vanilla almond etc just sugar Theres no depth you just get sweet with no other flavor I will not return,negative,75,50-75,410,<500

Meh not terribly impressed Didnt particularly like the ice cream and the service was not great Disappointing,negative,17,<50,113,<500
This place blows away all the other corporate ice cream shops It definitely lives up to the hype Some of the flavors are definitely different but whether you are craving that or just some traditional flavors this is the place The almond buttercrunch is so decadent creamy and rich with chunks of homemade almond brittle I cant get enough The salted caramel ice cream is also very good The sweet cream flavor in it is amazing They didnt have the bacon brittle ice cream the day we went but I cant wait to try it My new favorite ice cream spot Ben and Jerrys and Haagen Daz WHO,positive,108,100-150,595,500-1000
I have been going to Prestis since the late 70s when I lived on 126th Normally I enjoy the experience but not on the morning of 726 I tried to use the restroom but the door was looked After waiting a few minutes I tried again thinking that maybe the door was locked but not in use I knocked but got no response An employee walked by and I asked her to try the door She did but again no response A kitchen employee finally came out I said its about time his response was  youre a effin ahole  a debatable take I asked him to repeat but he declined as he shoved his way into the kitchen I asked the young lady who was very kind if there was a manager there and she called the gentleman over I believe his name is Tom I explained the situation his response was  did you say anything thru the door I told him I knocked and asked if anyone was in there and told him that an employee had done the same He repeated the question I repeated my answer His response was a halfhearted apology and  everyone has to go to the bathroom  no debate there I will probably be back to see Isaac but I will spend more time at Corbos and some of the numerous options in the area,negative,236,200-250,1188,1000-1500

We live in Peoria but happened to be in the area I knew that this place had been in 50 Reasons to love Phoenix according to Phoenix Magazine Lets just say Im an ice cream lover and this place did not disappoint I could tell right away by looking at the vanilla ice cream that it was white rather than that artificial yellow color I knew then that they were using natural ingredients and letting the deliciousness of cream eggs sugar and vanilla shine I got the salted caramel ice cream It was delicious I could taste each ingredient The prices were a little pricey but then again the quality is in a different league compared to the artificial frozen gunk you would get at bask in Robbins The server was quick and friendly The only negative is that both locations are far On the plus side that is good for my waistline,positive,153,150-200,836,500-1000
This place is amazing I secretly knew Thomas Keller couldnt disappoint me After visiting Bouchon in LA I knew we had to make a pit stop to his bakery here Ive personally never had a good macaroon before but Bouchon has since convinced me such deliciousness exists The chocolate macaroon was beyond heavenly I cant wait to try the other flavors next time The chocolate croissant was to die for too Crispy on the outside but soft and chocolatey on the inside What more could you ask for The BF also ordered their mocha special and was pleasantly surprised by the hint of nutmeg Everything here was outstanding,positive,108,100-150,624,500-1000
Great atmosphere amazing dishes I had the chicken  it was fabulous Others at my table had steak  the ham  cheese It was quite the treat My only complaint is that the tables are so packed in that the man behind me kept hitting me with his chair or arm or back,positive,54,50-75,267,<500
We come here ALOT maybe 23 times a week for lunch and I even recommended and showed many of my friends this place We usually have great experiences here but today 62422 1220p we encountered Emily who was probably the rudest employee weve ever encountered in this shop We were standing in the isle not busy at all Im holding a baby my wife is holding a tray full of bread and treats and Emily comes by loudly saying EXCUSE ME so we both stand out of the way Then louder she goes CAN I GET THROUGH because apparently she wanted to refill the bread that we were standing by but first of all how do we know you wanted to get through Second of all you could let us know you wanted to get there in the first place instead of the run around We wouldve simply went out of the way Third it was not busy at all so why rush us out of the way Just a fyi we spend 50 every visit here on goodies and now Im sort of regretting How can you be so upset with us who didnt even say a word to you the whole time Quite disappointed someone please talk to Emily about customer service Ive worked in the customer service industry as a manager for over 10 years and I would be upset if my employees treated customers this way,negative,240,200-250,1243,1000-1500
Lovely little local place with locallymade fresh frozen desserts I got blueberry sorbet and vegan banana as I am lactoseintolerant boo Sister got Lucky Charms lucky and a butter finger sort of ice cream She said they were very good My blueberry sorbet was outstanding but the banana tasted like something I could make at home with a yonana maker Should have sampled it first OH well It was a lovely evening so the outdoor seating was on point Worth a drive or walk to try if youre in the area visiting or after a baseball game,positive,97,75-100,546,500-1000
Place is cute Super busy but thats fine Sweets are great but way to over priced Still a great place to go and hang out at any hours of the day and night,positive,33,25-50,159,<500
We were very keen to try this ice cream but the customer service is pathetic There were hardly 3 people and the ladies at the counter preferred to be standing idle at checkout counter vs helping all the customers This place might have good ice cream but with such customer service nothing will taste good Pathetic,negative,56,50-75,319,<500
This place is great Pricewise wasnt bad at all for 2 cones and 2 scoops of icecream each was less than 1000 They have all yummy flavor we both got the Vietnamese ice coffee and Thai ice tea flavor which was super creamy and sweet The service here is super friendly and fast This place also have a lot of space for parking as well,positive,65,50-75,341,<500
The food is great this low review is because I am extremely disappointed by their lack of recycling The amount of cups cans bottles that this place goes through on a daily basis goes to rot in a landfill for any profitable business this is unacceptable Do better for the world that allows you to run a profitable business Great deserts tho,negative,62,50-75,347,<500
Enjoyed their classic hot fudge sundae last night Delicious as always I typically get these at Giants games in San Francisco I never thought Id be paying more for these anywhere else than at the ballpark but Vegas managed to do that 14 each Oh well Im on vacation Nevertheless its always fun to visit a premium chocolate shop We didnt buy anything else besides a couple sundaes Id have had to sell an extra kidney to do so Youre better off financially buying their product at Costco Staff were friendly pleasant ambiance,positive,93,75-100,542,500-1000
I dont understand how this place has as many stars as it does PLEASE do not go here I am saving you a TON of money There are literally hundreds of other places in Vegas that have wayyy better ice cream for the price including the grocery store or your local 7eleven My wife and I came here based on high recommendation from a friend We were told to get the brownie sundae  Lands End But they didnt have brownies I guess I should have offered to run to the local Walmart to grab them a box of Ghirardelli brownies so instead we got the cookie bits sundae The ice creamsundae Im not joking  it was completely flavorless Everything was From the vanilla and cookies and cream ice cream to the hot fudge and cookie bits Shockingly flavorless The hot fudge wasnt even hot The service The person behind the counter was rude and completely unhelpful When I asked for the the Lands End sundae they responded like I was out of my mind for even asking for such a wild thing cause obviously I should have known they didnt have brownies It felt like my wife and I were such a burden on them for even being in the shop The price It was 1500 people Im telling you go to McDonalds for their 1 sundae and youll have a better experience at the very least McDonalds fudge will be hot I PROMISE you dont go here Go somewhere else Your taste buds family and wallet will thank me,negative,262,250-300,1423,1000-1500
This place is just ok at best Ive had Sprinkles cupcakes before and wasnt crazy about them but I wanted to try their ice cream anyway I opted for a scoop of their salted caramel ice cream in a cup I was warned by the guy at the counter that it was very salty I asked for a taste and did find it on the salty side so I asked for caramel sauce to make it sweeter and more caramely The ice cream was ok  not terrible but not among the best Ive had either As for the caramel sauce it was on the runnier side and I prefer it thick and more flavorful There is plenty of seating outside but it was just too hot to sit out there on the day we went Luckily there was counter seating on the cupcake side of the shop Ice cream is to the right when you enter cupcakes to the left We had to wipe the counter top though  there were crumbs galore on it It made no sense to me that they had a bunch of workers waiting to help on the cupcake side most were not helping customers as there was a lull in foot traffic and not one of them could wipe down the counter top We returned later in the day with a friend who wanted to try their cupcake ATM but it was out of service This is one of those places where I can say that Im glad that I tried it but I dont feel the need to come back,negative,268,250-300,1297,1000-1500
Best Ice Cream in Arizona The mango margarita sorbet and salted butter carmel are my favorites They constantly have fun thing new to try Dont forget the they have scooped and pre packed pints at whole foods around the valley also,positive,41,25-50,234,<500
Their vegan ice cream is on point I order it every time and Im not even vegan Its made with coconut milk and unbelievably creamy A must try,positive,28,25-50,145,<500
Unlike the reviews posted hearer about this place I was not impressed Everything is extremely expensive here and of average or below quality We had a chocolate eclair for 5 or so dollars that was dried out and I am sort of okay with paying 11 dollars for a ham and cheese baguette if it is really good but the cheese had dried out and the bread was stale Not very impressed at all,negative,74,50-75,387,<500
Very disappointing We ordered 6 cupcakes  the icing is horrible  Took them home to my kids because they are huge fans of the cake boss and we were very disappointed,negative,32,25-50,168,<500
I now understand how the French do croissantsbeyond buttery words and flakey crusts theres no way a lugubrious American hand could mend such a delicate intricate pastry With a shalelike dissembling these croissants will melt in the heat of your mouth and fill it with a slight sweetness that derives naturally from wheat gluten,positive,54,50-75,337,<500
asked what typeof coffee they served was answered with a shrug from a jerk of employee whom said its just coffee man he finally told me after several back and forwards that they serve a colombian blend i responded by telling him if he doesnt like his job to find another job he responded by flipping my cake upside down worst part was the cake is for my 14 year old daughter who was going through a break up and was really upset he did that  management made an aloof effort by asking us to drive back to the shop a nearly impossible feat however the 1 start goes to the corporate office they were attentive and assured me that their staff should know the coffee brands and should not flip chocolate mousse cakes upside downseemingly on purpose,negative,139,100-150,749,500-1000
I was very disappointed in the cereal milk soft serve There was no flavor and it wasnt good at all Ive ordered it at the NY location so I know what its supposed to taste like Total waste of 6 The crack pie was pretty good I ended up dipping it in the soft serve to try and give it more flavor,negative,62,50-75,302,<500
I had been looking forward to going to this chain of Milk Bar for so long as it was the closest one to me geographically and I had no idea when I would finally make it to NYC Id heard of its Crack Pie and unusual cookies for years hearing nothing but rave reviews I was so disappointed Crack Pie wasnt addictive as its name suggests the Birthday Cake pops tasted like other vanilla cake pops and the cookies didnt taste any better than homemade cookies Mouthfeel was boring and the flavors were flat If you like sweets and simple desserts then great If youre looking for something special go somewhere else,negative,112,100-150,623,500-1000
This place is insane Ordered delivery and they packed our ice cream with ice so it wouldnt melt Brownie batter swirl is AMAZING,positive,23,<50,130,<500
How is the selection here so bad Ive never been so disappointed by a visit to any of the 85C bakeries in California Ive already been to this location multiple times and I havent been happy with the selection even once I dont think theres any need to have so many trays of berry multigrain and not a single raisin milkor milk tea bun out On my last visit I heard 2 other customers also ask if there were any raisin milk buns only to be told that they were no longer making them for the night It was only 430 55 hours from closing Everyone Ive discussed this with has had the same experience I walk in with the intent to buy 24 specific varieties and walk out with 5 breads that I didnt want because it would be a waste of a drive So disappointing,negative,147,100-150,767,500-1000
This is my all time favorite Ice cream shop Its a little small inside but great seating outside Everytime I go the staff is super friendly and welcoming The prices is great not expensive considering they make their own flavors Thier Ice cream is just AMAZING They mix up thier flavors from time too So its always new and exciting My boyfriend got some bourbon flavor on a donut bun with cinnamon toast church so so good I got the Fat Elvis I highly recommend trying this place you wont regret it,positive,92,75-100,511,500-1000

absolutely the best wisconsin dairy ï½ž i love the rasberry and cherry flavour I personally recommend it as the best icecream ive ever tastedï¼,positive,24,<50,144,<500
Ive been to Jenis twice now and they have delicious ice cream The reason for the low stars is because both times I have visited the staff have made me feel like I have inconvenienced them by being there Its incredibly awkward My first visit I was greeted with a frown and eye roll I didnt even want to ask for a sample because it was that awkward My second visit was just the same I took my sister there and she even made a comment on the service We ordered the trio and went to sit outside I soon realized we were given a wrong flavor but did not want to go back into the store and deal with the staff and neither did she I am wary to go back because of my unpleasant experience both times,negative,139,100-150,707,500-1000
Desperately trying to seem trendy The ice cream we had didnt seem properly blended It was grainy Thats the only way I can describe it The flavor was decent The price is genuinely laughable given the quality I experienced The staff seems to be typical of a Scottsdale trendy location aloof yet confused as to how to treat a customer I wouldnt bother going back There are way better ice cream places in town,negative,74,50-75,418,<500
Disappointing I was incredibly excited to get some sweet treats from this place I love the show and love specialty goodies like these There were so many things to choose from  everything looked so good My friend had a chocolate fudge cupcake and I ordered the original cannoli and seasonal cupcake The cannoli The pastry was dry and clearly old When I took a bite the outside crumbed off not in a yummy flaky way and the inside of the cannoli was chewy and gross The filling inside was alright it was creamy but nothing spectacular I didnt even finish the cannoli because it was so lackluster Since I only tried one I cant tell if I got one of the old ones from a week before or if they are all like that Truly disappointing I would have expected a store bought like walmart cannoli to taste this terrible The seasonal cupcake Looked delicious Beautiful cupcake decorated in fallautumn colors with a chocolate leaf on top It was a vanilla cupcake with vanilla buttercream colored frosting The cake was pretty tasty not incredibly fresh but it wasnt old and crumbly like the cannoli The frosting was clearly homemade Good right Um no It tasted like straight up butter I bake occasionally and I have had this happen to me when I used too much butter and not enough sugar The frosting didnt even have a hint of vanilla taste to it Im glad it was homemade I just wish they wouldve put some Cream in the buttercream frosting Yuck My friends tried it and all felt the same way We took the frosting off and ate the cake part The chocolate fudge cupcake was alright I didnt try the frosting but the cake part was the same as the seasonal cupcake meaning it was edible Not worth the money or time spent waiting in line Seriously spend 3 on a Betty Crocker cake  its cheaper and tastes better sadly Id love to go back and try other items but with three out of three misses I doubt its worth the effort at this point Sad face,negative,359,300- 500,1978,1500-2000
I dont know why I always go back to donut bar I dont know why people like donut bar so much I dont get the hype But I love hype My favorite thing about donut bar is their creme brÃlÃe donut with the crunchy sugar coating and the creamy custard filling Why are they putting less coating and less filling Donut bar has the most bready donuts They are seriously just slightly sweet bread that are oversized or overly decorated I have probably tried all of their donuts and they are just not good in my opinion Their donut cone with soft serve is good and their creme brÃlÃe donut used to be good I have probably been here six times because their instagram is popping but I have to say their donuts are just not good,negative,137,100-150,731,500-1000
Presentation was nice but the flavor was not at all what I was expecting My SO and I both tried the cookie cups and were severely disappointed The best part was the marshmallow Over priced for a stale macaroon and ice cream that tasted like the milk left over when you finish your cereal Not to mention there was only one employee working on a Saturday night with a line out the door Probably wont try again,negative,77,75-100,415,<500
Great place to get some boom donuts from when I found this place I hate eating donuts from anywhere else,positive,20,<50,104,<500

This is a great place to stop in for a little bite if youre trying to hold out for dinner in another hour or 2 The pizza pieces are inexpensive and filling very thick dough but not doughy if you will Their sandwiches are also very good I think my favorite item in the whole place is the brownie cookie Its this rich chocolately cookie with powdered sugar on top Heavenly I cant review their gelato because theyve always been out or closed up that part when Ive been in From that view its probably very good,positive,97,75-100,527,500-1000
Great shop Sweet treats to beat the heat Very cool vibe and establishment Unique presentation great flavors Holy hell the ice cream is good and I love how it comes in a Chinese food to go box with fortune cookie Try the Thai ice cream,positive,45,25-50,241,<500
Prestis is one place I try to visit every time I visit family in Cleveland Its always been amazing and quintessentially Cleveland Today was just a profoundly sad day Took my parents there today before returning to Chicago We got there and the wait was painfully slow for service That I get But when there are other employees behind the counter who are taking down the showcase where the food is getting ready to close up thats when it becomes infuriating Half the menu was unavailable they claimed to have absolutely no panini which is what we came for and everything else in the case was sparse Oh and any restaurant that uses a microwave period is really not a place worth visiting Thank God I didnt order an espresso I saw the way they were made for the people in front of me and it was terrible From the way it came out of the basket it was either too sour or too bitter I spent 5k on a machine for my house trust me I know espresso Todays staff just didnt care Goodbye Prestis Too bad You had a great reputation You blew it A great tradition blown to hell,negative,202,200-250,1105,1000-1500
I have heard so many good things about Sprinkles and was excited to try it only to be disappointed I didnt love it I went somewhat later at night but you would think that they would have a decent selection seeing as it is the city that never sleeps Fair enough I had literally the cupcake with sprinkles on it The frosting was awful and dry The cupcake itself was nothing to write home about either I honestly feel that I have made better from a box at home It wasnt moist or flavorful at all Service was good fast and friendly but I wont be back to spend another 5 on a cupcake,negative,114,100-150,593,500-1000
Just stopped in for the first time Id say skip the fat and calories and just grab a cup of coffee This place is a diabetic coma nightmare Wow is this place over rated NO labels on anything I just saw cases of frosting on piles of dough I got a bacon maple and Boston creme The bacon was chewy and I threw more than half of it away Boston cream just fell apart in a heap of gross mess The frosting on the donuts was so gooey it was it a mess to eat maybe try some meringue powder in the recipe to help it set As far as the experience I told the woman it was my first time and had no idea what anything was so she just said point to something and Ill let you know what it is _ Made me want to turn around and go get an apple fritter from the market which is what I went in for in the first place but they did not have I also asked for a coffee and stood there like an idiot expecting her to hand me at least a cup or something but she just walked away I figured out on my own their coffee is self serve and they run off the honor system with what size cup you pick up The Columbian Supremo coffee was their one redeeming factor Thats one of the better cups of coffee Ive had since moving to Cleveland,negative,251,250-300,1234,1000-1500

March 2018 Update The location inside the house in the arts district is closed According to the girl working the lease was up They are now located in Jobot coffee shop on 3rd and Roosevelt When we arrived there was just a small set up outside with few flavors and no toppings same price though I do love Melt so I am hoping the service and quality to return after they are settled inside Jobot Fingers crossed Great little ice cream shop in the Roosevelt Arts district The flavors are unique and the prices are average for a mompop type place in this area The serve the ice cream in a Chinese togo box with a fortune cookie which is both creative and Instagram worthy Some of the flavors are poorly named leaving you to ask what Arizona Sunset is If he place is empty its fine but when you have a line out the door its time consuming,positive,159,150-200,860,500-1000
Their donut ice cream sandwich WAS DELICIOUS They had the most welcoming and kind staff Although it was a pretty penny their ice cream was worth it,positive,27,25-50,155,<500

I went to Fatty Daddys last year and loved it Good ice cream flavors and unique cookie cup I went back this year with friends and was so disappointed The cookie cup price didnt change but the lady said the menu changed I got two tiny scoops and one cookie instead of two Once my friends saw how small the portions were they didnt order anything The flavors werent as good this time either I dont plan on going back I can get a DQ blizzard for half the price and triple the ice cream Dont waste your money,negative,99,75-100,524,500-1000

When I first heard about Momofuku Milk Bar coming to Vegas I was so excited to finally try it Since Momofuku is a popular brand in NYC and I have never been to NYC it is nice to see that I am able to try it at home Momofuku Milk Bar is located on the second floor of the Cosmopolitan and it is next to Momofuku Noodle Bar which is opening in January Since they had a large selection of different types of desserts I got the cereal milk soft serve with crunch topping as well as some cookies and crack pie to take home to try Their cereal milk soft serve with crunch topping was very interesting because it had a salty tang to it which I didnt expect but it was good The items that I took home were the crack pie blueberry and cream cookie compost cookie and chocolate chocolate cookie The crack pie was quite small but it was really good in my opinion I did not like the blueberry and cream cookie since it taste saltier than expected and had the taste of a type of blueberry muffin that I did not like My favorite cookie was the compost cookie since it combined a coffee tasting cookie with a bunch of crunchy toppings The chocolate chocolate cookie was pretty good also,positive,226,200-250,1193,1000-1500
They have the BEST blueberry muffin Ive ever had Wow You have to try one It was so fresh and delicious There cheese danish was also very good if you like a lot of cream cheese filling Still very tasty,positive,40,25-50,208,<500
I used to work in Cleveland and every Wednesday was Doughnut Day the company would spring for doughnuts for all the employees and would buy the doughnuts ONLY from Prestis Let me tell you that I have never had a doughnut so delicious I have become utterly spoiled and cannot possibly eat a doughnut from Dunkin or Krispy Kreme they are just awful when compared I havent tried anything of theirs other than the doughnuts but if the doughnuts are this damn good the rest must be great as well,positive,90,75-100,506,500-1000
OkOkI know this review will not be favored amongst other yelpers Im not a huge fan of Amelies One night my boyfriend and I decided to hop in here on a dreary Saturday night after being in the Plaza Midwood area I was in search of a latte and he had a sweet tooth While the line was about 8 people deep it moved rather quick Ive since learned that this number of patrons was an anomaly as the line is usually wrapped around the room Anyways we tried the Salted Caramel Brownie that EVERYONE loves a few Tortes and a strawberry croissant First off they did not want to make a lattenot at all I dont blame them it was not that good I dont think I was able to finish all of it We were not impressed with the brownie either it was just a thick chunk of caramel plopped on top of a dry brownie Maybe we got a bad batch or something but it was not the raved about dessert that I was hoping for I had the same problem with their layered tortesdry and not flavorful The croissant wasnot the warm buttery pastry that you would envision I would love to love Amelies but I just dont I DO like the fact that its open 24hrs and I find it a good place to sit and people watch I plan on returning for a third time to try it once more have a plain coffee and sit to work on some writing,negative,257,250-300,1326,1000-1500

Absolutely nauseating If youre looking for very rich inyourface flavor  this is the place for you Their pints arent any better RIDICULOUSLY overpriced for ice cream Not sure if the Clevelanders who enjoy this are all acting or if they are too intimidated by the name and reputation to divulge how this ice cream really tastes Only tolerable thing is the frozen yogurt which is equally expensive but not as rich,negative,72,50-75,423,<500
I would highly recommend this bakery We moved to Champaign about a year ago and recently discovered it Their sweets and drinks are delicious After trying their lemon berry cupcake we decided to order the 10 cake version for our small backyard wedding We were a little worried about not seeing the cakeit not being an actual wedding cake but it was AMAZING It was beautiful and delicious and so reasonably priced We will continue to support them,positive,78,75-100,455,<500

I am a fan of the cupcake so of course when I heard that Las Vegas was getting a world famous Sprinkles I knew I had to check it out on my next visit The location is beautiful and as a former native and resident of Las Vegas was happy to see the Linq so beautifully developed and the Sprinkles location in the heart of it all I am sad to say I was very disappointed The line I kinda expected a long line but to see only two people behind the counter on a busy Saturday was shocking to me Also these two ladies were snakry with each other and one was rude and bossy to the other The cupcake my husband got the red velvet I chose the vanilla with sprinkles of course My husband said the red velvet was ordinary and when I snuck a taste of the cream cheese frosting I felt like I have had better I know vanilla is not the most unique flavor nor flavorful but I know that there are good vanilla cupcakes out there and this was not one of them It almost tasted bitter and had very little flavoring I was expecting some vanilla bean in the frosting with those tale tell little black flecks but I was let down The town where I live has a small regional cupcake bakery with a couple of locations that makes a far superior product in fact I have had grocery store cupcakes that were better Sorry Sprinkles I so wanted to like you,negative,261,250-300,1351,1000-1500
When i went into the bakery i was greeted and was asked what i would like As i was looking i instantly realized that the prices are more than anyone else charges It was to expensive for me I got a pastry and noticed that it wasnt that great for the price Portos is better than this place This Bakery is just novelty,negative,63,50-75,323,<500

Veeeery busy We stood in line for over an hour to try this place and it was well worth it The prices of everything are very reasonable especially the cannolis They have a wonderful selection of cakes and mini cakes cupcakes and everything else in between REAL CUSTOMER SERVICE Soooo my child was getting very frustrated and angry from waiting so long and by the time we got to the front she was screaming profusely She was acting crazy and being soooo loud THEN one of the bakers working in the back actually came out and gave her a free cookie I wish I knew her name but she was African American with glasses and I really want to THANK HER and say how much I appreciated that gesture of kindness I hope she gets a raise because I know she deserves it just by being a sweet person,positive,149,100-150,806,500-1000
I dont understand how I havent written a review about Churn yet Ive been here about 10 times and LOVE it In fact its the only place I get ice cream from Starting with the atmosphere its super cute and nostalgic They have vintage toys gum from when we were kids 2530 years ago sweets and a delectable selection of ice cream I have yet to be here where the service wasnt stellar Everyone has great recommendations plus you can try the ice cream Great selection of sweet treats whether you are looking for ice cream milkshakes candy cookies or cones My favorites include Vietnamese coffee ice cream and the Rocky Road Lil Freezy My husbands favorite is a chocolate milkshake with vanilla ice cream and their chocolate syrup Prices are more than a frozen yogurt place but youre getting quality ice cream sauces and mixins If you havent been here its a must Also an awesome place to go after youve eaten lunch or dinner at Joyride Federal or Windsor Its a local Phoenix business and we al love supporting our community so check it out,positive,187,150-200,1073,1000-1500
Ive been a fan of The Cake Boss for years and I could not wait to go to his bakery in Vegas Omg What a let down The prices are over the top for the quality The lobster tail was good but it was half the size of other bakeries and double the price but it is Vegas after all The cases were half empty and it was about noon The cases shouldve been full The staff was less than enthusiastic to say the least The cream puffs and eclairs looked terrible Like they were just thrown together I worked at a bakery in a grocery store for years and they made better cream puffs and eclairs than at Carlos Bakery It was a huge disappointment I expected top notch product and service They do keep the line moving quickly though Thats the only good thing,negative,146,100-150,758,500-1000
The service was slow but SUPER friendly which made this place worth waiting in line for They had a place now closed down just like this in London and when I went to the London it was amazing such a simple concept but so delicious Unfortunately my husband wanted one of the bowls but they were out of them so we can settled for shakes They were still good I would definitely recommend this place I loved seeing all the dÃcor of cereal boxes such a fun place,positive,88,75-100,470,<500
I have always visited the bakery every time we go to Las Vegas In the past I have brought cookies home Quite a lot This time when I went the only butter cookies they has were in a prepackaged plate In the actual bakery they has larger cookies and dessert I asked if they were fresh After being told yes I purchased three trays and several boxes to Bri g home Big big mistake Cookies were stale and broken into pieces What a huge waste of time money and effort They used to sell individual butter cookies and cookies in little boxes which were delicious I should have known by the lack of customers and no lines at all Will never waste my money or time there again Terrible terrible I threw them all out Do not throw away your money as I did,negative,144,100-150,763,500-1000
Delicious homemade ice cream waffle bowl was thin  crispy Salty Caramel Truffle was yummy with lots of mini chocolate caramel truffles in it Blueberry Cobbler had lots of blueberries and mint chip was refreshing  very minty,positive,38,25-50,228,<500
What a perfect way to begin a morning with Donuts from the Donut Bar The staff is always friendly donuts are amazingly delicious fresh and I love the creativity in trying new combinations The Blue Moon is my personal favorite so far I find myself checking Donut Bar Las Vegas on Facebook to see what tomorrows menu will be since it is always different Once they are gone they are gone for the day so I recommend getting here early especially on weekends for best selection and street parking is free before 8am Enjoy and Happy Yelping,positive,97,75-100,545,500-1000
Have been to Sprinkles in LA and San Diego I had the salted caramel cupcake and it was awesome This is a great addition to this area of shoppingbars,positive,29,25-50,152,<500
Yes they have Vegan donuts BUT their staff act like they dont know which ones are vegan or like Im from mars bc Im vegan I rather not have anything and drive 25 min back home than to give a place with bad service my hard earned money,negative,48,25-50,238,<500
Things to like Great variety of baked goods Cheap You can walk out with half the stores baked goods for 20 Medium quality Its a bakery better than your local grocery store but not quite as good as a specialty bakery Things to not like Overwhelming sewage smell I thought it was just one visit but I visited a week later and it still smelled like sewage Makes one wonder about the quality of the food and whether its safe to eat Tiger tea was basically 34 whole milk By the time you drink a third of it you realize you just bought half a liter of milk Coffees are okay Better than 711 or Dunkin Donuts not as good as Starbucks Both below good local coffee houses But so is the price Medium quality If they get rid of the Sewage Smell 4 stars Ill revisit this review in a month or so,negative,154,150-200,819,500-1000
The strawberry cheesecake was 710 good but not the best The brownie was 510 just average American pastry with too much sugar and not that much flavor Coffees were disappointing below average The place was disappointing as the place right in front was amazing,negative,44,25-50,269,<500
Wellthis is a very time consuming process one ice cream server moving at a minimum wage pace is a real buzz kill Either way at the cupcake counter or the ice cream counter its questionable Oh wait theres two lines huh No but ahwere together so can you serve us both The elder couple ahead of me gave up allowing me to advanceyea The server was pleasant and helpful no question but it was slow and saving on labor cost was evident for the day What was cool was the outside order door Think dumb waiter with a two way speaker whatever Your better off getting a popsicle at the liquor store around the corner food guymartin,negative,117,100-150,645,500-1000
I am a big fan of Bouchon Bakery in Yountville so I was excited to enjoy fresh pastries and baked goods during my visit to Las Vegas Unfortunately it was very disappointing The epi baguette was day old bread I can tell because I ate at Bouchon Bistro the same night and the bread was as good as I remembered The croissant was ok but it was definitely better in Yountville as well I expect better from a Thomas Keller place especially at the prices they charge,negative,87,75-100,467,<500
If you want amazing baked goods and MANY different optionsgo here We always stop in for a treat such as cookies cannolis brownies and gelato after dinner There are so many options it is almost difficult to choose So we tend to overorder and take goodies home for the next few days The cookies are light fluffy and super tasty and gelato is always spot on You can also grab sandwiches and pastas in the deli area Always good and always full of happy customers,positive,85,75-100,475,<500
For all the hype about milk bar and their cereal ice cream Im just not a great fan I ordered the cereal milk ice cream with cornflake topping and my boyfriend ordered the birthday cake ice cream with sprinkles Both were not satisfying at all I got some cookies to take home which were okay but definitely did not meet my expectations The cereal milk ice cream was not sweet which Im fine with but the cornflakes on it made it kinda salty which was not what I expected My boyfriends birthday cake soft was so sweet and disappointing he didnt even want to finish it I ended up mixing our two flavors because I didnt want to waste my money but it surprisingly tasted a little better when I combined the flavors but I wouldnt recommend trying the ice cream maybe just their baked goods Lastly the workers at this location are not friendly at all Maybe it was a bad day but they were just not having it when It was my turn to order,negative,177,150-200,943,500-1000
This place has the worst customer service The little blond child is so rude My wife was ordering an ice cream sand which and when the girl asked what type of ice cream shed like in She has to repeat herself and then the blonde kid said Do you speak English You wanna talk trash about your customers do it behind the closed glass jerks,negative,65,50-75,347,<500
Best ice cream EVERRRRR Love going to the location on 25th Cool vibe cool people  great quality ice cream made right in front of you My fav hands down,positive,30,25-50,157,<500
I loved this place So many unique flavors I wanted to try but ended up getting the honey lavender and my date got the mint chocolate chip one Bit were phenomenal We walked from an apartment downtown not sure if its a good thing or bad thing to be so close I may frequent this place too much The staff was really friendly Super cute little shop cant wait to go back,positive,72,50-75,380,<500
We have been back to Handels a few times with disappointing customer service on multiple occasions We waited in line for approximately 20 minutes on each trip My boys received Handels gift cards for their birthday We went over to get their birthday treats and they told me their gift card machine was broken Um ok Way to make that money Handels I coughed up the cash We returned again to use their gift cards I was told their was no money on the gift cards I coughed up the cash again If you read my previous review I got a different ice cream than I ordered This time I ordered a cup I got a cone Fool me twice wait three timeswe wont go back,negative,126,100-150,670,500-1000
Good food and very friendly staff Used a hooked deal for buy 1 get 1 50 off to buy milkshakes for my friend and I On my way out I accidentally dropped one and it splattered everywhere I went back into the store and the servers made me a 2nd one for free Was a damn good milkshake too,positive,59,50-75,290,<500
I was super excited to try cereal milk as Im a fan of Christina Tossis on Masterchef After trying it all I can say is that its weird but not weird in a bad way weird in a good way I got a small softserve and cereal milk tastes a little like malt Overall I enjoyed it and would get it again Didnt try any of the cookies but they looked tasty,positive,72,50-75,352,<500
I like this place has charm For me it is the second best place to get ice cream,positive,18,<50,82,<500
Been waiting for Masons Creamery brick and mortar to open all summerFinally it is here Had the pleasure of having Jesse serve us We walked in and he pretty much had samples ready for us to try He wanted us to try all off them haha and we pretty much did I settled with the Toasted Sesame and Salted Caramel which he recommended It was very flavorful I just want a gallon of the Toasted Sesame to take home There were about 16 flavors i think may be more Very unique flavors craft if you will Earl Grey Coconut Pandan All were full flavored Limited seating inside They do have outside seating with heaters which they were more than accommodating to turn on I will Definitely say that Ohio City is now an Ice Cream Battleground Cant wait to go back I will Definitely go out of my way to get Masons,positive,152,150-200,819,500-1000

Visiting from out of town read the reviews so decided to try it out since it closed a little late Got there just right before they closed a little expensive for 3 drinks and ice cream in a cup Drinks werent all that great even the ice cream didnt taste good Waste of my money I would say bcz didnt even drink half of my drink before I decided to toss it in the trash,negative,75,50-75,377,<500

The LV Strip strikes again with yet another celebrity chef let down I really enjoyed the chocolate dipped strawberries However my caramel cupcake and lemon shortbread tart Left a lot to be desired Can you say  no flavor No butter no moistness no freshness they could have come from a package on a store shelf Nothing to make my belly smile,negative,62,50-75,359,<500
My fiance and I were very excited to try out Sloans Ice Cream because we had never been and everything looked amazing We tried the luxury sampler which had these teeny tiny ice cream scoops for like 13 dollars What made it bad was that the guy scooping the ice cream kept going to the back and coming back and 3 of the flavors were not flavors we asked for His shake was 8 dollars and nothing special Neither was the ice cream It was just ok at a very expensive price,negative,92,75-100,473,<500
Terrible I got the milk quake and it is basically melted ice cream with chocolate and pretzel chunks I wish I could return it and get the soft serve I wont even think about it though because the guy at the register was definitely not about customer service I feel like I just threw away ten dollars,negative,57,50-75,304,<500

The best ice cream ever I highly recommend the flavor called Fat Elvis The customer service was also second to none We loved it and will be back soon,positive,29,25-50,153,<500
Never thought you could make bad ice cream but the people at this place managed it It has to be by FAR the worst ice creamsoft serve Ive had in my life The cheapest generic ice cream sandwich at a gas station is much much better Maybe I had a bad batch but based on the other reviews I think its just bad all the time If you enjoy flavorless not sweet  but extremely salty ice cream this is the place for you And then they go the other way and use ONLY sugar as an ingredient in everything else I have no idea why there is a line here,negative,111,100-150,551,500-1000
This incident happened around 930am Nov 29th Fri I ordered several bakery items together with a sandwich For the sandwich they requested whether to be toasted so I asked to do so I paid about 45 and they immediately gave a bag I just took the bag and came out the store and headed to my room at Palazzo After 5 mins walking I noticed that toasted sandwich might have been given to me together I checked the bag and it was missing This was fine since I also forgot to ask them So I headed back to the store I asked them whether it is ready and they mentioned that it is still being toasted It sounded strange since around 10mins already passed but I waited in front of the counter Then I noticed that they actually forgot to put it in the oven and they were finding a sandwich and putting it in the oven at that time We all make mistakes but I was expecting apology at this point The server didnt care about the wait or the mistake so I became angry So I requested for apology or any complimentary item The server refused I asked her whether I can talk to the manager She said there is no manager and he is upstairs I asked her to call him then but she said there is phone to call him which is I think is probably a lie She said just go upstairs to talk to him I wasnt happy about the attitude so I asked her name several times But she ignored my words So I had no option but to take a picture of her since I dont have her name This was inappropriate behavior so I have to apologize I didnt want to waste my time visiting upstairs so I just came back But I did have her name on the receipt HEATHER The manager of the store if you happen to read this review and if she denies about the incident then I should be able to send a picture of her This was very bad experience for me and I wouldnt visit this store again,negative,364,300- 500,1868,1500-2000
Instagram worthy You could probably ask for anything on the menu and it wouldnt be bad From donut ice cream sandwiches to over the top milkshakes and baka splits They also have actual food but I have not tried that yet If you have a sweet tooth give Ninetys a try,positive,51,50-75,274,<500
I visited this place this past Sunday night with my roommate because we were craving something sweet It was a little hard to find at first because the area isnt well lit but its behind Churchs chicken The place was pretty cute and had a lot customers in my opinion for a Sunday night 8 pm The lady was really nice and let us have samples to try I decided to get the sweet cream and passion fruit because of the sample When I got a cup it tasted more sweet cream than passion fruit It was still hit the spot I got a kids scoop and I thought the portion was generous My roommate got the Cookie Cup which is what the place is known for and she loved it The lady toasted the marshmallow in front of us Im not sure if Ill get it It seemed a little overpriced to me The place had lot of unique flavors that I would be willing to come back for though,positive,171,150-200,866,500-1000
I finally had the chance to try Sprinkles cupcake and there was not a long line like the ones in California Maybe it was my lucky day in Las Vegas On one side they sell cupcakes and the other side they sell ice cream I think its not bad that its 375 a single scoop but I rather try the cupcake first A cupcake cost 375 each which is a good and decent price for a dessert There are such a large variety of cupcakes but I had the red velvet and the vanilla Both were delicious Its located across from Ghiradelli Chocolates and you can see the high roller ferris wheel while enjoying your cupcake,positive,116,100-150,613,500-1000
I ordered a piece of birthday cake  cost with tax was over 15for dinner one slice The dessert was entirely too sweet It was sweet on sweet so that there was not real flavor just sugar I did enjoy the few crunchy crumbles in the layers but it was too little Also the cake was dry and fell apart making it difficult to eat with the stiff icing Man I have terrible luck at Vegas restaurants unless I leave the strip Wan wah ,negative,85,75-100,437,<500
This place is awesome and a must see for anyone visiting Charlotte The line can get a little long but only because its so popular Its always worth the wait and Ive never not been able to find a table Their staff is super friendly and the food and drinks are amazing,positive,52,50-75,273,<500
Staying at the Cosmopolitan in Vegas we stopped by for a treat The staff was very helpful and kind thats why Im giving it a two The funnel cake flavored soft serve was just horrible It went in the trash after the 2nd taste The three little cake balls we like someone rolled up some cake into a ball and iced it Clearly the cake items were made elsewhere as they were presented in sealed plastic I was really expecting more from this place But it just didnt deliver or compare to the level of the other restaurants we ate in the Cosmopolitan,negative,103,100-150,552,500-1000
Churn is a whimsical retrostyled creamery offering a grand selection of sundaes milkshakes and floats debuting flavors like Oh My Affogato Caramel Apple Pie Kickin Cherry Cola and How Now Brown Cow Churn is a reminiscent 1960s relic a soda shop candy store and ice cream parlor all at once yet with a modern adaptation,positive,55,50-75,333,<500

Pros Tastes like ice cream Cons Custard melts too quickly slow service incompetent staff My Advice Its worth a try but in the future Ill likely just opt for DQ We visited Jarlings last night for the first time after reading all the raving reviews It did not live up to all the fuss When we got there the line was to the door so we were about 6 or 7 people back at our window Even with 2 employees working that window it took a good 25 minutes or so to get to the front When we finally got a chance we ordered two single dip cups for the kids a single dip waffle cone for my fiance and a peanut butter fudge snowstorm their equivalent to DQs blizzard for me They guy that took our order clearly had no clue what he was doing After wandering around aimlessly for several minutes he finally passed our order on to someone else Even then it took forever for our order to be made Meanwhile the man who I presume was the manager just stood around watching and periodically yelling at customers in line to either come inside or go outside but to close the door When they finally got the order up to the window it was already melting Then the girl couldnt figure out how to work the cash register so it took quite a while to get my change back By the time I was able to get my order get my change and walk to the picnic tables outside there was melted custard dripping all over the place The ice cream or custard was good but not great and certainly not worth the price The snowstorm was smooth and had a rich peanut butter flavor to it On the other hand I ended up literally drinking it I wasnt impressed,negative,313,300- 500,1641,1500-2000
The cupcakes arent really cupcakes per se Instead they are cream and a little bit of cupcake below The chocolate chip cookie was hard but the ice cream was good Overall overpriced and not really worth checking out given the low quality,negative,42,25-50,242,<500
Brandon the owner was super friendly and the ice cream  made locally was fabulous Definitely a must,positive,18,<50,109,<500
I love the fact that they are open 24 hourswhen I went the staff was courteous as to be expected for a busy day I ordered a chai latte which was awesome and a croissant I dont like the neg reviews on here why go trying something out and then broadcasting how much you didnt like it Seems like a waste to me why not just go somewhere else Amelies keep doing what you are doing And as for the decor which has nothing to do with the food or service I like it it fits for the NoDa area,positive,100,75-100,496,<500
What a disappointment We had dinner in the Venetian and did some walking around and shopping I always develop a sweet tooth after dinner we saw the Carlos Bake Shop sign and knew that was our next stop It was across from Buddy Vs Restaurant The bake shop had a steady flow of customers Even though it was late there was still a decent selection in the cases We decided to get Vanilla cupcakes and a Creme Puff The prices are pretty much on par with most cupcake shopsbakeries in town The staff was pleasant and helpful The Creme Puff was very small and pretty average tasting had more whipped creme in than Bavarian creme On to the cupcakes Ugh I have never refused to finish my cupcake until now I LOVE cake but this was horrible Super dry with no taste did they forget to add the vanilla If a baker cant make a plain vanilla cake then you have no business being a baker The icing was pretty average but didnt help the cupcake one bit The other factors in this visit saved them from getting a 1 STAR review Skip this place if you are craving cake I will never go back,negative,205,200-250,1098,1000-1500
Very nice location on the 2nd floor of the Cosmopolitan hotel I was so happy to see the ad while at the Cosmo pool and even more so because I was actually contemplating paying 63 for a small cake to get shipped to me from New York I opted for the slice of confetti cake and boy was I disappointed 16 for a small slice of dry crumbly cake with no flavor I expected it to be stellar based on all the hype but maybe this was an old cake and I got a bad slice I would not go back but glad I got to experience milk in Vegas,negative,110,100-150,527,500-1000
Mitchells is such a bright spot in Ohio City Literally It is so bright and clean inside you cant help but smile The staff is incredibly friendly and just nice Such a nice change to be able to watch your ice cream being made The ice cream was delicious I went with the peanut butter chocolate chunk but it was hard to decide with all the fresh new seasonal flavors The only challenge is parking but all of Ohio City has the same challenge,positive,84,75-100,452,<500
Best bakery in Cleveland Cannolis are the absolute best Space is new and modern but maintains the old school charm of this classic Cleveland spot,positive,25,<50,148,<500
Ive been here a few times and for some reason always hope it will improve I love Cake Boss and admire Buddy and his teams attention to detail and love for baking but this bakery is a huge disappointment Im sure the original in Hoboken is incredible but dont waste your time here The cakes on display arent impressive and look like anyone made them at home The cupcakes are extremely dry and none of the pastries look fresh There are two lines one to order and one to pay and both are extremely unorganized I just went yesterday for the first time in two years and realized it hadnt gotten any better Hopefully they will eventually improve to the standard of what viewers expect when coming to this renowned bakery Until then I wont be back,negative,137,100-150,758,500-1000
I had never heard of Milk Bar until it was suggested to me on social media Im apparently easily influenced when it comes to food ads because I started thinking about their cake often I considered ordering it to be shipped from New York but Im actually glad I didnt spend the money because what I tried at the Vegas location wasnt the greatest I got a slice of birthday cake which was straight out of the fridge Do people like cold cake I really dislike it I debated letting it sit out for a while but decided to just go for it It tasted like week old refrigerated cake heavy and overly moist I did appreciate the icing though it melted in my mouth I wasnt able to eat more than 14 of the cake slice but I did eat a bunch of icing because it was pretty good Id love to try a fresh slice of their birthday cake For 14 I just expected so much more I left feeling pretty disappointed,negative,174,150-200,908,500-1000
My wife and I wanted to get some ice cream and so we hopped on to Yelp to find a place that we have not tried We came across Fatty Daddys and were convinced by the positive reviews so we decided to give it a try however we were not impressed We were actually disappointed It seems like most people go there for the macaroons and marshmallow ice cream sundaes Maybe those are satisfying but we just got some ice cream We both got a large cup with two different flavors The disappointing thing was that they gave us two small scoops and then charged us almost 16 Thats 4 per small scoop of ice cream I could have purchased a tub of ice cream for 4 Over priced and the flavor is mediocre,negative,134,100-150,705,500-1000
Milk Bar is Located in the Cosmopolitan on the Las Vegas Strip This is a small counter that serves some sort of soft serve cakes and cookies The thing that is popular are the Milk Quakes The Milk Quake has added broken dessert added to it Desserts are very EXPENSIVE A 6in Malted Milk Chocolate Cake will set you back 5600 The Milk Cake cost 1000 2017 pricing We love watching Master Chef and we like Pastry Chef Christina Tosi so we thought we wanted to try something from Milk Bar while we were here The person at the counter seemed helpful and we tried the Strawberry Corn Milk Quake It might not be Milk Quakes Fault but when we were there they dont provide a counter or any seats for you to enjoy your treat I note I have only been here once and have only tried the Strawberry Corn Milk Quake 1000 The frozen confection was served to me very melted and tasted sour like yogurt It didnt take like strawberries The milk quake also had lumps of broken corn bread in it Both of us thought this Milk Quake tasted HORRIBLE Two taste and the Milk Quake was in the trash The Milk Quake was high in price but turned out to be very low in Calories ,negative,221,200-250,1186,1000-1500
Came in on my hour long lunch break Ordered my food and waited in line for 30 minutes I watched 6 people that ordered after me get there food I asked for a refund and told them I had been waiting for over 20 minutes and they said we are busy and orders are in front of you I told them that if they would have at least acknowledged me that it would have been nice and the manager said well that wont work because they cook in the back I hope that this doesnt happen often but I will not be returning back here,negative,105,100-150,521,500-1000
Id had no issues with Sprinkles prior to todays incident On a whim my boss and I decided to satisfy a craving for ice cream by grabbing sundaes at Sprinkles All was well we had no qualms about walking down a block from our Stripcentric workplace to grab a snack for ourselves and another member of the staff Attached is a photo of the salty caramel ice cream with the black and white cupcake top and to the left is the hair I found inside of my treat I write this after having thrown up upon the discovery of this hair and in between gags as I can still smell the sugary confection emanating from our bathroom and the trash can Reevaluate your health code if you need a refresher Otherwise reevaluate your staff Id run back down there to demand a refund and file a personal complaint however unlike Sprinkles employees I actually take my job seriously Heres hoping SNHD comes across this notice and gets you to correcting the establishments policy and procedure before this happens again,negative,179,150-200,1011,1000-1500
Friendly staff Great lobster tails No cannolis for the weekend Today is monday and still no cannolis were avaliable  I was very disappointed Nothing like the actual bakery you see in the TV show on TLC I will not be returning back a huge disappointment Especially when I saw regular bread on display that you can buy at any local bakery at least here in california I expected so much from buddys bakery I am a huge fan but truly not a 5 star rating place,negative,87,75-100,474,<500

Im disappointed Cupcakes and cheesecake were awful Not worth waiting in a long line,negative,14,<50,91,<500
Honestly I dont understand the hype at all We went with a large group and had a good selection of all donuts They were comparable to grocery store donuts The more simple donuts were dry and almost seemed stale and the creative flavors were pretty gaggy The saving grace was the cold brew iced coffee that was very good Unfortunately we were going for the donuts not the coffee Not impressed,negative,71,50-75,401,<500
The croissants and muffins are top notch with the Ham Gruyere and Cheesecake Chocolate Chip Muffin being personal standouts Theres a neat chalkboard calendar on the wall that details when theyll be baking up various specialty bread Plan accordingly,positive,39,25-50,253,<500

I found this bakery highly overrated We bought three items and each was beyond stale Gave an extra as they refunded our money with no hesitation They had to realize how stale they were when we bought them,negative,38,25-50,208,<500
You wait for hours because the service is slow They dont mange the lines that well so people sneak in I waited only because I wanted a cannoli and at noon when I entered they were out If they are so popular they should bake more or at least post a sign saying they are out I was very excited and now Im just disappointed When I watched the show they seem like a nice family run place now its clearly all about the money Good places like this loose credibility when they expand just to make money,negative,98,75-100,505,500-1000
Yikes You expect a milkshake shop to have some good flavors Nope Mostly cereal milk NO ONE EVER DRANK CEREAL MILK AND THOUGHT you know the milk is the best part and a few other flavors Theyre all awful Theyll all cost you 10 and youre better off getting a McFlurry across the street or spend a little more and go to Holsteins I got the crack pie my friends got three different cereal flavors and we all tried all of them Half of us threw them away after a few bites I finished mine mostly out of spite and optimism Side note if youve been to Milk in LA I havent apparently its not the same,negative,117,100-150,620,500-1000
I love this place I always bring visitors havent had a bad experience yet aside from they should have more people working now that its getting more popular Macaroons are thin and chewy especially when combined with the heat of marshmallow You are able to test the ice cream flavors theyre unique and I thought to be very creamy and delicious Definitely worth going to get the whole shabang Kind of a weird hidden spot Im not sure how people would know about this place aside from word of mouth They definitely deserve a better location,positive,96,75-100,550,500-1000
Bon Appetit named Sweet Republic a Top 10 Ice Cream Shop so when I was in Phoenix I went out of my way to pay them a visit Thankfully not too far out of my way I had high expectations because of all the accolades bestowed on this shop by foodies in the know My first impression was not good Its located in a strip mall with rickety outdoor tables and chairs situated in between two trash cans The appearance does improve once you get in the front door Its decorated nicely and there were a couple teenagers at a table playing board games they got from the stash of games at the back of the shop It had a nice vibe They rotate their flavors of ice cream and sorbet so you get what you get Too bad the menu on the wall didnt match what was in the cases I was disappointed they didnt have a chocolate peanut butter cup flavor Instead they had Peanut Butter Chip which was churned peanuts with chocolate flakes Nothing else looked appealing to me so thats what I ordered The texture was weird kind of icy not creamy There were little pieces of peanuts that didnt help matters and the teensy flakes of dark chocolate were not abundant enough to add to the flavor It was altogether odd My sister had lemon sorbet and her review was Meh We couldnt really figure out what was so great about this place,negative,248,200-250,1329,1000-1500
I submitted a wedding inquiry with Hopscotch at the beginning of May and received a response relatively quickly from the owner Kaya Tate After looking over the website and weighing my options I sent Kaya a response letting her know that I would like to secure an order and schedule a tasting I paid my deposit on May 31st One June 24th I asked her in an email about the tasting as I had not heard from her since I paid my deposit She didnt answer me until July 15th and her response was that she would get with me to set up an appointment once her shop was finally open Her shop opened in July and I eagerly waited for a call On August 26th I had to email her again to see if we could finally set up a tasting appointment She didnt answer until September 5th to ask what flavors I was interested in and said that there wouldnt be an appointment but simply a tasting box that I would pick up from the store It was implied that we would have a physical meeting and that I would have the opportunity to try the cupcakes and pick my favorites but now I only had the choice to pick three cupcakes for a tasting box and hope that they were good I planned on getting three flavors of cupcakes for my wedding reception and so only choosing three to try was very limiting By September 20th I still hadnt heard anything from Kaya so I went to the shop to see if I could get any further with her in person At this point my wedding was about two months away and I couldnt afford to wait around several weeks between emails anymore I asked the woman at the counter about the tasting box that Kaya had mentioned and she told me that they dont do tasting boxes and that I would have to purchase the cupcakes that I wanted to try I put a deposit down and was purchasing 144 cupcakes for my event already now my taste testing appointment turned taste test box with three options had been downgraded again to buying the cupcakes that I wanted to taste individually I told her which flavors that I wanted to try and gave her my phone number so that she could call me when the flavors that I wanted to try were available in the case for sale in the shop I left and called my fiancÃ to discuss the situation who then called Hopscotch to speak to Kaya herself She was told that Kaya was busy and that they only opened about 7 weeks ago Shortly after their phone call I received an email from Kaya stating that there would be a taste test box with my three flavors ready on September 27th I arrived to pick up the box and when I opened it there were only two cupcakes inside I asked the woman behind the counter where the third cupcake was and her response was that they were out of strawberries and that there was nothing that they could do I asked if I could go to the store and buy her some strawberries and explained that my wedding was less than a month and a half away and that we had started this process clear back in May I then asked to speak to Kaya I was told that she was busy in the back and that she couldnt come speak with me I left the box of two cupcakes and said that I would email Kaya I then emailed Kaya requesting my deposit back as we had spent four months getting nowhere Less than five minutes after I sent that email she had already refunded my deposit which was the fastest correspondence that I had gotten out of Kaya since we spoke in May There was no further communication she was just as done with me as I was with her The deposit has now made it into my bank account leaving me less than a month to find and coordinate with another bakery for my wedding This place is adorable and their treats are tasty but they are not capable of handling a wedding or any other large event If they cant make three cupcakes in four whole months they are certainly not capable of making 144 cupcakes for one days event,negative,742,500+,3873,2000+

Service is fast friendly staff and just a great bakery cafe place I always buy their taro bread and their loaf Theyre really good My only complain is that 2 hours before closing their bread stocks are almost empty So make sure you go before 7pm otherwise youd be wasting your gas going there and then finding out that theres nothing left on the shelf because theyre sold out,positive,69,50-75,387,<500

The owner Brandon invited me back for a second visit after I left a review not being a fan of the Fat Elvis flavor He explained that it is a very polarizing flavor love or hate He also said that customers can ask to try every and any flavor Feel free to ask for a sample of every flavor no judgement He wants his establishment to be different than some other ice cream shops that act like its a burden to sample more than 1 flavor Their menu has some flavors that stay every day and some that rotate so each time you go there will be different flavors to try Today I tried 6 flavors Straight Up Strawberry the best plain strawberry ice cream Ive ever had Im not usually a fruity ice cream type of person but I wanted to venture out Worth it Very fresh Lemon Blueberry Sorbet not a big sorbet fan but this was amazing Very tangy and sweet at the same time Tasted like a frozen lemonade Very soft the spoon goes right through it Bourbon Caramel Toffee Crunch this is a great choice is you want something with texture The bourbon and caramel makes a great sweet but interesting flavor This one is worth a sample at least some may not like the bourbon but I do Honey Lavender one of my top 2 I just love honey lavender and its a hard flavor to get right This one tasted very natural Floral and sweet perfection Sweet Cream and Honey very subtle sweetness This one would probably be loved by EVERYONE Thai Tea one of my top 2 Thai tea ice cream is rare to find and Ive only seen it a few times This one was so amazing They source real authentic tea leaves and use it in their ice cream you can see the leaves in the ice cream No artificial flavors here This one is definitely a love it or hate it flavor but its my favorite It tastes just like a Thai tea drink but in solid form Brandon is a great business owner and really cares about the experience He uses REAL INGREDIENTS and many are sourced locally If you ever have a bad experience here feel free to reach out to him he will make it right Im now a huge fan of this establishment The customer service from every employee I met was amazing The ice cream is award winning their ice cream chef competes in ice cream convention competitions No wonder this place is 55,positive,430,300- 500,2281,2000+
Im obsessed with Milk Bar and this one is amazing The counter staff gave us samples of the soft serve to try and they were so large we barely wanted to pick one to order anymore Earthquakes are amazing and boozy shakes are pretty boozy Everything else is standardMilkBaramazing if youve had it before They run out of stuff so if you want something in particular and its super popular cornflake or compost cookies for example go early to get it,positive,81,75-100,463,<500

Been there many times and finally figured out this store is not very honest afterall Went to purchase the lava cake which was advertised as 1 Americano but it is actually 460 And you have to pay an extra 1 if you would like the Americano coffee with it Also on the app it says FREE 2 coffee but the lady at the store told me the Free indicates that no points are required to exchange for the item So the coffee is still 2 We also sat in the bakery store for a while to enjoy our coffee to find out that the staff would called out fresh bread every 2 to 3 minutes The bread tray was actually taken out from the display shelf with leftover bread in it and will come out TOGETHER with other so called fresh bread from the other shelf inside And they keep doing this every 2 to 3 minutes Really Are they actually freshly made The bread there is not cheap at all Most of them are 150 to 170 each for a regular bread The stores advertisement is misleading and confusing It is almost a bait and switch It made you wait in the long line for a long time and finally realized you are not getting a deal afterall,negative,219,200-250,1138,1000-1500
I was so excited to finally get to the Linq Promenade to try a Sprinkles cupcake and I was sadly disappointed The cupcakes are super size Small and the flavor was very bland We ordered a Chocolate Marshmallow and a standard Vanilla with sprinklesThe cake was pretty dry and had hardly any flavor The frosting for the vanilla one was quite funkymonkeynot sure what it was hard and not like frosting at all And I will add the price Not worth it at all 375 for a tiny tiny cupcake No thanks Girls were nice in the store I guess that is the positive part of my experience there Not what I was expecting at all very sad But hey it was a beautiful night for a stroll at The Linq,negative,131,100-150,697,500-1000

The best brownies I have ever had in my entire life are found at Carlos Bakery I was in Morrisville NJ on a business trip and visited Carlos there I bought one brownie and took it on the airplane with me Midflight I decided to eat it I couldnt believe how perfectly delicious it was  the right balance of walnuts to the brownie and frosted I love all of those combinations The brownie was so good that I wished I had bought a couple more to take home So  when I was driving from Southern California to Utah recently I stopped at the Venetian  walked all over that place to find Carlos Stood in line for half an hour and bought 6 brownies for the rest of my trip I will never miss the opportunity to stop into Carlos for a brownie Next time I have to try an eclair,positive,153,150-200,790,500-1000
I recently move back to Charlotte from Atlanta for grad school and was happy that they had an Amelies here but It must be the ambience and the fact that they open 24hrs that keeps me coming here because honestly the food is overpriced overrated and most importantly the INTERNET NEVER WORKS when Im hereEVER i have to put my hotspot on Im done coming here I am a big fan of coffee shops I come here to do homework because when i stay home i dont get as much work done as i will at a coffee shop but yesterday was my last time coming here and spending over 15 for a drink and small pastries that looks like sample sizes I was taking an exam and the internet failed on me WTF this is my first ever review Get it together,negative,143,100-150,742,500-1000
I have to say coming from Ohio where I know where the original Handles originated I am apalled at the fact I was asked if I had a child present with me when I ordered a child sized cone of vanilla ice cream with the rest of my order I was taking my order for my family home and because I didnt have a child present with me I was told they could not sell me a child size cone of vanilla ice cream Riley was our cashier Im sure this is not her fault but a result of being told she could not since she repeated how she could not sell us the child size cone if our child was not there I would appreciate if I am a paying customer and I am ordering from a menu you advertise with options that I can choose from that you not embarrass me nor make me feel inadequate while making my purchase We asked for a specific size for a specific reason Nothing was asked for free and was part of a full order to go I am strongly debating to return to this establishment which was one of our favorites here in Vegas that made us feel closer to home I was surprised I still ate my ice cream with how disturbed I was I work in the food industry and have never seen this type of service to a customer Especially from a Handles,negative,246,200-250,1225,1000-1500
Cute inside and great 2 ladies working There isnt much room at the counter and there were some idiots there either drunk or had never been to an ice cream place They kept milling around and not trying anything but staring at the ice cream I walked a long way and 1 flavor was melted and no good The flavors I got Sloans dark chocolate and another chocolate Hodge podge flavor Good but not better than Ben and Jerrys and not really creative The strawberry was good but kinda melted Way over priced I should have known because it had almost no smell I love the smell of fresh waffle cones and cooling fudge They had both but no smell,negative,120,100-150,646,500-1000

I went to the West Side Market stood patiently in line got a cold unfriendly feeling from the staff then the crepes were poured and their seemed to be words exchanged with the coffee place next door about the music they were playing so the crepe worker climbed up on a step stool and fiddled with the stereo for a good 34 minutes while our crepes were turning to stone on the griddle and mind you there must have been at least 810 people in this line yet to be waited on She then proceeded to continue to prepare the brittle WAY OVER DONE crepe as if nothing were wrong with it and serve it to me I could not believe it She must have known it was beyond repair as she had trouble even getting it to fold to put it in its wrapper Such rude unprofessionalism should not be tolerated but the owners The crepes arent cheap and I really should have not accepted it but I had already paid and tipped and I didnt want to hold up the line any longer than it had already been held up As predicted it was brittle and awful Needless to say I will NEVER spend my hard earned money or my time here again Not worth it,negative,218,200-250,1117,1000-1500

This place is an overpriced mess The items look great but no flavor dry and mass produced and just terribly disappointing There was a long line when we got there which didnt detour us as because we can wait for good treats But then 50 later sadly NOTHING was worth more than two bites We tried several items and ALL disappointing Im sad about time wasted Sad about empty flavorless calories Mostly sad about being tricked out of 50 by this famous bakery that produces this junk,negative,87,75-100,495,<500
Lets start with the fact that this place is located in the druggy addicted to crack section in downtown Las Vegas Wife and kids stayed in the car while I got out to go make my purchase I bought their famous crÃme brÃlÃe donut Paid 9 for three of them For that price I thought I would get the best donut Ive eaten in my life What I did get is the cheat you for your money version of a donut The donut should be called empty oily bread with sugar top BrÃlÃe  If it wasnt for the fact I had to run away from that area to not get robbed or stabbed on the way to the car I wouldve returned to give them back the crap I bought Go to Dunkin Donuts you get the same crap for half the price,negative,144,100-150,708,500-1000

To quote a song from the play Anne of Green Gables Ice cream is marvelous and mysterious Ice cream can make you feel so delirious YES it can and I have been an ice cream fanatic my whole life Sweet Republic only rates two stars from me and I am scratching the head at some of these raves reviews I was quite turned off by my first visit there earlier this year and the same thing happened when I tried the 16th Street location Chacun a son gout and all that but every one knows ICE cream is mean to be served FROZEN One should be able to lick it without the whole dissolving into soup within 30 seconds My advice to this place is stop trying to create the worlds most esoteric flavor combos and for the love of Pete PLEASE buy a better freezer I fully expected for the 4 dollar something single cone to start dripping when I got outside back into the desert heat but not as it is handed to me over the counter Wont be back,negative,182,150-200,947,500-1000

I was really disappointed with my visit to Melt Looking at the pictures I was so excited to give it a try but with the change in location it really is just a stand outside a coffee shop and bar It looked as though the number of flavors had greatly decreased as well While I was excited to try the cerealflavored ice cream I did not enjoy the cereal that was mixed in as it was soggy and did not add a textural crunch that I would have liked In addition the ice cream was icy and not creamy they chose the wrong word to focus on The concept is cute to serve the ice cream in a takeout carton but the quality isnt what I expected With all my complaints with the ice cream it was also pricey so I would not recommend this place for ice cream,negative,149,100-150,756,500-1000

I used to always watch and love the Cake Boss show and I was so excited to learn that Carlos Bakery is open in Vegas Rushing to get there as quickly as I can and with my anticipation to try their pastries I took that one bite from one of their cupcakesI was so disappointed You could immediately taste the cannola oil they use instead of butter and the cake itself too is dry and old itseven worse than the prepacked or vending machine type So I gave another try to take a bite from one of their cannoli Another disappointment I wonder if Carlos pastry chef is managing quality control or they are just catering their products to the regular mass without considering the authenticity of the real Italian Cannoli Overall its just the hype that makes people get inline to try their pastries and I will never come back nor recommend Carlos Bakery,negative,155,150-200,861,500-1000

Over a short period of time this place has gone to the dogs Napoleons and other butter cream pastries are now frozen as a matter of course Beverage selection is poor and badly made coffee is accepted Hipsters seem to accept the off hand service and lack of attention to detail as a badge of honor Sadly the hype has done Amelies a great disservice I hope they can remedy it I used to love the place,negative,77,75-100,405,<500
I grew up eating Honey Hut Ice Cream and for my high school years was honored to scoop up cones in blue and red Polos That being said I think that my love HH Ice Cream is completely unbiased and totally true to the customer service and amazing taste Best tip to know is that a single scoop is two scoops and a double is four You can always mix two flavors and to be honest its easiest to eat in a cup but if you prefer the crunch get a cone in a cup Have a big group or want to try yourself out for man vs food get the destroyer It is basically Godzillas banana split and unless you can eat it fast will turn into soup on a hot summer day I remember coming to Honey Hut on the last day of school every year with my friends and devouring the destroyer in minutes My favorite creation is honey pecan with red raspberries and hot Carmel,positive,169,150-200,844,500-1000
It is hard to appropriately describe what its like to walk into Ameliesits like Alice in Wonderland meets Paris meets Grandmas house meets a garden party The food is amazing We had coffee and dessert we tried several then we took some pastries back to our hotel for breakfast It is a wonderful place to check out while in Charlotte,positive,60,50-75,345,<500
The infamous Bouchon Bakery Finally I got to try it We walked around the corner and there it was I was pretty disappointed in the size its a mini kiosk built under the escalator The selection was slim There was absolutely no one in sight I got the Pistachio and Espresso Macaroon They were good in size I enjoyed the fact that they were not TOO sweet there was a lot of flavor It was pretty pricey for one macaroonI wish they had a wider selection of pasteries,positive,88,75-100,478,<500
Anyone that gives Jarlings Custard Cup below a 5 star rating is functionally insane or they were huffing spray paint in the preceding 5 hours before enjoying their tasty treats Seriously Jarlings is that good To those drawing similarities between their product and ice cream Youre gastronomically challenged Yes they are both cold and dairy based but it ends there Their custard is obviously so much denser and creamier than ice cream Ice cream by process has to have a bunch of air stirred into it The only knock on the Jarling organization is that they dont want to franchise it or distribute the secret process Jarlings inc world wide could have an IPO greater than Googles ,positive,118,100-150,694,500-1000
Such a great little spot to enjoy ice cream out on their lit up patio I wanted to show my mom and brother how Phoenix does ice cream and glad I brought them here Ended up enjoying our Lemongrass Poppyseed and Fruity Pebbles ice cream out front at 11pm in the warm Phoenix night The place served up quick ice cream scoops and amused my family with their Chinese takeout boxes and fortune cookie garnish The ice cream was creamy had spot on flavors and Melts patio is lovely They serve up candies and other kinds of snacks here as well Street parking is easy and theres a couple of great places nearby like Jobot and Songbird Cafe,positive,118,100-150,640,500-1000
This bakery reminds me of and tastes just like my moms homemade treats The baked goods are freshly made with home town ingredients and always taste delicious My favorites are the chocolate croissants and their challah bread The staff always makes me feel like family and are incredibly helpful I cant say enough good things about Batch,positive,57,50-75,342,<500

Disappointed Got there at 8 so I wouldnt have a long wait They opened 20 minutes late and I only went there for a cannoli and cheese cake and they didnt even have any,negative,34,25-50,171,<500
This place was on our way and dang it I wanted a fritter So we stopped Luckily the line was short Among the usual flavors glazed and cake etchere was a great selection of different flavors like the Creme brÃlÃe  French toast and grilled cheese donuts I got my fritter a chocolate bar cake donut and a couple other flavors All were sweet and looked good but ended up being pretty dry The fritter seemed over fried especially the edges,negative,81,75-100,449,<500
The original the wonderful the delicious Amelies of NoDa This place has been open since 2008 and its no surprise that they have thrived in the years since The outstanding quality of their food paired with top notch customer service has turned them into somewhat of a confectionery juggernaut around the Queen City Amelies now operates six total shops with four in Charlotte NC one in Rock Hill SC and one in Atlanta GA I have personally visited three of the six locations and can attest to them maintaining their standards on all fronts A Macaron in NoDa is going to taste exactly the same as a Macaron in Park Rd Speaking of Macarons those are just one of dozens if not hundreds of options to choose from Cakes pies tarts puffs cookies croissants muffins breads If it can be baked they probably have it Some of my personal favorites are the Chocolate Petite Gateau the Twice Baked Almond Croissant the Pecan Tartlet and the Sea Salted Caramel Brownie I would normally go through and try to describe to you what flavors and textures made each of these items so good but youre really just better off trying them yourself Imagine a delicious treat you fancy Got it pictured Now head on over to Amelies Do they have it Probably and if so I would bet its at least as good if not better than the one youd get from whatever place you imagined They really are that good They are a cafe as well as a bakery so they have an assortment of fresh made savory fair as well though I admittedly have only tried the sweet stuff I have heard good things from friends though Amelies is usually a special occasion dessert stop for me Their per item prices arent really going to break your bank but if you decide you want to bring home a whole box of goodies for the family and friends it can get a little expensive A Macaron is just over 2 and a Petite Gateau is just under 6 to give a frame of reference Quality does come at a price but Im happy to pay it I could sit here and tell you about Amelies all day The unique decor at each location the splendid treats of all shapes and sizes the fact that they are open late with the original location being open 247365 You need to decide for yourself if Im just rambling or if they really are as good as I claim I have never had a bad experience at one of their shops with the biggest downside being an occasional line during peak hours I hope my words are enough to at least pique your interest but Amelies is something best experienced in person The next time you visit eat a croissant for me,positive,477,300- 500,2599,2000+
Absolutely amazing Super pricey but definitely worth it for the pastries Food good but for real Italian food Ive had better for the price Great for a romantic dinner with a great view though,positive,34,25-50,196,<500
No famous lobster tails for a WEEK Super disappointing I imagine they are in for a rough week considering everyone that walks in specifically asks for the lobster tails,negative,29,25-50,172,<500
The cake was very dry and lacked notable flavor I typically dont review but I was really craving a good slice of cake that day and drove pretty far with high hopes Perhaps the cake is best when eaten with coffee or tea but certainly not for a moist cake fix,negative,51,50-75,262,<500
Best Macarons ever,positive,3,<50,19,<500
I went here every day when I was in vegas because its so yummy They even offer samples if you cant decide Their crack pie milk quake was my favorite Highly recommend Superb customer service,positive,35,25-50,196,<500
Excellent spot for cupcakes cookies and ice cream Reasonable prices and everything is very tasty Good gluten free choices as well I very much enjoyed this gem,positive,27,25-50,163,<500
Only popped in to find hot chocolate Found the staff extremely rude store is small not very wheelchair friendly,negative,19,<50,114,<500
So disappointing Love Cake Boss and was excited to try some pastries We tried a few different items The seven layer cookie I know them as rainbow cookies in NY was very average Tried a pecan snowball cookie So dry And so bland Hubs and I each got beautiful sugar cookies with sprinkles They looked great Once again bland Zero flavor With so many options in Vegas you are better off going elsewhere for sweets The only good thingtheir prices are not bad especially for Vegas,negative,86,75-100,501,500-1000
demoted to 4 stars Consistency and quality control is lacking The technique is not as good as madison sourdough down the street but batch has more offerings Wish they were more creativeadventurous in putting out new products Staple items like quiche and morning bun are very good,positive,47,25-50,287,<500
I knew the reviews were pretty bad for this place but I was at the Linq for my first time ever and I had to check out the cupcake ATM I was surprised there was no line on a Saturday night walking up to Sprinkles The store is small one side is cupcakes only and the other side is just ice cream I chose the triple cinnamon cupcake because the description sounded good A lightly spiced buttermilk cupcake topped with cinnamon cream cheese frosting and dusted with cinnamon sugar yum The actual cupcake left something to be desired The cupcake was dry and flavorless For something that is supposed to have triple cinnamon I barely tasted any at all I love cream cheese frosting but this one was bland How can a cupcake that sounds so yummy be a total fail My friend got a double scoop of chocolate fudge almond ice cream that was pretty tasty I decided to get a kids cup of the Captain Crunch ice cream and it was good but I am glad I got a kids cup The employees were friendly but I dont understand their ordering process It is quite silly to take my name when I am the only patron in there and the same girl walk over to the other side of the counter and put together my order and collect payment Its also weird that you cant get cupcakes from the ice cream side and vice versa A sign would be a nice indicator of that so people dont get confused I wouldnt come back here again but it was definitely cool to see an ATM that dispenses cupcakes,negative,279,250-300,1479,1000-1500
i did not like this place at all the food was okay but i can make better stuff at my house  The staff was very rude and the bathroom was dirty and had no towels,negative,36,25-50,161,<500
What a really nice bakery right outside the Venetian and you dont have to go inside the casino as it is located right on the LV strip We went here twice on our trip and both times they really had great pastry items I would go back to try for more I tried the Kouign Amman and the fruit croissant The Kouign Amman was flaky and was something Ive never tried before but was one of my favorites after I had it The fruit croissant was fresh tasting and had very good flavor The mochas we had were very good too and definitely had a good amount of caffeine If coming to Vegas the next time I would surely come here again as they have a good variety to choose from and everything looks fresh and tasty They do have seating but it is only outside and in the mornings we came it was just too cold and windy,positive,159,150-200,810,500-1000
I always wanted to go to the Amelies since I study French and Im obsessed with French culture and cuisineLast year I went to study abroad in France and let me tell you that Amelies is a bakery but definitely not FRENCH bakery Have you ever had french macarons or napoleon cake Their products may look like the original French but they are not I went there today specifically to treat my bf and myself with nice French deserts At first I couldnt even bite the macaron thats how hard it was it was not fresh had weird coloring for example pistachio macaron usually has mint color or light green Here is was toxic bright green and didnt have the same taste The food did not smell nice it had some kind of artificial smell Moreover the cake itself was not macaron at all it only looked like one The chocolate macaron was simply a sticky kind of brownie instead of two pieces of meringue with soft ganache inside The napoleon was made from frozen parts of cream and only thin slice of pastry and basically looked and tasted like cheap frozen pies that you can buy from Bilo or Harris teetereven groceries have better frozen cakes Napoleon is not even supposed to be frozen It tasted like an icecream and felt like an icecream I dont mind icecream at all but they false advertised it as a regular napoleon cake Ive tried several deserts and returned them and fortunately cashier issued me a refund However I will not come back If you want to try traditional macarons go to the Earth Fare or Cafe Monte PS the interior is nice  a la francais but you can put little copies of Eiffel Tower everywhere and it still not going to make it a French cafepatisserierestaurant if the food served there is not French and not fresh The personnel had no idea about what they were selling the guy whom I questioned had to go to the backdoor 4 times to answer do they use traditional recipes or not and if the pastry they sell was made according to the French recipes,negative,362,300- 500,2011,2000+
On a recent trip to Vegas I was so excited to take my mother to Carlos Bakery I must say we were underwhelmed to say the least Of the five employees working we noted not a single smile At best they seemed bored and uninterested That was disappointing Then there was the food We ordered a brownie red velvet cupcake and a cannoli They didnt even have regular cannoli so we got a chocolate chip cannoli Not a single dessert impressed They were all just average We bought cupcakes from the grocery store bakery a few days later that we all agreed were better Sad sad experience Maybe the Cake Boss has overextended himself   Is quantity having a negative impact on quality,negative,124,100-150,698,500-1000
Cool place Good food Really bad service Weve been here 6  8 times and weve never experienced even decent service We keep going back because we really like the atmosphere and the food  but I think were done giving it more chances The employees behind the counter all seem completely miserable to be working there and attitudes towards customers reflect that During our most recent visit I walked out after standing and waiting at the drink counter for 5 minutes for a drink refill  and there were 2 people working this area with no other customers They were just completely oblivious,negative,104,100-150,602,500-1000
Visited this place 1015 in the afternoon It was not too busy but it still took a while to be helped Since I had a party of four I let an older lady go ahead of us in the line because it knew it would take them awhile to help her I waited for what seemed like 10 mins A gentleman in a bright colored shirt came in behind us After the older lady ordered and went to pay my children and I went up to the counter Lady in a white shirt all of the other workers were in red shirts proceeded to look at us then looked over my shoulder and asked the gentleman behind me if he had been helped It took me by surprise at first all she had to do was confirm with me that we were next in line Since she felt like we skipped this guy she went out of her way to apologize to him and thank him several times for his patience and even got another worker to stop what she was doing to help him first WTH We were waiting long before he came in She totally rubbed me the wrong way and I will never visit this place again I would have said something to her but my kids would have been upset so I let it go at the time Oh yeah the ice cream wasnt worth it My kids were not impressed,negative,245,200-250,1193,1000-1500
I had the ice cream a year ago and got turned off by the counter service They were measuiring out smallmedium size by weight on a scale I have never had that experience before in NYC or Scottsdale I forgot how the ice cream tasted Im happy to hear that they are doing well and I wish them the best,negative,60,50-75,304,<500

Their apple fritter was a complete fail No flavor no sweetness nothing special about it Apple fritters are my absolute favorite donut so Im very let down by theirs On a positive note the Homer donut was amazing  Very soft very sweet a complete 10 out of 10 score Also amazing is their Strawberry Cheesecake donut The perfect amount of filling and also very soft donut oooo sooo yummy I wouldnt mind if they added more graham cracker crumbs on top Ive never had a bad Chai Latte so I was very pleased by theirs My junk food sidekicks ordered the following Creme BrÃlÃe maple bacon bar triple chocolate threat bacon cinnamon roll and the caramel latte donuts No complaints from them Apparently the bacon cinnamon rolls was out of this world delicious,positive,134,100-150,783,500-1000
Move on to something better and lighter I tried the birthday cake shake since the server told its the most popular item they sell and it was not remotely good The 10 price tag for the shake also didnt help its cause,negative,42,25-50,221,<500
Villanis is the BEST bakery in Charlotte The Italian Cream Cake and the chocolate chip cookies are incredible The cookies are the aid of biscuits so be prepared to eat just one  well maybe not Theyre that good Even though I havent tried the cheesecake yet there are many options to choose from If youre a cheesecake lover I recommend you follow Villanis on social media to check out the daily selections because they do go fast Im not a fan of macaroons but I do find that Villanis offers a huge selection and a lot of people like them Go to Villanis RUN dont walk You wont be disappointed And if you are call me and Ill take them off your hands,positive,124,100-150,680,500-1000
I went back in June on a Sunday afternoon to Carlos bake shop and no lines at all I waited with my brother and sister in line for a few minutes until someone helped us Too much to choose from cannoli cupcakes and cookies Next we lined up at the cashier to pay our items and the line wasnt long at all They make the best Italian cookies and cannoli with fresh cream and good crunch Lots of people linger to looky loo or just waiting for their orders Its fun to watch the bakers frost the tray of cupcakes or making cookies I will definitely go back again,positive,109,100-150,565,500-1000
The best tiramisu and gelato in town Light dinners range from 710 dollars The paninis are fabulous and so are the Cavetelli and meatball You enter and take a ticket If there are people blocking the doorway with deer in the headlight expression yell  excuse me and then push your way in Very clean and laid back atmosphere Prestis is mostly known as a bakery Its an after dinner treat in Little Italy Great sidewalk cafe seating as well as seating indoors Silverware and cold water are self serve as are the sodas and other beverages Great place to take a date after dinner I prefer the Stracciatella ice cream but the spumoni is good too The lunch specials are hit or miss and Ive had one served ice cold No Im not kidding Stick to dessert anx youll be fine,positive,142,100-150,780,500-1000
I love the OG location of Mitchells Its spacious and you can see the workers make the ice cream from the glass window I feel like Mitchells is such a Cleveland staple and is so beloved by many of the locals You have to come here at least once if youre visiting,positive,52,50-75,269,<500
Seriously amazing ice cream Almost better than what I hadat Redding station in PA Im thrilled they reopened this place because its a Phoenix gem Tried the salted caramel cashew blew my mind Also had the burgundy cherry they dont skimp on mixins or on their quality All the employees are wonderful and carefully prepare your treat even making you a fresh waffle cone when ordered The managerowner treated me like a queen piling the ice cream in my fresh cone topping it with real whip cream and a cherry 425 for this Yup it was cheaper than thrifty ice cream brand and 10x better Ill be back,positive,108,100-150,619,500-1000
Anytime a nonvegan bakery or dessert shop offers more than just one or two options I get very excited So I was exuberant when I saw the vegan options available here After much debate I settled on the Black Cherry Soy It was a rich and creamy dessert I was very impressed On another visit I tried their vegan Cookies and Cream It was good but it wasnt as creamy as the Black Cherry They also have some sorbet flavors but Ive never tried them FYI Their waffles cones are vegan this was confirmed by the ownermanager I dont recall which title she held Remember that fun fact because some of the workers dont know that and will tell you that the cones arent vegan My only complaint is that parking can be a pain in this area You may have to circle the area several times before you find a spot,positive,152,150-200,814,500-1000

The weekend I moved to Charlotte my buddy and I decided to get some brunch and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and deliciousness of what is on offer here It was early but there was already a line forming which is a testament to how popular the place is We ordered a few sandwiches some coffee and some pastries and all of them were fantastic and the decor positively compliments the food Would highly recommend this place,positive,78,75-100,436,<500
After willing to try this place for a long time I finally tried it and decided that the long line wasnt really worth it at all First of all the food and customer service looked like a big joke I ordered a crumb cake and a lobster tail which both looked dry Second of all the lack of organization in the tiny shop was ridiculous The people behind me were paying in first and I was left for last That immediately struck me as horrible customer service But it doesnt end there When I got home I tried cutting the crumb cake and it was stiff as a hockey puck It just looked really old and dry as I expected Lastly the lobster tail was soggy mushy and flavorless In the end Ive saw Cake Boss and I expected that their pastries were going to be decadent and delicious but it was not close to that Try it at your own risk,negative,162,150-200,841,500-1000
Great Bakery located in Charlotte Best Croissants around and lovely staff The Italian Cream Cake Macaroons and Latte were Exceptional Highly Recommended,positive,22,<50,159,<500
I have to add that in my subsequent visits to Amelies I have learned that their employees are very very unhappy with their management which is quite unfortunate to hear For me even an employees happiness is important when it comes to where I spend my money To Management Have a staff meeting Ask why your employees are unhappy Fix it Your customers will be happier if your employees respect and trust you and your employees will do a better job,positive,81,75-100,457,<500
Great icecream at a reasonable price I love their chocolate banana milkshake,positive,12,<50,79,<500
I visited this location because of all the hype surrounding Donut Bar and because I love Donuts This location is in Down Town Vegas so it can be a little difficult to find if youve never been to DT There is a parking lot across from it as well as meters near so that was a plus As soon as you walk in you are face to face with all kinds of huge and pretty donuts I came in specifically for the Big Poppa Tart Which is a strawberry pop tart stuffed inside of a donut It ended up being very overwhelmingly sweet but a fun donut idea overall We bought an assortment of yeast raised donuts and cake ones to get an overall Donut Bar experience The staff were very genuine and helpful,positive,134,100-150,688,500-1000
This place was so yummy worth the price they give you so much ice cream also it doesnt hurt that the location and food is aesthetically pleasing Would definitely go back to try more flavors and drinks,positive,37,25-50,205,<500
I brought my friend here because I was bragging how good the place was I use to like the location 3 years ago but the service have went downhill This place use to be more professional when I lived here 3 years ago Now since they have grown bigger they dont care about their customers anymore they give us a savory bread with pork on them bacon My friend went to the cashier and ask did this bread have pork and was told noThey lie and said it was not pork but it was we both are Muslim and very disappointed after eating the entire bread sandwich,negative,107,100-150,553,500-1000

I had an AMAZING experience here Not only was the ice cream delicious but the customer service cannot be beat I was having a hard day but I was helped by Mulu and she was the sweetest Completely turned my day around She gave me a great recommendation for ice cream as well as some positive words of encouragement This girl was the highlight of my week and I was lucky enough to meet her thanks to Choc Shoppe Ice Cream 1010 would recommend and ask for Mulu,positive,88,75-100,470,<500
I am obsessed My coworkers showed me this placed a few months ago and now I have to come here at least once or twice a month I love their seasonal coffees My favorite item on the menu is the tomato spinach and mozzarella quiche I ask for my quiche to be heated twice only because sometimes once just isnt enough Ive gotten it cold a few times and I hate taking food back It makes me feel like Im wasting it But nonetheless its still very yummy,positive,88,75-100,459,<500
So I have never been here and I have lived in Pittsburgh a few times in my life Now that I live a hop skip and a jump away from this fabulous little place we finally made it there and I have now been there twice This is for one reason it is scrumptious They have so many soft serve flavors arctic swirls dippy cones Southside shakes milkshakes you name it really There is something here for everyone The inside of the stand looks clean too which is a huge plus for me The kids that work there are also very nice A,positive,103,100-150,535,500-1000
I never post reviews but I felt compelled to do so after my experience tonight I have been coming to Mary Coyle for years and have always had excellent service Tonight I called in an order which has been no problem in the past and the young lady informed me that I could come in so they could take my order but hang on Im with a customer right now and then Ill take your order Ok So after waiting for about 10 mins she takes my order and said it would be ready soon We arrive about 15 minutes later and were informed that they hadnt even started making our milkshakes yet We finally get them and I cant begin to explain how disappointing it was They were tasteless and runny It was clear they rushed it since they didnt make it the first time and were in a hurry to close The young lady that spoke with me gave my husband attitude about our refund since they refused to remake them Go work at Dairy Queen if you arent going to respect the Mary Coyle name and give attitude to loyal paying custoemrs Period,negative,196,150-200,1031,1000-1500

overrated indeed tried 6 of their macarons flavors and most if not all taste fresh in terms of flavor they all tasted somewhat artificial definitely something you try once to see for yourself and can say that youve tried it before but never go back for more type of dealio There are better macaron places out there Their chocolate chip cookies are good but then again how wrong can you go with chocolate chip cookies haha,negative,76,75-100,429,<500
We tried the cereal milk soft soft serve I threw it away after a taste It tasted like rotten milk to me The nastiest ice cream Ive ever had We also had the confetti cake slice it was okay Tasted like it had been stored in the fridge for weeks,negative,50,25-50,249,<500
This place did not live up to the hype Amelies is overpriced and food is soso The croissant was cold the soup was extremely pricey and the sandwich had zero taste The only thing I didnt try was something from the dessert menu I tried to get something but they said they ran out Now Im not an expert baker or anything but seeing how this is a bakery why couldnt they just BAKE another dessert for me The atmosphere was nice but compares nothing to going to a real BAKERY in a place like NYC And having free WIFI is great but Panera Bread has that too and at that so does my house 2 stars for this place,negative,120,100-150,624,500-1000
I stopped in on a Saturday morning and bought one of their strawberry swirl cheesecakes for my husbands birthday It is seriously the best cheesecake Ive had in Charlotte The crust is PERFECT I also ordered a slice which is huge of their peanut butter chocolate cake which is rich and delicious I cant wait to go back to try the cinnamon rolls Great customer service too,positive,67,50-75,381,<500
While the ice cream is yummy the staff is always so unfriendly They never seem happy and its like they are doing you a favor by providing you with expensive ice cream Theres often a lady who Im assuming is the mgr that the employees seem very uncomfortable with Last time I was there an employee dropped the bag she was going to put our to go order in on the floor and she was still going to use it for our order I asked her nicely to use one that didnt fall on the floor and then she proceeded to fold the dirty one and put it back for the next customer This is not right in food handling services and I would think that employees would have been taught that  seems pretty basic to me,negative,138,100-150,696,500-1000

Although this place is known for its sweets I love coming here for lunch They serve a pretty nice assortment of food as well as their dessert items All items are displayed behind glass cases During busier hours they serve you by your number so be sure to take one when you enter I usually get the spinach bread and a large order of their seafood mac and cheese If you havent had their mac and cheese youre missing out There is such great flavor to it The pasta itself is cooked perfectly every time and it isnt overly cheesy The mac and cheese is topped with bits of real crab meat It tastes amazing Their spinach bread is made fresh daily Its basically a large bun stuffed with spinach and a bit of cheese It tastes great with their fresh marinara sauce I like their pastries as well their tiramisu is quite good Im also a fan of their restaurant bread Prestis supplies the bread to most of the restaurants in Little Italy What I like about this place is that its a great place to hang out and people watch The store front has floor to ceiling windows that overlook the busy street,positive,205,200-250,1115,1000-1500
Like everyone else in Charlotte I love Amelies especially this location Its beautiful parking is easy and theres tons of seating Being open 247 is a little weird but obviously it works for them I tend to frequent during more normal coffeeshop hours but Ive seen lines out the door at 10pm on Saturdays so who am I to judge After reading through some of these reviews here and reflecting on my past visits I guess they do have quite a few glutenfree options  the bread for sandwiches is great and obviously the saltedcaramel brownie is a winner Im one of those annoying Northeast transplants though so Im used to being able to get the glutenfree version of literally anything my first visit to Amelies was a little disappointing in that arena only because everything in the display case looked unbelievably delicious but was also flourfilled Since that initial visit Ive realized that the wheatfree soups are a major find and that Amelies does make an intentional effort to cater to the obnoxious glutenfree customer Atmosphere is everything Ive posted many an Instagram photo from the lovely cozy corners of this cafe Its a beautiful place that NoDa is very lucky to have,positive,204,200-250,1217,1000-1500
Im updating my review but this review is for the uptown location Staff are super friendly pastries are good service is excellent even though its always packed The fact that its 5 minutes away from my office makes it even better I almost always do Johnny Burrito and then a coffee afterwards,positive,52,50-75,300,<500
Love this place Specialty blends and signature treats Soooo good The pack pints and quarts Reasonable prices Ez walk up windows,positive,21,<50,133,<500
Are you kidding me Buy 6 take a dozen Ok done Every single option of doughnut was to good to be true From the PB  J to that apple fritter These people got it going on Hats off to the pastry chef The downfall is you have to get there early or you wont get very many options to choose from,positive,62,50-75,304,<500
Came to this location for some goodies to take home There are 2 locations one on the 1st floor and one on the 2nd If they are out if something you might want maybe try going up or down the escalator and see what they have We ended up getting the last 2 ohoh  a fancy ho ho and they were out of salted caramel macarons downstairs but they had them all upstairs For those who have not been to bouchon before the bakery makes great stuff and you cant go wrong with anything usually We normally get a couple of macrons and some oh ohs and maybe something else if it looks interesting The locations here have less than Napa but still has a good variety Stop by and check it out if needing to fill you sweet tooth,positive,141,100-150,722,500-1000
This isnt a review of the store per se I just polished off what I thought was a pint of key lime pie and it was delicious However thats where the love affair ends My pint was 13 two big air bubbles so yeah I feel pretty ripped off for my 7 bucks,negative,53,50-75,258,<500

Ok sweets but the employees enjoy their cellphones mote than those jobs and it is painfully obvious,negative,17,<50,100,<500
I thought by all of the high star ratings that this place has that this was going to be a great ice cream place After reviewing the extensive menu I decided to try a brownie hurricane There was not anyone else waiting and it seemed to take a while to prepare What I received was a cup of melted ice cream with some brownies in it It was very unappealing Ive had milkshakes thicker than this On top of that it 5 for this melted ice cream dont think Ill ever be going back,negative,94,75-100,485,<500
Overrated and overpriced We went first thing in the morning and the donuts were really dry They tasted like they were old not fresh We tried five different ones and I wasnt impressed I didnt even want to eat them They did have good chocolate milk though,negative,47,25-50,262,<500
DISSAPOINTED I hate to give one of my favorite tv stars a negative review but the hype isnt what it seems The pastries are way over priced and you can get better deserts at your local grocery store for the fraction of the price Their open baking viewing area was in disarray and the set up of the pastries was unappealing Save your money,negative,64,50-75,342,<500
As always Mitchells never disappoints when I want highquality ice cream What I love most about this location in particular is that customers can also purchase tickets to tour the facility learn how ice cream is made and discover the history behind Mitchells Homemade Ice Cream The tour also comes with an ice cream tasting as well as a voucher for a scoop of ice cream So essentially you get back the money you spent purchasing the tour ticket All in all no matter how interested you are in the ice cream tour offered at this location do yourself a favor and GET MITCHELLS ICE CREAM,positive,106,100-150,604,500-1000

5 stars for the macaron alone  great value considering price taste and size Pistachio flavor soo yummy The raspberry and salted caramel were OK but pale in comparison to the pistachio Knocked it down to 4 stars though because the chocolate almond croissant didnt live up to my expectation or past experiences Have definitely had better was a bit too hard and crunchy and lacked some of that light flakey texture you expect from a croissant Would definitely come back for the macaron,positive,84,75-100,496,<500
I had high expectations for this place I was thinking its like high end milkshakes cakes and unique deserts Instead it was like diabetes Sugar overloaded menu of colorful confetti sprinkled cakes shakes and cookies It just didnt look appealing to me I ordered a slice of their 15 Chocolate BDAY cake and it was dry hard sweet Skip this place in Vegas and better off trying the Hello Kitty Cafe,negative,71,50-75,408,<500
I have been wanting to try this place for a few months and today I finally made it in So happy I did I had a small scoop of the matcha ice cream with fruity pebbles mixed in and it was DELICIOUS I didnt get her name but the sweet young lady that helped me was very knowledgeable and suggested I get the matcha coffee She was even kind enough to Google items that we were unsure had gluten in it I really appreciated her assistance and I will definitely go back again Oh yeah and I got two matcha coffees One for the ride home to Sahuarita and one for tmrw morning,positive,113,100-150,572,500-1000
This is literally my favorite place ever Everything is so good Its a perfect place to come and do work as there is free wifi My favorite items are the salted caramel brownie and the key lime tart,positive,38,25-50,200,<500

the atmosphere is very cute as many reviewers have previously stated and the cafe drinks are pretty decent However the cake i found to be overly buttery quite dense and a little dry I tried both vegan and nonvegan cake slices and will be sticking to other places to satisfy my sweet tooth,negative,53,50-75,295,<500
This place was underwhelming and over hyped The only pros are the staff are friendly and efficient Despite this lines were long and there was a long wait I ordered a red velvet cheesecake slice Instead they gave me a red velvet cupcake Everything is prepackaged so I had no idea until I got back to the hotel It tasted AWFUL I usually love red velvet but it was dry and the icing was extremely salty I have never had a red velvet cupcake so gross If you are looking for a bakery skip this one,negative,96,75-100,505,500-1000
This downtown shop has some great donuts but you really need to get there early before they sell out Pros are the donuts were good and unique and there is seating in the back outside Cons were the music was kind of loud and it is a bit small inside,positive,50,25-50,251,<500
AMERICA Save yo money Expensive and mediocre product Soooo overated Cupcakes at Albertsons and Ralphs are way better than this piece of shit Imagine that And some pushy sales lady Stay away Yall thank me later,negative,36,25-50,221,<500

Wow and WOW I have been anticipating trying these heavenly breaths of life for months when I frequented SD often but could NEVER get up early enough to experience one Well this morning I was determined to make it happen Since its recent opening downtown I had no excuses to push this aside Get out of bed and get those darn donuts before they sell outAGAIN Me  2 8am slightly raining and a line out the door I seriously couldnt have been more excited The line of people were also in a good mood which made the wait pleasant Standing in the rain 12 awake and before coffee I couldve cared less especially because my experience was great Once in the door the menu was pleasingly overwhelming incredibly creative options and Vegan options as well We got the crÃme brÃlÃe Strawberry Split French Toast and the Maple Bacon Cinnamon Rolls To the staff You are epic The upbeat attitude smiles all around and patience during your power hours are much appreciated It felt like we were being hosted in your home AND that we were the only customers there during our order You unexpectedly exceeded my expectations with your service and good vibes,positive,204,200-250,1184,1000-1500
I loved this place when it was scary looking and I love it even more now that its fancy looking Such freaking good donuts and the staff is so nice Thank goodness they accept cards now so I can eat even more donuts lol the fancyfun looking ones are cute but Im more of a simple girl Their classic donuts are my fav Blueberry is delicious and soft LOVE the maple bacon The twist donuts are great in all the flavors Gotta get there in the morning to get exactly what you want A place worth the drive to get to,positive,101,100-150,519,500-1000
Im from CA on a business trip therefore I wanted something to do in NC and Yelp was a lot of help in finding Amelies However I can not say the same for the staff at Amelies I order my tart and coffee and was told they would take it to my table Well I never got my coffee bc no one told me that I had to pick it up at the coffee bar and no one was nice enough to take it to my table On other bad note I wanted to buy some of there tarts and take them back to CA to give to my friends and staff However this same staff told me that they do not have any boxes to put them that would help with the air flight She did not ever try to help me To bad for her bc I wanted to buy enough for 50 members of my staff Wow someone does not like making money Thats ok bc I could always take my business where it is welcome,negative,179,150-200,822,500-1000
LOVE Carlos Bakery My husband convinced me to go to Vegas by saying I could eat some treats here Sooo glad I allowed him to talk me into it We came in the late afternoon There was a pretty long line I was nervous as I had read here how slow it was I found this to not be the case We waited in line past the restrooms for about 20 minutes The girl in charge of the line did a great job at keeping the line moving and nicely telling people who were cutting where the end was Once inside it was a bit smaller than it should be I ordered my lobster tails and some cupcakes The person who helped me was wonderful and called me up soon to check my order Then I had to wait to be called up again to pay Thankfully they opened a second register which made it much quicker Ive had one of the lobster tails Yummy and soooo worth it Loving them Cupcakes are actually nice and moist and delicious A little pricey but worth it in my opinion Definitely would recommend this place especially the lobster tails,positive,197,150-200,1016,1000-1500
I have never paid 1500 for one small scoop of Mango sorbet and one small scoop of Cotton Candy ice cream with a small teaspoon of almonds for my granddaughter Nothing was special about this I will never go back it was a total rip off No GMOs okay and I liked that idea of natural sugars but come on 1500 for the smallest scoop unbelievable,negative,66,50-75,351,<500
Im a huge fan of their home made yogurt tarts and crossants It is a good place to get a quick breakfast or lunch when staying at the Venetian or Palazzo and you dont have time to go up to the Bouchon restaurant upstairs You can defenitely taste that they use high quality ingredients in everything,positive,56,50-75,304,<500
I had seen countless of pictures of this place and its near my home so I always wanted to try it I mentioned it to my brother and he said it was not worth it but I still wanted to try it I finally went there and first off the outside is cute but once your inside to get your ice cream its nothing fancy I got the mangoniada sherbert and it was just ok nothing to rave about I think the price was just a little to much for the taste and what you get My friend got a different flavor dont recall the name but I do know she was not happy with it Not a place I will be going back to,negative,125,100-150,587,500-1000
We stopped in this ice cream shop on Wednesday around lunch time The shop was empty and the ice cream was in the process of being moved into the display cases The owner was very friendly and helped us make decisions on what to get We loved the unique flavors and decided to go with a Cinnamon Toast Crunch ice cream topped with a macaron and torch roasted marshmallow Were were worried about the combo being too sweet but it was actually very delicious and not overwhelming The texture of the macaron was good and the marshmallow was warm and gooey perfection I was impressed with the ice cream selection and that they made their marshmallows in house,positive,118,100-150,658,500-1000
I went here for my birthday the line wait was not as bad as I thought I went on a Friday and we waited for like about 20 minutes However the prices are outrageous everything thats cake is 1000 and above The only good thing I tasted was the lobster tail The lobster tail is a must have This place was not what I expected I actually had high expectations of it and watching all the seasons and how you hear Buddy talking about his pastries seems like they are the best pastries you would ever have and No The pastries are average There is better local bakeries you can go to around your area that will have better pastries than here to be honest The best thing you can purchase is a lobster tail,negative,135,100-150,710,500-1000
Im sorry but nothing is worth waiting that long for Wait in line in the hot sun for 20 minutes to get something that only takes 5 minutes to eat seems insane I truly think is more of a Fab than anything else Apply that to anything else in life and you wouldnt do it so why here Plus this is the saltiest Icecream Ive ever had I truly hate that Pikes closed and lost business to this place That was a historical place in the QC,negative,87,75-100,441,<500
Bouchon bakery is conveniently located in the Venetian near a public dining area I was craving breakfast pastries and decided to try my luck here I read a lot of good reviews and was prepared to wait in line if need be To my pleasant surprise there wasnt much of a wait I got the chocolate almond crossaint which I loved The crossaint itself was made to perfection as it was extra flaky so delicious I also got the ham egg and cheese crossaint Again so very flaky yummy The only con for the ham egg and cheese crossaint is that it is too salty Takeaway A bit on the pricier side but its Vegas very good crossaint texture convenient,positive,120,100-150,660,500-1000
I definitely expected more from this bakery Being that buddy v is a celebrity patisserie chef The lobster tail is hard and has no taste to it The oatmeal raisin cookie looks delicious but is tasteless I wont be going back anytime soon,negative,43,25-50,240,<500
Ice cream is good Service though thats another story So SLOW Slow Thursday night and it took them 10 minutes to give us 2 scoops of Ricky road Will not be back,negative,32,25-50,166,<500
We walked in like a bunch of hooligans expecting to be shunned by the morning crowd of blue collar and business folk coming in for their morning Joe Instead we were greeted with open arms and immediately given excellent service We got 18 donuts and were amazed by how good they are Will for sure come back,positive,57,50-75,310,<500
Stopped by on my trip to Vegas this past weekend I went towards the end of the day so Im not sure if all the options were there I purchased 3 items 1 that they are known for and random 2 flavors Was not that great and didnt finish any of them Thankfully I didnt have to wait in line,negative,60,50-75,291,<500
Youve probably heard by now that you can purchase cupcakes via an ATM This comes in handy not only because the line is really long normally but its really cool Youll pay a 35 per item using the ATM but the cookie I had was pretty close to warranting that price I think the coolness factor is really high but I dont plan on parking my car at the Quad and walking through the LINQ,positive,75,50-75,391,<500
First of all its not custard Its ice milk Says so on their website Staffed by high school kids who dont understand the concept of moving quickly when theres a line out the door Be prepared to stand in line watching teenagers fumble around trying to find all the sundae toppings Or you could drive to the dairy barn in Sidney and drive back while your friends are still in line at Jarlings Their ice milk is pretty decent if you happen to pass by when there isnt a line Illini Pie is also a good choice,negative,97,75-100,515,500-1000
Unbelievable Having heard of Christina Tosi this was on our horizon to visit however we were usually too full from other restaurants in the area to just stop by We were fortunate because after dining at Momofuku the dessert was from Milk Bar Ive always wanted to try Milk Bar so it was perfect We had the Crack Pie a la Mode OMG Crack pie is what it is called  CRACK But the cereal milk ice cream I cant tell you how much this was a Ratatouille Anton Ego moment Its not cereal flavored ice cream its really the bottom of the cereal bowl while watching Saturday morning cartoons WOW No question we will return,positive,116,100-150,637,500-1000
Awesome milkshakes Huge calorie overload but nice to enjoy once in a while I even got one if their smaller milkshakes and had to throw in the towel Food was great too,positive,32,25-50,171,<500
I did expect better Ive seen the reviews seen the chef on tv and even went back twice But all three items didnt ever call me back The crack pie made me believe I could easily quit crack It was forgettable The birthday cake shake was not the party I was expecting And the compost cookie was not even as good as Paneras Kitchen sink cookie Too bad because I really wanted to like this place as its location is awesome and the help is great there Ill be back at the Cosmo and when I do hopefully theyll have something new for me too try,negative,106,100-150,553,500-1000
WATCH the drive thru 1 of 4 orders were correct 1 we got oatmeal raisinsomething I would never ever ever say or contemplate 1 they substituted marshmallows for cream 1 the jr was made into a medium and the medium was a junior Why dont they write down the order,negative,50,25-50,270,<500
I visited Dripps with my husband The decor was super cute and I liked that they had a wall for the Instagram pictures One of the employees helped us out by explaining the menu and helping us pick our options My husband ended up getting one of their signature ones cookies and cream I ended up making my own shake with fruity pebbles I loved the variety and how I could make my ice cream the way I wanted,positive,79,75-100,410,<500
Super good Had to try this place who doesnt love cupcakes Plus the cupcake arm is awesome I had the vanilla and the black and white vanilla frosting and chocolate cake Cupcakes were moist and delicious They are a decent size so we split them between three of us They also have mini cupcakes if you dont want a full size Such a cute shop too,positive,66,50-75,353,<500

Beyond disappointing Went here the second day after they opened at 10 am there doors were shut Went again an hour later the doors were still shut Went to concierge and they called them and they lied to concierge saying theyve been open since 10 We came back today 1717 a few days We ordered the deal sampler thing a coffee milk shake and the birthday quake We were trying to get a quick treat before having to walk over to bellagio for o and wanted to get free parking at cosmo while it lasted We had 45 min which we thought was plenty of time No one was in line and 3 shakes were ordered before us they obviously got there things before us and we saw There had to be about 710 people on staff there Only 1 person was making orders everyone else was chatting in front of the register while this poor girl is struggling to make these orders We were given the cookies and truffles and pie at the register so we had those but had to wait 25 minutes to get our milk shake and quake Then had to remind them to give us our soft serve which they made ever so slowly it was ice cream and cornflakes We werent sure why it took so long but we went with it The compost cookie was terrible I like pretzels and stuff but it just tried too hard The crack pie is def overrated I would prefer the pecans The lady described it like a pecan pie without pecans I wasnt paying attention so i got excited for pecans to realize she said without them thats my b The birthday truffle was too sweet for me The birthday quake had an off taste that i wasnt a fan of and the coffee milkshake wasnt sweet enough oddly We then were out 60 bucks and didnt like anything So we went back with the milk shake hopping they would remake us something else We asked what they recommended and we got a chocolate shake Cant go wrong with that We then realized we jinxed it It was bitter and not sweet so we tossed it in a garbage and left I love the cosmo hotel but there not putting good things in place of the old and the prices are just highway robbery I dont see this location lasting and go there with no expectations that way you might enjoy overpriced desserts or just go to sweet raku,negative,423,300- 500,2208,2000+

Tasty creamy nutty and smooth were the words my mom used to describe the Maple Pecan ice cream Creamy salty sweet and smooth was how my husband described the Salted Butter Caramel ice cream Aaaaaaahhhhhhmazing is how I would describe the basil lime sorbet Fresh light sweet and just the right amount of sugary goodness I asked the woman behind the counter for the igredients and she said basil lime ice and sugar I ate it on one of the tiny little spoons and savored every little bite I know that I will be back during my next visit to AZ to visit mom bc I still cant stop thinking about that darn sorbet Kudos to you Sweet Republic Kudos on creating a solid additive and preservative free  whole foods approach to sweet desserts YUM,positive,136,100-150,759,500-1000

Deeeeelish Tried a smorgasbord of the pasties A chocolate croissant banana nut bread and cheese Danish By far cheese Danish was the BEST banana nmbread was a second and chocolate croissant was last Cheese Danish had plenty of cream cheese filling banana bread had a hint of banana and was pretty hefty chocolate croissant was meh not enough chocolate for my taste Overall I would definitely go back for the cheese Danish The coffee was good but super strong Be ready for lots of cream and sugar Staff is great very friendly and all adhered to covid protocol and the line moved fast If you stop by or stay at the venetian resort this is a must try,positive,118,100-150,662,500-1000
Best Ice Cream Ever I cant believe given the option between going here and going across the street to the Evil Ice Cream Parlor Which Must Not Be Named people actually choose the latter The Chocolate Shoppe has some of the most delectable ice cream flavors known to man They have many different flavors each day that rotate out so youre not always seeing the same stuff each time you go in If youre able to try Fat Elvis my favorite Banana ice cream with chocolate and peanut butter or Zanzibar Chocolate its hot  sexy chocolateondarkchocolate action Theyll sometimes have soy ice cream too which I think is great One of the reasons I like them above all other ice creameries though is their disclaimer on the wall It reads Nutrition Dont even ask This is the best ice cream made in Wisconsin and it tastes so good because it has gobs of rich Wisconsin cream and tons of real ingredients for boatloads of delicious flavors That means its not lowfat lowcalorie or lowanything and thats why everyone loves it You want nutrition eat carrots Hee hee,positive,188,150-200,1098,1000-1500
I was SO excited to FINALLY get to try something from Carlos I have been a fan of Cake Boss for as long as I can remember and was always SO jealous of the constant line of people that got to go and try it out Everything always looks so good I was in Las Vegas this past weekend and remembered they opened one there inside the Venetian I couldnt wait I had to try a cannoli The rest of the items I just picked out as I saw them I purchased 4 items and it was just under 18 I didnt care about the price at that point Here is what we got and what we thought of it Cannoli Honestly I think the cannoli was the best one Ive tasted so far I dont get them a lot but this one was good Hazelnut Cream Puff Nope This one ended up in the trash unfortunately It was disgusting I hate to say it but it tasted like disappointment It had a very strange taste to it and the hazelnut was very faint and subtle That was a waste of money Vanilla Cupcake I always find cupcakes made at fancy bakerys to be completely gross I dont know what it is but they seem to taste like wallpaper glue and people LOVE them I dont get it This was no different I cant really describe what it tasted like but it was not what cakefrosting should taste like Salted Caramel Eclair This one was for a friend so I didnt get to taste it but he said it was just ok Overall I was disappointed and felt like I could take that 18 and throw it in the trash Im glad I finally got to try it but will not return again I hate to say it but store bought cupcakes are better than Buddys Maybe New York taste is different than here on the West coast because they have been in business for so long but I didnt care for any of it We have a grocery store chain here that used to carry a few of his cakes They were shipped in I remember buying one and not liking it then but I was really hoping that buying fresh from the bakery itself would be different I know its hard to pass up trying for yourself I wouldnt have but trust me save yourself the money on this one Such a bummer,negative,415,300- 500,2091,2000+
OMG their croissants are a piece of art I literally dissected it in half just to check out the layers of pure butter Make sure there are no holes in the center buttery and soft in the center flaky on the outsideetc It was PERFECTO D Just like their Americano I recommend the Pain Au Chocolat Fun lil story My mom crowned herself a pastry and coffee queen Shes really happy with a pasty or 2 or 3 in the morning with her coffee So we must have this every morning while were in town She loves Venetian for this bc they have this stand right outside the elevators on the Casino floor She orders the Americano and says something is wrong Sis who knows nothing about coffee takes it back cuz my moms a queen like that  and tells them it doesnt taste right The barista takes the cup and says they gave her drip coffee on accident OMG Its been confirmed my mom is crazy Too bad they dont have baguettes at the stand,positive,177,150-200,951,500-1000
I have been here twice Nice store but their corn is stale not fresh I experienced this both times I even asked if the corn was fresh but it isnt I might give it a third try but I hope this iconic place steps it up,negative,46,25-50,220,<500

I was thrilled to visit this bakery I was not thrilled to make that 30 minute line The choices are so limited Nothing like the Hoboken original bakery shown on tv The canolis not so good I guess since we went late they were probably there for hours The reason I gave it 4 stars regardless the bad stuff the lobster tail was amazing It was big tasty and great prize I am now looking forward to go to the one in Hoboken in December,positive,85,75-100,444,<500

I had the chocolate walnut meringue cookie hazelnut lobster tail and French cream lobster tail I was disappointed with the cookie it didnt have that fall apart on the outside chewy on the inside type of texture The fillings for the lobster tails were delicious but the crusts were meh The pastries didnt seem to be freshly made Oh pretty expensive 550 per lobster tail,negative,65,50-75,382,<500

Wow Wowzers Great Scott Great Googoo Moogoo Holy moly Holy S Are you kidding me right now Hopscotch is absolutely incredible The service the baked goods especially the cinnamon roll bread pudding and the food especially the Caprese Sandwich are just unbelievable Honestly the only thing I can think of that would be better than the combination of those two things I mentioned would be likefree ice cream and never having to clean your apartment again Do yourself a favor once in your pathetic life and go to Hopscotch Bakery I dont have photos because when I was eating these things nothing else existed in the world at that moment,positive,110,100-150,658,500-1000
Its pretty good stuff although a little pricey Im a fan of the cold fudge and tortoise sundaes And the waffle cones yum I mean its your average local ice cream shop a great idea for when family comes into town or youre just not sure what to do with yourself you want to splurge on a treat for yourself etc,positive,61,50-75,320,<500
My favorite stop for coffee here I just love their cappuccino cakes Every time I go there I ask for their cappuccino cakes I dont know if they buy it or make it there but it just tastes so good The environment is so pleasant and I enjoy being served in their cup and saucer,positive,55,50-75,278,<500
You hate to spend 8 for a slice of cake and not enjoy it The people are wonderfully nice however the cake definitely fell short of expectations I asked what type of frosting it was and they said buttercream however this is not traditional buttercream with a good flavor The cake is not vanilla It has a slight metallic flavor like something went wrong during the baking process and it was slightly over baked I am very disappointed in the quality of this cake,negative,84,75-100,468,<500
I wanted some good French baked goods and I was so disappointed The croissant and the pain au chocolat had no crunch and honestly seemed like they were a day old The coffee however was good but I dont recommend any of the baked goods there,negative,46,25-50,243,<500
My sister went to Vegas and bought me some of their macaroons At 4 a piece she thought it would be very tasty Unfortunately these were harder than rocks When you take a bite it feels like you broke a part of your tooth off The flavor is nothing special nothing tastes just same old same old I definitely will not return to this establishment for macaroons,negative,67,50-75,364,<500
We got here at noon also and also found there to be no line We were excited to try it and pleasantly surprised that they had several vegan donut choices And it was buy one get one free so we were out of there for under 4 The donuts were very very sweet I know donuts are supposed to be sugary but this took it to a new level My teeth hurt a little so I picked the fruit off of the top and threw the rest away My husband said that he had to do the same with his That said we did arrive late so we had slim pickings Perhaps if we got there earlier we would have had more choices,negative,123,100-150,592,500-1000
disappointed after hearing such good things about this place Its pretty pricy for something that wasnt good Def wouldnt go back And the person that helped me seemed a little annoyed because I placed a big order and she kept having to go back and fourth,negative,46,25-50,258,<500
I love doughnuts and this spot didnt disappoint They had a wide variety to chose from and quite a few gourmet options that you just dont see very often Of course we got more than we could possibly eat in one sitting but it was so hard to chose They all looked so delicious Staff was super friendly and helpful Easy walking distance from the Fremont St area,positive,68,50-75,365,<500
One of the best ice cream I have ever had Tastes like childhood Their flavors are fancy but not to a point when they taste wierd I absolutely love their sweat cream ice cream and honey whipped cream,positive,38,25-50,202,<500
Located downtown right next to Carsons Kitchen downtown makes this quite the journey for me but I still do it Love the maple bacon cronut The best They typically sell out of the most popular items really quickly Almost everything is pretty much gone by early afternoon If you want to get the goods head there early,positive,57,50-75,321,<500
Everything sounded so good and delicious but after paying close to 13xx for ONE cookie and ONE milkshakeit was SO not worth it I ordered a chocolate cereal milk milkshake for my kids and a cookie I forgot which one I got The 850 milkshake tasted like a typical chocolate milkshake Nothing special at all I couldve went to Innout and got a cheaper one that tasted the same And the cookie was no better than the frozen dough you can bake yourself at home I will definitely not recommend wasting your time and money here,negative,96,75-100,540,500-1000
I have a friend who lives in las Vegas and has been talking about how great this place is Ive never been a big fan of donuts but I wanted to try it while I was here for the weekend OMG This place is awesome Ive never seen so many kinds of donuts they have a huge variety and Ive been told they always change the flavors My favorite ones were French toast and creme brulee But I recommend trying all of them You wont get tired they are not too sweet The place is clean very organized service is great Even though there are a lot of people you wont be waiting in line for too long they are fast If you want to eat there and you dont find a place inside the restaurant they have a great patio with chairs and tables outside You have to try these donuts You wont regret it they have great coffee too,positive,161,150-200,827,500-1000

This place is not ideal for large groups I took a group of about 18 girls to Churn for a celebration and we experienced the utmost rudest customer service ever We called the day before to give the workers a heads up that we would be coming in with a larger group However when we arrived our group was rushed spoken to like children and even had some of our orders tossed at us instead of handed to us like a good paying customer When we were leaving we could overhear the workers talking about some of our girls in an inappropriate manner I believe that this type of treatment was uncalled for as we did our best to insure that our group treated the workers with respect and grace even though that was not the treatment that we were given I am so disappointed because our girls were so excited for this celebration and it was tainted by the workers contempt Like I said this is not a good place to take large groups if you are wanting friendly service,negative,181,150-200,963,500-1000
Had breakfast and coffee here while in Charlotte Cute decor  no inside dining at this point but they have tables outside The staff was very helpful friendly and pleasant offered a lot of help in terms of choices We had a few items to taste We also ordered coffees cute place  Id definitely go back,positive,57,50-75,310,<500

Worst experience ever I ordered a dozen macaroons which was over 40 only to see the person behind the counter grab the display box and some sanitizer wipes from underneath the counter and go in the back room When she came back out I asked her what she did with the wipes and the box that she put out macaroons in She said that she wiped down the box and the plastic container because they ran out of boxes As a customer that just spent over 70 on pastries the least I expect is a new box and not having to worry about whether or not Im ingesting cleaning chemicals This is an embarrassment Tom Keller train your employees to have some common sense On top of that when we asked for 3 cups of ice water the employee told us they are normally 50 cents each Really I just spent 70 on some pastries you cant give me water Im surprised they didnt charge me for each napkin,negative,169,150-200,885,500-1000
The service here is great The guy who helped me greeted me with a smile and was very pleasant and helpful This isnt a walk in restaurant You walk up to the counter and place your order from their selection of desserts that include cookies and whole cakes The birthday cake is their most famous cake and the only one the sell by the slice The birthday cake costs a hefty 16 I got it and I regret it It did not live up to the hype It was a decent cake It wasnt bad but for the price I expect more The milk they soak it with makes it similar to a tres leche but not quite as wet Its on par with a grocery store cake at best Im a cake connoisseur and ive had far better for far less Maybe the cookies are better But dont waste your time or money on the birthday cake Just go for the cute appearance and nice service,negative,167,150-200,839,500-1000
I went to try the Ice Cream and it was flavorless and the staff was not very helpful or knew much about the product I paid 8 not a bad price for a product that I now know is completely disgusting Things to notice if you decide to visit that shop 1 The play on words and names of the ice cream 2 The over frost and frost bite on the ice cream 3 The fact that the offerforce you to take two scoops of their product Over all not a quality product due to lack of flavor Just because they give you more of something doesnt mean its good,negative,110,100-150,550,500-1000
OkI have no idea what could be said other than ice cream made from real wholesome ingredients wins over the opposite Try samplesthere werent too many weirdcrazy combinations but I was surprised when I asked what top 2 flavors are salted caramel  almond butter crunch Awesome that you can get your icecream scoop in between cookies for a icecream sandwich Both in our party that chose that option thought the cookie should be warmed a bit Andtoasted home made marshmallow option pretty interesting and tasty too Will be back,positive,90,75-100,542,500-1000
Cute little bake shop with cakes and brownies  vegan options galore if thats your thing The girl at the counter was super nice and helpful Decided to grab a brownie and it was not a mistake Very fudgey and tasty I have to say the biggest pro to this place is that its open late Its too bad theyre not closer to the bars and restaurants on butler,positive,69,50-75,360,<500
Was scrambling to look for a bakery in the area and this popped up Been driving pass this place so many times and never knew that they existed This place has a very unique selection in terms of flavors of cupcakes cakes parfait baked pastries and brownies I adore their modern and rustic buttercream designs I also appreciate that they offer gluten free options I gotta say if youre looking for plain vanilla this place is not for you I got 67 items from here Theyre a good mix of cupcakes pies and brownies The buttercream on the cupcakes are delicious Not overly sweet yet very light If youre a fan of blueberries try their blueberry oatmeal crumble Otherwise you wont go wrong with their chocolate brownies Its one of the best brownies Ive tasted,positive,135,100-150,779,500-1000
Ive seen a lot of hype about this place and I know theres a location in Los Angeles I hate waiting in long lines so Vegas it is since Im on the area Ive seen plenty of rave reviews about this place and had high HIGH expectations But unfortunately I wasnt too pleased at all This is just based on the ice cream I had and not for the cookies or cakes since I had neither of those I ordered the milk and cereal ice cream with corn flakes Price point is a tad bit high for what you get As for the ice cream itself it REALLY is MILK ice cream I mean I have to give it to milk to get the flavor on point Many ice cream places claim its milk of course I know ice cream is made of milk but not all tastes like milk but does not taste anything like milk So THIS milk ice cream really does taste like milkThe reason for my low rating is the corn flakes I mean i grew up eating corn flakes and frosted flakes and know what they taste like My corn flakes on my ice cream was extremely salty Im not sure if it was meant to be salty to balance out the flavor of the milk But because it was so salty the topping I paid extra for which by the way was a rip off I ended up scooping off because it was PACKED WITH SALT Not pleased with this and nor was it worth the hype Yelp Review 2018 Challenge 82100,negative,268,250-300,1319,1000-1500
REVIEW FOR THE LARGE MACARONS ONLY I was thoroughly disappointed after hearing such rave reviews about their macarons The flavor is seriously lacking and it just wasnt up to par with what Ive tried at other bakeries before I bought the prepackaged box with 6 macarons in it The coffeemocha flavored one was inyourface strong and the chocolate is pretty decadent The raspberry has a subtle flavor I think the best one out of the box was the vanilla bean one The caramel didnt taste like caramel and the pistachio one kind of had a soapy taste to it Time to try my hand at making some myself,negative,108,100-150,606,500-1000
The flavors tasted like they have been sitting around for a couple weeks Filmy texture My daughter had chocolate  vanilla and was complaining about a funny taste So I tried to see what was up Looks like a great place but we wont be back any time soon,negative,49,25-50,257,<500
Theres just not enough stars to rate these two From the carrot cake carbomb cupcakes to pimento cheese filled croissantsif you have a special occasion birthday a holiday gathering or just want a great treat put this one your list Amanda and Paul are always helpful and such a pleasure to work with Youll definitely want to go back again and again And again,positive,64,50-75,374,<500
Great service so many choices Even a doggy cup cake My only wish is a gluten free cup cake option and more then one non dairy sorbet Either way my husband loved his red velvet cup cake with captain crunch ice cream and my strawberry sorbet was Delish,positive,48,25-50,255,<500
The ice cream was okay I like that their macaroon cookie was pretty big It wasnt super flavorful The marshmallow wasnt super sweet which was good The cost was pretty average about 8 for the cookie bowl,positive,37,25-50,209,<500
One of the best ice creams ever I really love the zanzibar chocolate it is fabulous Have not found another chocolate that comes close I work at a restaurant that serves the peppermint stick to rave reviews The customers complain if we dont have it,positive,45,25-50,260,<500
We catered at a clients and I dont know which was better the amazing staff or the ice cream What a great experience Thank you so much Fatty Daddys for such a memorable event,positive,34,25-50,179,<500
Ive learned that if you eat dinner in an ethnicallythemed neighborhood ie Little Italy you should get dessert from the bakery down the street In all likelihood the restaurant is getting their desserts from the bakery and selling them at twice the price with a scoop of gelato and a sprig of mint of course And so it was that I found myself at Prestis The desserts are beautiful Eclairs tarts tons of cookies cream puffs the size of my fist and I have large hands Having learned from previous botched bakery experiences I ordered a cannoli and a piece of tiramisu to go Both were outstanding  probably two of the best desserts I have ever eaten I paid over 6 for the two items which seems pricey but itll actually act as a deterrent for me going there daily to stock up on mascarponericottaladen goodness So when in Little Italy dine at the restaurant of your choice enjoy a glass of dessert wine senza dessert and then walk over to Prestis,positive,173,150-200,979,500-1000
This is the best place for ice cream It gets busy at night but its worth the wait I go here all the time haha,positive,25,<50,113,<500
If you are a fan of pastries then you have to visit Bouchon Though it doesnt look like much when you walk past it this place has some amazing baked goods I highly recommend the financiers think madeleine only better and the chocolate croissants The croissant was buttery and flaky yet not heavy at all They also werent skimpy on the chocolate so thats a major plus And dont hesitate to get a cup of espresso or latte here either It is definitely worth it and much better than that bitter Starbucks junk,positive,93,75-100,520,500-1000
I am not a huge macaroon fan but the macaroons here are amazing Seriously these will make you change your mind the cookie is soft and chewy but the outside is still slightly crispy I only bought one but I wanted to go back for more just thinking about it is making me salivate These macaroons are so worth the 3 something I also go the TK cookie I thought it was a dry and really too sweet for my taste really nothing compared to the macaroon How good is this cookie I was staying at the Excalibur and I WALKED all the way to the Venetian to get one its THAT good,positive,113,100-150,584,500-1000
Maybe Im crazy but when I visit a bakery that has a lot of hype I expect a bakery Not a pop up shop looking store front with a small selection of pastry  To bad because the enormous macrons were Scrumptious but not enough to have me stop by again  There wasnt any seating or anyone willing to help me find the correct bakery spot if there was it is ,negative,73,50-75,357,<500
This place Moment of silence for this place Okay Im back This place has managed to take my two favorite things fluffy delicious donuts and sweet creamy ice cream and merge them together for a delectable treat I stumbled across this place and Ive never made a better discovery I sampled a few different flavors and they were all so good They have a person who creates these amazing flavors and on their own they are so delicious but then paired with a homemade donut and a cereal topping is a combination done perfectly You HAVE to try this place,positive,100,75-100,558,500-1000
It was our departure day and the wife and I were on a Friday night red eye As a result we had a full day to kill before leaving for the airport We decided to cap off our trip with a stop at Milk Bar The wife wanted to try it for her first time and have one of their cookies to see if it would be worth the effort trying to bake it at home I was down since I wanted to give Milk Bar another try to see if my previous soso experience was a oneoff I had the Cereal Milk White Russian 12 It was boozy and possessed the advertised cereal milk flavor From its taste it couldve been something memorable Instead it was memorable for the wrong reasons What I received could hardly be called a milk shake but rather cold cereal milkflavored soup with booze in it The shake was so lacking in thickness my plastic straw was unable to stand up on its own in the cup I drank it right away in the airconditioned comfort of the Cosmo not in the afternoon Vegas heat so I couldnt attribute its immediate souplike quality to the temperature of my surroundings Im not sure if it was due to not enough cereal milk soft serve being used in the mix or using room temperature alcohol instead of it being chilled Regardless it was a failure of execution especially for the price Dairy Queen has nothing to worry about,negative,252,250-300,1327,1000-1500
Stopped by there Sunday morning while walking my 5lb Yorkie asking for a menu so that I can step outside to place an order for some reason couldnt pull up the menu on my phone Unfortunately the woman behind counter no mask couldnt see past the Yorkie kept telling me I can order on line instead of just handing me a menu Bottom line unfriendly staff Not very interested in being helpful to customers or making money Well maybe theyll adjust their attitudes when the place gets no business and they have to look for other jobs especially now No more business from me,negative,104,100-150,583,500-1000
I came here strictly for macaroons and when I saw them they were pretty big compared to most macaroons They sell them in packs or individually They are 3 dollars each I tried the coffee and chocolate flavored macaroons Right when i took a bite of it I was super disappointed It was hard It didnt have enough filling and wasnt chewy and soft enough It tasted crispy which arent how macaroons are suppose to be I actually didnt finish my macaroon and threw it away The first time Ive ever done that,negative,93,75-100,514,500-1000
This bakery deserves 5 stars Everything is so reasonably priced and such high qualitty Amazing customer service too They have savory and sweet pastries You grab your own set of tongs and help yourself Make sure you check out the refrigerated case too  the caramel pudding and strawberry cake is so good,positive,53,50-75,311,<500
Ignoring all the comments about the location okay weird But as my daughter just said I dont think I could make something this bad if I tried We got the namesake peach cobbler Where was the flavor Where was the sweetness Not in our little paper cup And the ice cream Is there a sugar shortage Tasted like frozen milk Love the idea but concept fails here Would also help if it wasnt just in this take out lobbywarehouse Oh well we tried Better desserts await,negative,86,75-100,482,<500
Well typically we are pleased with this place but today not so much The girl that took our order was completely unfriendly and rude and the two pieces of cake I got to go were dinky and crumbled into pieces For about 5 each that sucks,negative,46,25-50,239,<500
Yummy variety of affordable treats great service and even a kids room to occupy the youngsters Come for the halo halo or myriad boba Stay for the atmosphere and the friendly owners and staff Check it out and remember your loyalty card to get free treats,positive,46,25-50,259,<500
Im pretty easy to impress  I love to give good reviews This place though kind of a let down The cupcake was OK probably 3 stars But the order and payment process was a joke The cupcakes are right there hand me one and take my 4 dollars Rather than this simple concept which most bakeries coffee shops and every other type of retailer have mastered you order they write it down meanwhile the cupcake is still right there They take the order in the back not sure what happens there then return grab the cupcake still one foot from where you are standing and place it on the back counter At that point you wait about 35 minutes while the 1 cashier catches up grabs the cupcake and finally takes your payment It wasnt just us Everyone in the store was just standing around asking what was going on Very strange And sorry for 4 the cupcake should be amazing It just wasnt,negative,165,150-200,915,500-1000
After an hour standing in line I got inside and find most of the pastries are out I got a few pastries and they were good The milk tea was delicious Maybe they are too busy and service wasnt great but I dont blame them since they were packed and everyone is working super hard,positive,55,50-75,282,<500

Great Ice Cream A long line when we were there but they kept it moving and in no time we were enjoying our unique flavors of ice cream We sat on the patio theres no indoor seating Its a trendy sort of place We felt a little out of place with our 1 year old but the ice cream was definitely good,positive,62,50-75,306,<500
Stopped by the store Friday am to pickup a dozen for an attorney friend and a dozen for the family Waited 20 minutes since only 1 person working the counter Donuts are fresh and very tasty but when you find not 123 hairs but a whole clump of hair in the middle of your donut frosting makes you lose your appetite for anything Have never had this happen before and we stop there often just a headsup for the owners,negative,80,75-100,425,<500
Aesthetically pleasing bakery with some unique flavor combinations but it lacks in the taste and quality department,negative,17,<50,117,<500
This is an amazing bakery and late night dessert spot We were visiting Pittsburgh from Orlando for a wedding and I found Butterwood via Yelp It is located in Lawrenceville and has an adjacent public parking lot The dessert case was full of great looking cakes pies and bar cookies We had the Chocolate Beet Fig Cake and the Blood Orange Honey Cream Cake The genoise cake layers were super moist and the creams and soaks were flavorful and on point Open sides cakes like these can sometime be dry These were perfect The cake styling reminds me of Christina Tosi of Momofuko Milk Bar This is a beautiful space with a Victorian decor people coming for coffee and tea with leashes dogs I definitely will visit again if I am back in Pittsburgh,positive,134,100-150,751,500-1000
Very disappointed with this place small selection of ice cream way overpriced Some of the ice cream were melted and freeze again sorbet tasted like water with loads of sugar Wont be back,negative,33,25-50,193,<500
The ice cream is great The service is TERRIBLE the people got two of our four orders wrong but refused to remake them They just looked at us and kept saying no this is what you ordered What happened to the customer is always right Very frustrated with the rude service After beging a regular I wont be going back after numberous bad service experiences now,negative,66,50-75,372,<500
Maybe Im used to something a little different on the East Coast but the Donut Bar was all bark and no bite They all looked very aesthetic but not one of them was memorable or had any real outstanding flavor Tried 3 donuts from their large selection Cake BatterOreo Mini 3 Big Poppa Tart Strawberry 5 Strawberry Split 4 The big poppa tart was the biggest let down the filling of the donut was the same dry sticky filling as a actual pop tart it did not blend very well with the soft doughy texture Its a little bit of a hike away from the strip I would say not worth the journey,negative,113,100-150,595,500-1000
Vietnamese coffee and hangover helper in pretzel cone very good,positive,10,<50,63,<500
I could not get enough of this place Ive been to the original Milk in NYC so I was hoping for a similar experience I was not disappointed the Vegas location tastes just like real thing All the ice cream is made from cereal milk and it tastes AMAZEBALLS With or without the cereal crunch toppings this place wont let you down Located inside the Cosmo just up the escalator its in a great location next to many other food options My only gripe is that its a bit pricey but so was the NYC locale,positive,96,75-100,511,500-1000
Got the double Ice Cream and man it was a lot of ice cream so incredibly good Ironically no dark chocolate ice cream choice so I went with a double of Espresso Chip and Chocolate Dang super good but too much ice cream for one person Should have gone with the single GREAT Addition to The LINQ entertainment district,positive,59,50-75,322,<500
The guy who took care of us was the most unfriendliest and rude person Ive come into contact with for a long time My wife and I stopped in to get some pastries for Fathers Day He acted bothered to get anything and also muttered something under his breath about my wife asking for too many items He made us feel extremely unwelcome and we wondered what we could have done to make someone act so fucking rude to us Honestly I will probably never come back here and its a shame because we live down the road Hire some better customer service oriented staff  at least people who dont make you feel bad for ordering the stuff the establishment provides,negative,122,100-150,662,500-1000
COVID19 Edition We were walking around Ohio City when we saw the impressive line out the door for this place and after some internet snooping I figured this place needed to be tried Oh we were so happy we did We ended up getting the Cleveland Brownie Sundae oh it hit the spot The ice cream was great just the right amount of sweetness The brownie was warm melty chocolately and not too heavy The whipped cream hot fudge and pecans were just the perfect combination that kept it from being too sweet but also an amazing mix of textures You know Im going to be here whenever Im in town Is it 30F I dont care Get in the car Were going to Mitchells,positive,125,100-150,672,500-1000
Their milk bar pie did not live up to the hype Tiny boring and expensive for literally 2 bites of boring buttered corn flakes Not sure why its so popular makes sense because a lot of people these days have no common sense,negative,43,25-50,228,<500
If youre considering Ice Cream today your search is over Churn is by far the greatest ice cream around I take a trip up Central to this little Ice Cream shop at least 24 times a week My brothers and I enjoy the variety of flavors and the service is nothing like youve ever experienced before Every employee is an abundance of joy The second you walk through the door youre always greeted with kindness Personal favorite employees are Megan and Raymond they always put a smile on my face So stop by Churn because youve found the Ice Cream and service youve been searching for,positive,106,100-150,592,500-1000
It was just ok for me I come from Chicago and we have a lot of old school ice cream parlors there so im kinda biased As for Vegas ice cream parlors it does the jobtheir ice cream is very creamy and they have variety of flavors My disappointment was when I ordered a shake and asked for it extra thick only because there on the sign you can get it extra thick with a 75 charge Upon getting the shake I found it to be really liquidy maybe thats what they considered thick my definitions of extra thick is when you need to eat with a spoon The prices are a tad high for the amount of ice cream you receive and the best day to go is 2 Tuesday Wish they had more seating areas as well Overall this place is not bad but nothing more than 2 stars from me Its good for those hot summer nights and you want to bring the fams out for a treat I guess for family bonding time Check it out you might like it,negative,184,150-200,921,500-1000
I stopped by on a Friday morning for some breakfast pastries Quick friendly service The strawberry cream horn was very good fresh strawberry flavor flaky pastry and the almond croissant was huge Not a huge fan of the Italian cream cake found it too sweet with the cream cheese frosting Will come back to try more things,positive,57,50-75,330,<500
Went here during labor day weekend to try the cereal milk soft serve It was 6 but for some reason my bank statement says 650 I didnt catch it when he told me the total because I figured it would be just the 6 Check the amount prior to payingleaving The soft serve was so gross I cant believe all the hype on it I took a few bites and threw it away What a waste My friend got the soft serve with corn flakes She kept saying how nasty the soft serve was and how salty the cornflakes were Aside from that experience Ive had some of the cookies before and my fave is the blueberry Crack pie is extremely too sweet and I love sweets,negative,127,100-150,650,500-1000
I _think_ Ive located the right spot to review Three bakeries in the same place and two on top of one another who do you think you are Starbucks I visited and purchased food from the Bouchon Bakery on the first floor of the Grand Canal Shoppes area Its just off the Strip near BB Burger and the outdoor gondola ride We happened upon another Bouchon Bakery when we went upstairs afterward and the original location is somewhere inside The Venetian We found this one to be the most convenient and it had a slightly wider selection than its overhead neighbor I took two items to go and ate them within a few hours The Croissant 375 is a goto pastry and the version here is golden brown outside and chewy outside with enough buttery flavor for anyone but diehard butter fans Aside from how easily some of the outer layer flakes off its comparable to any other versions in town both onStrip and offStrip The Kouign Amann 450 is another classic although its tougher to find Its both more difficult to make and less popular This version does have a lot of the right crispy and chewy textures and the expected sugary flavors I think this one cheats a little though you can easily see a glassy sugar layer on the flat side of the kouign amann and the dough just doesnt have enough layers Its way too flat compared to other good versions that Ive had However if I was blindfolded I would likely have no issue As long as parking stays free at the Palazzo and the Venetian Id consider making regular stops to this Bouchon Bakery for some pastries My first taste was good enough lets say 375 stars averaged between the two bites so Im optimistic about similar results if I venture into the cookies macarons or other baked goods cinnamon rolls monkey bread and so on,positive,322,300- 500,1817,1500-2000
The food quality is outstanding but the service last Sunday around 2pm was some of the worst customer service I have ever had I ordered two coffee drinks and was treated like an idiot because I didnt know that a standard shot is actually two shots of espresso I ordered one drink with an added shot She corrected me telling me that drink is called something different when served in a cup vs mug and when I received the drink from the barrista she called it something different entirely Who knew coffee could be so complicated The person at the counter spoke down to me then went to chat with her coworkers while I waited The drinks were not started until after they finished chatting I asked for clarification on how many shots I was getting and she just did not do a good job explaining and made me feel like a moron I hope they correct this problem because I really want to keep going there,negative,167,150-200,911,500-1000
Absolutely amazing ice cream place with super reasonable prices The chocolate chip cookie sundaes are game changing They actually heat the cookies up in an oven before putting them on your ice cream Portion sizes are huge This place is totally worth visiting,positive,43,25-50,263,<500
Staff was polite and idea has a lot of potential but I wasnt impressed with the quality of ice cream,negative,20,<50,102,<500
Delicious baked goods The cake was much more expensive than what we usually purchase at other bakeries but it was worth it Every bite was amazing Super special If you want top notch bakery I highly recommend Batch Bakehouse,positive,39,25-50,230,<500
No no and no I dont get the hype the ice cream wasnt all that and they can keep that digging into the buckets arm deep and handing that to me to eat Its just a no,negative,37,25-50,167,<500
The shop is cute the photos of cakes and such are impressive  but unfortunately theres two main reasons why I was disappointed 1 Almost half of what was on display was sold out early on a Saturday and 2 There was only one person working who was abysmally slow I also had to argue with her about the free chocolate pretzel even after showing her the Yelp check in The shakes we got were okay however there was WAY too much milk which diluted the flavor and made it sort of bland I dont think Id bother to stop in again,negative,102,100-150,545,500-1000
No place to sit down we shared a slice of the birthday cake Wasnt too impressive and was way over priced 1500 a slice Had to try it out but wasnt worth the money Pretty disappointed,negative,36,25-50,189,<500
I love Carlos Bake shop and I have the highest respect for Buddy and his family business I went to this location for the first time two months ago while travelling through Vegas and the lobster tails were phenomenal They had a FrenchIrish cream folded into the cream It was worth the price We went back today only two months later and ordered 6 of them to go At 6 each when we got to eating them we were all severely disappointed that the famous lobster tails we love only had plain whipped cream in them I do not think Buddy would approve of this location changing his recipe and selling this sub par product in his name I never thought I would write a bad review about Carlos Bake shop,negative,131,100-150,703,500-1000
Its really disappointing how bad they have gotten They changed their menu items and cant answer questions about them  and they got my order wrong I hate being in las vegas and i just wanted some comfort food that i like  and they just butchered it Super bummed out Edit  i got to my room and im looking at the pie slice and its not what I had asked for  which is tough to do when the menu items change and the people behind the counter just say yes to whatever you ask Also  I just didnt have time to wait for you to remake make my iced coffee  you gave me a hot coffee when i ordered iced  because i was running late for a meeting I ordered 2 items and you got them both wrong  I walked 6 miles there and back  have I earned the right to ask for a refund I feel like i have Could I please have my money back You can have the cookie thing back  its not what I wanted,negative,188,150-200,893,500-1000
stopped at coffee stand for cappuccino coffee just average Nothing special Croissant tasted day old Sold out of ham and cheese croissants Staff was clueless and inefficient So I went over to restaurant to purchase items to go and stood at the bar for 10 minutes only to be ignored by the bar staff I went to Bouchons in Napa and it was wonderful Wont be back here and I dont recommend either Bouchons in Vegas Disappointed,negative,77,75-100,438,<500
I met up with visiting family here I wasnt feeling too great scheduled for oral surgery soon so I took a few bites of what everyone was having than having my own Grasshopper cake was moist and had good minty flavor but too sweet Crack pie pretty good it reminds me and my brothers something from our childhood called Food for the Gods Its sweet and rich so I like to eat small pieces at a time I do like the flavor so I would probably recommend this I think youre starting to see a theme this is more American sweet level than French or Asian desserts Its not for those who dont love a sugar rush I heard of the famous birthday cake so I took a slice to go and a crack pie to bring my MIL home My husband takes the cake piece out of the fridge later that night for our nightcap and says he took a bite and tells me its STALE So I touch the outside of the cake and its got that crust when the cake is dried out I take a bite and its just dry I happen to have cake from a French bakery I bought the same day in the morning thinking people might come to my house but instead I met up with them here I think that maybe something is wrong with my fridge causing the drying but the cake tarts cream puffs all tasted very fresh and bread felt fine from the other bakery I feel like I dont know what to say 14 for a slice that I threw in the trash Its not the cost its the principle I dont even know if this is something I should call and complain about and get a new slice I feel like I shouldnt get an old slice from a place like this If you order togo check your order I guess so it doesnt happen to you,negative,331,300- 500,1646,1500-2000
Maybe its been too long since ive had momofuku milk bar the first time i had it was in 2010 in NYC and i fell in love with the crack pie and the cereal milk soft serve I had raved about it to my bf and convinced him to come We came here after we ate at the noodle bar and we were sorely disappointed I got the breakfast cereal quake and it tasted like horolicks reminded me of a mcd mcflurry it was thick and similar to ice cream after a little bit it started tasting bland and overly sweet maybe the other flavors are better but i wouldnt get this one again My bf tried the cereal milk soft serve and he actually didnt like it The consistency was smooth it was a bit sweet and the corn flakes did nothing for him He didnt even have half before tossing it out While i was there i got the compost cookie and im glad that it still taste as great as it did before i do like that you can try the other various flavors such as lemon blueberry and chocolate chip marshmallow they were good but not as great as the compost cookie next time im back in vegas im not sure if ill get the soft serve but ill definitely be back for the cookies total 40,negative,231,200-250,1165,1000-1500
This place was totally not worth the trip  Donuts were dry and tasteless  They looked good but lacked in flavor And definitely overpriced,negative,25,<50,141,<500
I have to say the sun has surely set on Buddy Vs pastry empire I came here expecting amazing cannoli what Buddy V claims is a specialty of his on TV and what I got was a sloppy unauthentic and repulsive mess The filling was disgustingly sweet while the shell was bitter and rock hard I would expect some of the best cannoli in the world or so Buddy V would claim to have a subtly sweet filling and a flaky shell at the least I got none of these things Almost as if to mock my misfortune Carlos bakery charges in excess of 5 for this experience,negative,108,100-150,561,500-1000
Absolutely fantabulous I only had two things at this french bakery They were so good I kept on getting those two same things here 1 Turkey and cheese baquette toasted optional Comes on a walnut baquette with flavorful swiss cheese turkey and a sweet mustardlike spread I ate 4 of these one for every day I was there 2 Macarons So sad I discovered these late as I was always focused on 1 above They have choices such as lemon coffee chocolate and vanilla I got the vanilla pause Melt In Your Mouth So Delicously Amazing Macaron Where have you been all my life Ive always thought the term macaron were reserved only for those coconut dropball cookies but I learned from Eunice K that this term also applied for this hamburgershapped cookie sandwich filled with vanilla cream and coated with a light crunchy meringuelike coat If you are in for a quick breakfast or lunch Bouchon has quality pastries sandwiches coffee and tea for that togo meal you need Two big thumbs up from me Just a note its a stand around the corner from Grand Luxe Cafe in the Venetian Nothing fancy Just a stand that serves delicious bakery items Eat your baked goods fresh thats when they taste the best,positive,213,200-250,1238,1000-1500
Literally this is the best icecream you can eat in Ohio I tried Brpwnie Sandae and got a big bown for 65 I dont mean the price worth it No The price is surprisingly low for the quality and taste you get,positive,42,25-50,210,<500
We were so excited to eat desserts from Cake Boss Being in Vegas we thought we had our chance We ordered a wide varietystrawberry shortcake carrot cake confetti cake and Italian cheesecake The only thing that was delicious was the strawberry shortcake Everything else was dry and the taste ratios were off Frosting was way too sweet and and the cake tasted old Such a let down Sadly Im no longer excited to visit the original store out East due to our experience here 4 pieces of cake and 2 bottled waters were nearly 50 We didnt even finish the cakes and there were 6 of us Sorry Buddy you lost my repeat business,negative,114,100-150,637,500-1000
Honey Hut is good stuff Its perfect for the beach Their ice cream is so creamy and delicious and cheap but not overly sweet I could tell that they used pretty good ingredients I tried the fresh banana and mint with some friends delish Orange blossom sounds good too Read Lins review ,positive,53,50-75,296,<500
The service was excellent Walked in and was greeted immediately with kind welcoming people Their ice cream flavors were unique and extremely tasteful There was no limit to samples of ice cream as far as I was aware The menu can be a little intimidating but I recommend getting a scoop or two of an ice cream of your choice and then creating your own sundae with the wide variety of toppings they offer which range from being 50 or a 1 more For it being my first time I will definitely be going back,positive,95,75-100,508,500-1000
This place is awesome Do they have 300 flavors with 600 toppings No Thats probably why this place is so awesome I need to start out with something about the lady who was working Im assuming she was an owner or someone else deeply involved in the whole process and she was more than willing to fill us in on where the ingredients came from or any other details which she deemed necessary They mostly werent necessary but when you have someone that is that into what they are doing you gotta have some love for it Between the 4 of us we probably had 12 or so samples and we did so without a bad look or skip in the record of our servers in depth guide to the flavors I settled on the salted caramel ice cream which was phenomenal Silky smooth and buttery like a kobe bryant jump shot Its 9AM right now and my mouth is watering thinking about it There are so many flavors that you just generally would never see and as weird as they may seem they all taste great Next time in Scottsdale theres a good chance I will hopefully be able to visit this hot spot cool spot again,positive,208,200-250,1094,1000-1500
Oh my gosh these donuts are to die for Stopped in on my walk thru downtown Great concept gourmet donuts with a awesome atmosphere Try the soma donut cant go wrong any of their donuts,positive,35,25-50,192,<500

Because I enjoy watching the show on TV I was expecting an incomparable experience when tasting the products in the store I would have preferred the lobster tail dough to be softer however the cream filling was delicious with a touch of liqueur The cannoli was average and I expected the cup cakes a little more moist and soft Cheese cake flavor did not stand out from others Ive tried I liked half moon and chocolate butter cookies I also wanted chocolate covered strawberries but there were none for sale I feel you are definitely paying for celebrity and not flavor,negative,101,100-150,577,500-1000
Sprinkles has everything I love in an overpriced cupcake Their sugary moist slightly dense and made with quality ingreidents you can taste They offer an array of flavors and even have a killer vegan red velvet with frosting made with coconut oil Very well executed but I would have appreciated other options to choose from Grab them fresh from the store or give the cupcake ATM a try when an after hour craving hits,positive,74,50-75,424,<500
So the shop itself is super cute Its all pink with all sorts of sweets and such Feel free to walk in there and take a look however do NOT order from here Family and I walk in take a look at the menu and see the Flower Child So cute exclaim the little ones Yeah what we got was NOTHING like the picture As they were making it I already started questioning whether what was being made was what I ordered The scoops of ice cream went in the pot and completely disappeared in there Then the creams and syrups started getting added By the end some decorations were added to the cream and handed to me I blinked a few times too stunned to say anything So aside the fact that the Flower Child given to us bore no resemblance whatsoever to what was being advertised it also tasted terrible It was just overly sweet to put it mildly The thing is the service was decent The product being sold is not Youll have better luck going to the gelato shops nearby,negative,184,150-200,976,500-1000
I came here for a coworkers baby shower and could not have been more impressed with the space the food and the employees If youve never been beyond the pastry case in the front of this location you are missing out It extends so far back its hard to believe They have so many little nickknacks to look at youll never be bored I also didnt realize you could rent the place out Someone told me that it could hold a wedding party of 80 We only had the back rooms rented out for about 20 people and it was plenty of space Amelies provided quiche Lorraine which was wonderful as well as a spinach quiche their famous pastries coffee and orange juice I was so impressed with their food I took some home to my husband who took literally a bite out of everything because he couldnt decide what to eat,positive,152,150-200,814,500-1000
Ice cream is good but way too expensive I dont want to pay eight dollars for a damn sundae Plus the line is way too long and out the door The place is cute but really small Wouldnt recommend,negative,39,25-50,196,<500

Good vibes We went for ice cream this evening and we can say with all sincerity that it was a great experience I tried the cookiemint and the Vietnamese coffee and it was delicious My SO gitot the strawberry shortcake sundae and enjoyed it We would come here again for more ice cream ,positive,54,50-75,293,<500
Im glad that Sprinkles made its way to Las Vegas I first tried them in Phoenix and really enjoyed the taste of the cupcake Each day they carry about a dozen flavors with a couple that rotate Most of the flavors are standard like vanilla chocolate red velvet lemon and carrot The special flavors that are on rotation are more exciting like key lime meringue and margarita The rotating flavors are why I return The actual cakes are good The cake part is moist and delicious I like the flavor of the frosting and the amount of frosting on each cupcake I also like that they have a standard cupcake design with the simple sugar dot in the middle This location also has a cupcake ATM Awesome I get that they are just filling this from inside the building but its a novelty and I am easily amused by this novelty Of course this is how we opted to have our cupcake dispensed to us last time we visited It really fits in with the fun youthful vibe of The Linq,positive,181,150-200,976,500-1000
So with all the hype we decided to try Melt Tiny ice cream shop went on a Friday night the guy and girl working it werent very enthusiastic  looked like they didnt want to be there Ice cream was okay 6 for a double Started to melt quickly we wont be going back Should have gone to Sweet Republic,negative,60,50-75,308,<500

Ive been a fan of Carlo because of his show Cake Boss so I was pretty excited to try his pastries out in Vegas It is located inside of the Venetian across from his restaurant We got there on a Saturday night around 10 PM and there was only a small line so the wait was not too bad I would recommend not coming during this time because they were out of the two things I really wanted to try and their most popular items Lobster Tail and Canoli The selection was pretty limited at this time so I only got a California Cheesecake I orderpaid and then had to wait about 10 minutes to pickup my order I didnt really understand this because all they have to do is box the Cheesecake The cheesecake itself was alight but definitely not worth the price 11 at all I might come back to try the lobster tail and canolis but was not wowed at all by my first experience here,negative,169,150-200,878,500-1000
One of the best ice cream cones Ive ever had My husband and I have been to numerous ice cream places in the Phoenix area and this is by far our favorite I had a Buttermilk Tangerine that was AMAZING My husband had Madagascar Vanilla that he said was outstanding We cant wait to return Yum,positive,56,50-75,296,<500
You really cannot go wrong here No matter when you arrive there will probably be a wait so be prepared However it is so worth it They serve about 20 flavors of the best soft serve ice cream Their milkshakes are incredible Plus they have sooo many toppings If you want something different than the usual conemilkshake try one of their creations Think Nancy B cookie sundaes yummm I know this sounds crazy but their ice cream is so rich  creamy it doesnt melt right away which is amazing Cash only which is the only downfall I really feel this would speed up the line but hey whatever they are doing seems to work ATM on site Dont forget your dogs pup cup ,positive,125,100-150,678,500-1000
Disappointingly VERY POOR SERVICE Ordered bday cake 2 WEEKS in advance They accepted our order paid for the cake already called the day before scheduled pick up and they confirmed Lo and behold NO CAKE on day of pick up No manager present on site and poor resolution from the supervisor All they gave for disappointing a 5 year old on his bday is 4 off the bill,negative,68,50-75,371,<500
Great place with great service Its small and theres a line  but they kill it quick and the next thing you know youre on your way out Great service  great product Definitely coming back,positive,36,25-50,193,<500
I tried the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes and its delicious The corn flakes are lightly salted and they add a nice texture to the ice cream Its a little on the expensive size though One soft serve was 6 and to add the corn flakes was an additional 125 I also bought 3 cookies for 8 which I havent tried yet,positive,64,50-75,329,<500
I had a crack pie shake or whatever it was called It was crazily sweet way too sweet Something approaching drinking maple syrup My wife didnt like it I kind of did kind of didnt When I return to Vegas Ill be skipping this one Also a lot of money for a tiny shake though with Vegas prices i guess it makes sense,negative,63,50-75,326,<500
Four of us walked in and were greeted by no one Stood in line for 30 minutes with ONLY 1 party ahead of us and no one even acknowledged us With 6 visible employees there is no reason why we should have experienced thiswe ended us leaving empty handed Wish I knew if the cupcakesice cream was even good,negative,59,50-75,309,<500
Stopped here to get some cupcakes and was surprised at how much I liked them Ive been by several times just to pick up a cupcake from the ATM for dessert I went inside once and the line was kind of crazy so the ATM works great The only downside is that the ATM gets used a lot and sometimes they are out of certain flavors I like the strawberry and peanut butter cupcakes the best The cupcakes are moist and I find the more traditional flavors to be the tastiest I tried a couple of the fancier flavors and wasnt too impressed while my wife really liked them They also have ice cream inside and cupcakes for your dog and there are also tables and chairs outside to sit I tried a cookie from the ATM and found the price and taste to be not so good Ill stick to the cupcakes I could see my wallet having a heart attack if I bought a whole dozen given the price of the cupcakes however just stopping by for a cupcake or 2 for dessert makes it more justifiable and the fact that they taste better than the average cupcake makes its worth it,positive,204,200-250,1051,1000-1500
I went there today for the first time I told the one worker that I was new She seemed annoyed that she had to explain which donut was what Maybe if they had signs or descriptions it would help eliminate the annoyance of everyone asking whats that The donuts were good but honestly I wasnt blown away My husband and I tried the glazed Samoan maple PB lucky charms They might have been fresh but I dont think they were The lucky charm one especially Just seemed like it was sitting around awhile The donut dough itself is thick and more like a cake I was hoping the glazed one would top Krispie Kream but two totally different tastes They are not light and airy All in all very good donuts the concept is cool just feel like the hype makes it more than what it is,negative,147,100-150,785,500-1000
Delicious ice cream and so fun to watch it being made I love that they use local and organic ingredients as much as possible slightly healthier junk food right And its great that they have dry ice so we can buy quarts to take home,positive,45,25-50,238,<500
I went in and ordered a peanut butter cookie and 5 of the smaller cookies that they had on top of the counter and all I can say is that they were all lacking flavor The small cookies on top of the counter were way too thick I felt like while lacking flavor I didnt try anything else but I doubt it would be good Honestly I thought I could buy better cookies at Publix,negative,75,50-75,378,<500
The most amazing ice cream EVER I grew up outside of Youngstown OH where the company originated from Moving out to Las Vegas made me miss the best of the best from back east But long behold Handels is finally here The ice cream is dead on from Ohio So many flavors to try but I can never get past by favorites Try the malted chocolate peanut butter or the salted caramel truffle You may want to pass up the scoop and opt for a quart because it is that good Staff is super friendly and the owner is totally awesome Keep up the great work Handels Ill see you real soon,positive,112,100-150,585,500-1000
Great little spot for a quick sweet treat or your caffeine fix while on the busy Vegas Strip Very pleasant  helpful staff Nice quaint little patio seating on the outside the perfect area to read a book or people watch all day long,positive,44,25-50,234,<500
Coffee was fine both the decaf and the regular We had lavender with pistachio cake and chocolate cake Both were made days ago I think they were not fresh and both taste similarly Specially the chocolate cake had little cocoa powder it was more like food color red For this quality they were pricy 6 per slice Coffee was 35,negative,60,50-75,336,<500
Kinda a bit of a sellout Prepackage And 650 for a piece on crack pie in a box like you would get it at McDonalds No impressed at all And 52 for the whole pie WTF  Not impressed at all Seems almost like a get rich quick scheme Was so excited to try this place and was a total let down,negative,62,50-75,298,<500
So hopeful when they were doing the Red Velvet cupcake drive so I got the RV It was dry and too light and frankly small for the price  The top separated when I was peeling off the paper This is your specialty so you should have the best The set up was also confusing Much better choices for the money,negative,61,50-75,307,<500
Stopped in here after dinner on Saturday Spent quite a bit of time talking to the owner Nice guy The best cannoli we have found since we moved here from NY Cream puffs were great Had something weve never had before called a lobster tail Not up our alley The almond crinkle  is amazing Cant wait for more,positive,59,50-75,323,<500

I was excited when I saw they have a Sprinkles that made ice cream but the clerk at the register had no knowledge of how anything was made so I ended up just getting a cupcake The lady behind me ordered and why did he assume we were together and put our cupcakes in the same box We said no were separate then he said we charge for separate boxes that doesnt make sense to me got back to eat my cupcake and it was crumbly and dry smh,negative,89,75-100,442,<500

I ordered a cake for my dads birthday from this establishment I was so excited about it because since moving to Charlotte everyone has ranted and raved about this place It was far from satisfying I ordered their strawberry vanilla type cake It had some fancy name and the ingredients also sounded super fancy so I ordered it I ordered it to serve 6 people They suggested getting one that severed up to 10 people so I did It costed about 35 and I ordered it to be picked up on a Friday On Wednesday I called to see if I could get it a day early and they said that most likely wasnt possible but they would try and call me if they could I never got a call thats fine I ordered it for Friday so that was my doing Well when I picked it up it looked amazing Beautiful and delicious Well not the case Once we sang happy birthday and my dad blew out the candles we cut into it The icing fell off as if it had been frozen for a few days on there The cake was dry so dry as in my mom has to mix in vanilla ice cream that we had to make it less dry I was so disappointed I was thinking of calling and complaining but I didnt because I dont like to complain But I felt the need to write a review Maybe they made the cake early and left it in the freezer or maybe their cakes are dry and flavorless I dont know but I wont be going back,negative,273,250-300,1352,1000-1500
Not what you would expect after watching the show rather have went to trader joes and got dessert,negative,18,<50,97,<500
Ive been a Jenis fan for a long time I used to get it a lot when I lived in Chicago so I was stoked when they opened one in CLT right after I moved here As with other locations the inside is bright and inviting and they have awesome flavors Really I have yet to try a bad one but my favorites recently are the gooey butter cake and cream puff The cream puff might actually be my favorite ice cream of all time This location can get busy but the line moves quickly The staff are friendly and happy to let you try any flavors I know people think Jenis is expensive but nowadays I feel like any quality ice cream is I also think the Jenis portions are very generous so that helps with the price I always get the standard 2 half scoops for 5 and honestly its enough that I could share it with my husband instead of each getting our own cone but wheres the fun in that right Theres a lot of street parking around this location and its the perfect spot to grab an ice cream and walk around,positive,197,150-200,1012,1000-1500
This is my favorite ice cream shop in DC Great flavors and excellent customer service,positive,15,<50,87,<500

One of the best donuts in Cleveland They specialize in their presentation but dont let the pictures scare you off if you are into plain glazed These are my favorite glazed donuts around Perfectly fluffy with just the right amount of glaze Goes great with a cup of coffee If you are feeling adventurous they even have bacon maple Something here for everyone They have both cake and raised donuts its hard to tell what they are under the toppings so make sure you get what you want If something is missing dont be afraid to ask sometimes they have more in the back,positive,104,100-150,580,500-1000

I was excited to try this place as I live in the east coast and havent managed to get to the original in NYC yet I tried the crack soft serv it wasnt great Friends had the cereal and birthday cake milkshakes What we learned its really hard to suck frozen cornflakes out of a straw even if the straw is really heavy duty I also bought cookies to take home and the chocolate cookie was very bitter The cornflake chocolate marshmallow wasnt too bad All in all this was disappointing and expensive Too bad,negative,95,75-100,518,500-1000
So this place legit earns all of its amazing reviews Really fun eclectic interior from both the furniture to the chandeliers But the main showpiece is obviously the treats It was hard to pick only two things but the almond tea cake and the raspberry lemon tart were both to die for Handsdown everything you would expect and then some With some good coffee youll feel like youre in Paris even if just for a few minutes,positive,77,75-100,429,<500
I eat at Handels almost everyday I get salted caramel in a sugar cone which is delicious I have to say if it wasnt so good or there was another one closer I would stop going to this one Salted Caramel is a really soft ice cream I would think for 400 a scoop they could give you a cup on top especially when it is 108 outside They want to charge 25 extra How much could a cup cost 01 Terrible owner not nice,negative,85,75-100,421,<500

Ice cream was good Hot fudge was over cooked and stuck together in chunky globs instead of being soft and in liquid form Also the mask policy on the front door references outdated CDC guidance from May CDC updated their guidance three weeks ago on July 27 Since then 300 Arizonas have died and thousands of others have clogged up our hospitals and contracted long COVID What will it take for you to update your sign and policy to align with the new CDC guidance,negative,85,75-100,468,<500

Definitely a disappointment If i could rate less than one star i would The cupcake had no real flavor The ice cream thats brought in daily from Beverly Hills tasted just like grocery store ice cream The worst  I have spent by far in quite a while I am not exactly sure what the whole allure of this place is after visiting Will not be recommending guests to go here,negative,71,50-75,377,<500

Oh Carlos bakery you have lost your identity Came in on a Saturday around noon to satisfy my east coast cravings and there were NO BLACK AND WHITE COOKIES LOBSTER TAILS or TIRAMISU Originally came in looking for rainbow cookies and ended up leaving highly dissatisfied Dense and stale no flavor whatsoever This place is a sad excuse for a bakery that has simple treats that you can find anywhere else A major disappointment and just another west coast bakery charging premium prices for average cannolis and fresh baked sugar cookies I didnt come here for the name I came here for the classic baked goods You go in with high hopes of an Italian east coast bakery and leave feeling unsatisfied and disappointed,negative,124,100-150,723,500-1000
I was so happy to know that the bakery was in my hotel What a disappointment I went there to get something for my birthday I got the red velvet cupcake and the creampuff lobster tail The red velvet cup cake was very salty and the lobster tail was stale was not even flaky at all My husband had the vanilla cupcake and he said it was all right it was and all that Very disappointed,negative,76,75-100,388,<500

Had really high expectations from this brand name being a die hard fan of Buddy Valastrobut was so heartbroken and disappointed not once but twice with their products Cannoli had a grainy cream filling with soggy pastry Lobster tails were chewy and almost took 1 min to eat one bite and also the filling was stinky Hazelnut puff had a nice filling but yet again the pastry was horribly wet n soggy Lemon puffs were nice with a good amount of filling and decent pastry Cupcakes were dry and frosting was like the storebought sugar creams,negative,96,75-100,547,500-1000
We all know about Bouchonat least us Bay Area folks do and this review is not for the food but for the ASS service and ASS latte i got here yesterday morning for the lovely price of 525 The bread is slamming but seriously learn to make a fucking decent latte When someone asks for extra foam and you give them a latte with NO Foam and said person says I asked for foam and your reaction is to pour out 14 of the latte to ADD foam you best realize you are pouring out the ESPRESSO I paid for They were not happy that I told then to remake the whole thing but for serious learn to make a fucking latte  Upping to 25 stars Lovely husband went down this am and got a triple shot latte for me with extra foam and it was better not great Maybe it is because he is cuter than me,negative,159,150-200,795,500-1000

this quaint cake shop is perfect for everything from afternoon tea with friends to dessert after a night out in lawrenceville tucked away and easy to miss the Butterwood Bake Consortium offers deliciously succulent and thick slices of cake with an assortment of creative and fresh tasting flavors the prices are high 6 for a slice but youre getting a huge slice easily shared by two that is rich and decadent without weighing you down they have other pastries if youre not a cake person and have a variety of vegan options too having worked previously in pastry kitchens i can attest this is some of the best cake ive ever had the space is small but even when its busy you can usually find a space to sit and chat and the atmosphere is pleasant without being too loud wifi is available cell service was spotty inside but this is more of a hangout spot than a study spot staff are friendly and helpful though service can slow down a bit at peak times when the line gets long when my friend was disappointed that someone in front of us got the last slice of chocolate cake we were eyeing the staff made sure to go check if there was another similar one in the back even though it was late in the evening thankfully there was an espresso chocolate cake its a cute place with delicious treats definitely not to be missed,positive,244,200-250,1346,1000-1500
The pastries are delicious but not enough to make up for the awful service While we were being helped the lady at the pastry case talked to me a 23 year old very condescending and was rude My boyfriend was astonished the way that I was talked to Will not be returning,negative,52,50-75,272,<500
YUM I tried the cannoli lobster tail  crumb cake To be honest the crumb cake was very very hard like a brick But the others were very tasty As for the line we only had to wait about 10 minutes We came around 4pm on a Saturday today The workers were also very friendly and talkative so that was nice ,positive,62,50-75,312,<500
the most beautiful donuts I have ever seenyet very dry and actually dont even taste like donutsI can only assume the high stars are because the donuts are unusual and prettyI had the strawberry split I think thats what it was called crÃme brÃlÃe and the blueberry pop tartthe strawberry donut was the driest of them all but I think they figured the whip cream would help it out yet it didntthe crÃme brÃlÃe was hard on the top like all the reviews said but the donut again had no flavor and what I thought was going to be airy turned out to be hard and chewythe blueberry pop tart donut was the most disappointing with what tasted like canned blueberry filling and was completely inconsistent throughout the centervery disappointing since I had such high hopes for this placehowever I did give it two stars because the donuts are beautiful,negative,150,100-150,876,500-1000
Such a cute bakery We have traveled past it several times and finally stopped They have TONS of options We couldnt decide what to get so we bought a ton and made our own little sampler I loved they had gluten free options The people there are super nice The girl that was helping out was super nice but I think she was new and so it took a little longer for us to get out but was totally not an issue since it was a Sunday and had no where to go,positive,93,75-100,454,<500
Omg I am in town for a day and went to the other location for a late lunch and loved it Had to come to this 247 location to eat more deliciousness before I skip town tomorrow This location has a smaller seating area and it was ridiculously crowded at midnight on a Tuesday night Had their veggie quiche which was AMAZING I wish I wore loose pants so I could eat another helping Im getting withdrawals already Also had the apple tart which was divine Had their chicken salad sandwich which wasnt too mayonnaisey and their yummy cream puff Their passion fruit strawberry lemonade was a bit too limonadey Their green tea pineapple drink was refreshing Will definitely come back when Im back in town,positive,126,100-150,711,500-1000
Made a quick stop in Bouchon Bakery as we were walking around the Strip Suddenly a craving for a macaron was upon me  who am I to argue such a sugarypull Got the Pistachio  it was hard  chewy  no tender pillow of deliciousness Disappointed Mr got the Banana Walnut Muffin  it was stale Dry  tasted old he threw over 12 of it away Maybe if we had been to the larger bakery inside the Venetian we might have fared better but this little kiosk at the clock tower has been neglected Sadness,negative,98,75-100,509,500-1000
My husband ordered a sundaeeasy right HA He said worst sundae he has ever had  I tried it an agree The ice cream was tasteless  the hot fudge congealed to the ice cream and was almost solid in texture not hot  creamy At the prices at this place they should be embarrassed,negative,55,50-75,282,<500
I dont get the hype I took Hunnie Bunnie here for a treat so we could both try out the new cupcake in town I wasnt impressed I didnt know there was a cupcake schedule so the cupcakes I actually wanted to order werent available on Friday We opted for Red Velvet and the Black and White No bells and whistles went off for me and at almost 4 a pop I should have experienced SOMETHING I would like to go back and try the Carrot Cake though and see if thats any better since thats what I originally wanted to try but Im not a fan of their frosting at all I dont find it soft enough or sweet enough I havent been to the Cupcakery in YEARS but I can still remember how indulgent and AMAZING their cupcakes were especially compared to this place,negative,146,100-150,760,500-1000
Very mediocreits all just hype from the show I was so excited to try their lobster tail after watching the show and was so disappointed The cream inside was good but the pastry itself was so hard and dry They were also out of half the pastries Did I also mention that the lobster tail was 7 Save your money and go to any other bakery than this place I still love the show and am happy to say that I dont need to try his pastries anymore,negative,88,75-100,451,<500

Complete shambles Waited in line for ice cream for 20 minutes No ice cream is worth that but when I got to order I found out half the flavors were sold out and I didnt want any of the other flavors that were left The staff member managing the line with menus could have told me when I joined the line  I then went to the gheridellis store across from sprinkles and got some tasty ice cream Id recommend doing that,negative,82,75-100,425,<500
Really unhappy with my experience the guy was nice that worked there but the ice cream selection isnt the best And their prices to their portion sizes are ridiculous I got a double scoop with a marshmallow and Oreos and it was 11 which I would not mind if it came with a decent amount I got the SMALLEST AMOUNT OF ICE CREAM I will never go back,negative,68,50-75,351,<500
I was in town for a business trip and stayed in the hotel nearby It was hot and I wanted something cool and fresh The moment I walked into the store I was greeted immediately by a young lady behind the counter Everything on the menu looks really good and I finally decided to go for Shrimp Avocado Crepe with the help of the young lady Even though it was pretty busy but I got my crepe in just a few minutes The avocado is just right and the shrimp is crispy the flavor is delicious and the setting is very comfortable Overall I am impressed with my experience They deserve a thumbs up,positive,114,100-150,597,500-1000

I literally cannot stop laughing about this place I mean the sheer audacity of Brandon and Jenny Douglas to serve such unapologetically sinful desserts like this is just beyond comprehension Warm donuts stuffed with ice cream Waffle ice cream sandwiches With cereal toppings And a variety of glass bottled soda offerings To those grossed out by this boldness you might as well leave this review now Me I just had to see this for myself After a soft opening in early March I went to the Grand Opening Saturday night appropriately enough the same weekend as Art Detour Located on Grand Avenue  Fillmore in the same complex as ThirdSpace Novel occupies the red building in back that has seen a number of concepts come and go over the years but none with such an eye popping slogan out front as Ice Cream Stuffed Donuts Downtown Phoenix is certainly a friendly breeding ground for entrepreneurial experimentation but could something this crazy actually work Brandon and Jenny were delightful from the moment I walked in the door and you can pick up on just how passionately devoted they are to their bold new concept The ice cream flavors are made to their own specs the donuts and waffles are made fresh in house and theyll pretty much let you sample as many flavors as you want With bold flavors like Bourbon Caramel Toffee Crunch Cookie Monster and Panna Cotta Cherry as well as more familiar offerings like Butter Pecan Madagascar Vanilla and Mint I counted 14 different flavor offerings this go around If the ice cream and pastry combination wasnt crazy enough did I mention toppings From cereals Youve got options like Captain Crunch Cookie Crisp Fruity Pebbles Fruit Loops and even Cocoa Puffs I was craving a waffle this go around so for me tonight would be a date with me and the Leslie Knope And yes that is an entirely intentional reference to Amy Poehlers character on Parks  Rec Two fresh made waffles with ice cream and a topping in the middle My kryptonite of choice Honey Lavender ice cream and Cinnamon Toast Crunch Normally 5 tonight it was discounted at 3 for the grand opening though I wouldve happily paid 5 for this magic After a few minutes it was put together and placed in wax paper for sandwich style portability The first bite had me filled with thoughts that I should maybe be remorseful for this obscene creation but no no I was not remorseful at all Lets pretend calorie and cholesterol numbers dont count and Ill instead just tell you this is really good for you and it will make you happy Add Novel to the growing list of great restaurants dotting the landscape on Downtowns Grand Avenue food scene including Treehouse Bakery Irmas Kitchen and Barrio Cafe Gran Reserva In addition to donuts and waffles stuffed with ice cream and toppings they offer soda floats traditional ice cream scoops on a waffle or pretzel cone and even an ice cream flight of 5 flavors And not a single item on the menu is more expensive than 8 Novel might leave you laughing about what youve just done to your diet or embarrassed to admit what youve eaten but I think youll find the mixed emotions worth the trouble It may be early in Brandon and Jennys fledgling concept but from what I can see theyve hit on a winner,positive,575,500+,3314,2000+
On vacay in Vegas and in search of a delicious cupcake so I was thrilled to see that Sprinkles was just down the promenade outside the Linq Hotel The shop is small and cute the display is adorable but the cupcake was terrible dry and crumbly with a hardened glob of frosting on top Based on the texture it would be better described as tough vanilla cornbread topped with sugar paste And there was a clump of coconut balled up on top that tasted like sand It was sooooo bad The taste literally made me want to go back and get a refund I couldnt even get any takers for it in a room full of kids so I just tossed it in the bin and chalked it up as a loss The receipt actually had a BOGO offer on it redeemable the next day but I didnt want to roll the dice and get another 395 piece of cornbread When you enter this bakery the founder is staring back at you from the cover of her cupcake recipe book display AND shes my fave judge on Cupcake Wars so Sprinkles Bakery needed to bring it Unfortunately Ive had better cupcakes from Costco Hopefully it was just an off day for them but still a bummer I had a Snickers for dessert instead sigh,negative,224,200-250,1167,1000-1500

I was so excited to see this since I always see it on tiktok and boy was I disappointed I ordered the cake and shake combo and soft serve The line was long and they had celebrities that came plastered on the fridge I got the birthday cake and crunchy cereal shake The taste was so strange to me Like sour in a way Like sour cream and I was so weirded out by the flavor of the ice cream and shake The shake had crunchy bits of cereal but didnt mask that sour note The cake was frozen and moist but the icing was too much and very sweet I was expecting it to be light a bit But really it taste like those cheap birthday cakes you get at the grocery store The over sweet icing really killed it for me For their price point That is nuts Prob not gonna give in on hype next time,negative,159,150-200,796,500-1000

Things go fast so make sure you arrive early to ensure you get the best selection because once theyre out theyre out On our first visit we got here around 8am and there was a good amount of people in line to get donuts They had everything from creative choices like their version of a PopTart a variety of sugary cartoon characters jelly donuts and their take on the classic cake creations The problem with going first thing in the morning is that your eyes are bigger than your stomach and you end up ordering a ton Totally worth it Nothing beats remembering you have a box of these treats in your hotel room after a day of drinking or whatever it is you do in Vegas If you come around 11am which has been the case on most of our visits they box up the remaining donuts from the morning and sell them for 10 a pop You dont get to choose but its still a steal if you dont care which ones you get They also have variations of Stumptown Coffee if you need a caffeine boost Its offered in hot and cold forms but the cold brew is my favorite between the two especially if youre going during the warmer months Plenty of metered parking on the street and behind the building in a shared lot If you want to sit and eat they have some counter space inside and a shared outdoor area with some tables and chairs too Totally recommend if you havent had a chance to check them out in San Diego Theyre awesome,positive,270,250-300,1436,1000-1500

Stood in line for about 7mins to place the order then you wait for another 57mins when your name is called to pickup your order There are no prices anywhere you must ask for the prices when placing your order Dont wait to go and pay to find out the prices are outrageous like I did The cake was okay not worth 10 for a slice ONE SLICE It didnt taste much different than getting a slice of cake from Vons or Walmart Save your money and time,negative,88,75-100,455,<500
Totally disappointing given the hype Cereal milk soft serve 6 had a creamy smooth texture but faint flavor A small slice of Crack pie 650 was cold mushy and just plain sweet Everything is prepackaged other than coffee and soft serve which sets the perception that it is not all that fresh,negative,52,50-75,303,<500
The ice cream dude wanted me to have the caramel cashew My mom and I stopped in When I step up to order the guy says caramel cashew And Im like no and I order my coffee ice cream scoops and my moms chocolate fudge 5 scooper What do I get the caramel cashew men have such poor listening skills Why do I look so caramel cashewy It wasnt bad dont get me wrong I didnt complain so my bad I was mostly creeped out when he called me by name after looking at my credit card so I didnt want to point out his mistake When my mom mentioned we used to go to the old location he said I think I remember you so fake because we havent been there in 15 years I really hate to complain about an ice cream store like damn I also hate puppies and rainbows,negative,153,150-200,784,500-1000
I have had several good experiences at Chocolate Shoppe and I appreciate that they have vegan options However I was quite disappointed during my last visit First I ordered a vegan milkshake with ultimate oreo soy and peanut butter peanut butter was one of the listed topping options and I have gotten a shake with peanut butter at that location before When I got my shake it didnt look like it had any peanut butter so I asked the employee if they included the peanut butter and they said the peanut butter cups and I said I actually ordered peanut butter and I dont think the peanut butter cups are vegan The employee looked at me like I was an idiot and said its confusing but we dont have peanut butter I guess I can remake it without the peanut butter cups but no peanut butter and slammed it down on the counter I said no thanks Id actually like to switch to a scoop of the raspberry nebula soy in a pretzel cone and the employee said well the pretzel cone has dairy in it this is contrary to what Ive been told in the past and Im pretty sure the employee who told me that it was vegan had checked the ingredients list so Im interested to know what the correct answer is I was so disappointed in the service I received that I decided to leave without getting anything what a bummer,negative,245,200-250,1336,1000-1500
We decided to give this place a try after looking at the reviews but especially after the pictures After I got my order I was not impressed I ordered an affogato and it was good but definitely not worth the price or hype Others in my group ordered the gelato and were not pleased as well For that price I would rather go to a Coldstones or Creamistry I mustve had high expectations for this place and may be the reason why the disappointment was monumental,negative,86,75-100,467,<500

If you want to spend a lot of money on a gross shake this is the place for you This is one of those places that invents novelty treats and then because their treat is unique they dont have any problem overcharging for it Sadly while many places can actually pull it off Milk as a snack bar doesnt even skim close,negative,62,50-75,322,<500
This is a cupcake atm Its attached to a real ass bakery so you know theyre made within a day or so but the ATM is open 24 hours so the mechanics of it are truly baffling to me We went at about 8pm after the bakery was closed and there was no line at all The cupcake itself was good the cake was moist and the frosting wasnt so sickly sweet that it made the whole thing hard to eat which is the downfall of most cupcake shops There was also a pretty decent selection if I recall correctly it was about 12 or 15 flavors Coming to this is really more for the experience of getting a cupcake out of an ATM than because the pastry is so amazing but I still think its definately worth a stop you have to walk past it on the way to the High Roller so Id recommend stopping on the way back from that,positive,163,150-200,810,500-1000
Okay so everyone loves to come here and work It is either quiet enough or has a low noise volume to the point where it is so pleasant to come in and work on your laptop It is hard to find a space to work but once you find it you can at least get cozy with your coffee and food There is something here for everyone I love the mochas and the macaroons My go to is the mixed berry tart or the pecan tart,positive,86,75-100,409,<500

A little over hyped but indulgent nonetheless The grilled cheese was sinfully delicious and the other goodies were definitely full of sugar Everything youd expect from a donut shop The kid freebies were a nice Elmoy touch which I appreciate since the tab can get up there Enjoyed the visit and worth a stop if your driving by,positive,58,50-75,332,<500
Yesterday was my third time trying out more of their pastries and yesterday wAs my last I gave this place more tries than they deserved because to me their pastries are not sweet enough for my liking and second the customer service yesterday set the tone for me not coming back So I tried two flavors of their macarons yesterday for the first time one strawberry lemonade and the other was passion fruit Once I walked right out I wanted to try it because Macarons are actually my favorite dessert that I really enjoy But unfortunately the first bite was hard as a rock I couldnt even bite into it That being said I immediately went back it no big deal I was thinking I could easily exchange it for another flavor that was freshly made Well that where I was told by one of their employee that its supposed to be really hard and that they were made fresh that day smh Its the lies and tell a customer they are wrong is what made them lose a customer I had to tell two young boys working that shift that its not a big deal to me that I would be okay with exchanging the flavor out eventually he did but why did I have to explain myself for one piece of 250 macarons I could of easily said you know what since this is a big deal I will just like to return my entire order including my cheese cake and request a refund and walked out But I did not want to make a big deal out of nothing Lesson learned,negative,274,250-300,1423,1000-1500
It was just okay I had been to the Bouchon Bakery in NYC which was great so I had high expectations The pastries werent memorable and there wasnt really a place to sit except for around the corner in the food court I would go back to Jean Philipe at the Bellagio over this Bouchon Bakery,negative,56,50-75,294,<500
Worst visit in 8 years Nothing in the cabinet and very behind Amelies has always had bins full and plenty of backup Not sure what happened but what a wasteful trip,negative,31,25-50,168,<500
Went in to get our favorite lobster tails All orders are to go due to COVID so we had to find somewhere to sit and eat We have had Carlos lobster tails a few times and look forward to eating these when we visit Vegas My husband and I were very disappointed  They were so old and stale that each of us took 23 bites and we threw all three we purchased out Not only were we disappointed but it was a waste of money In addition there is always a premium in Vegas I suppose we could have walked back to ask for our money back but we were headed in the opposite direction and did not have the spare time to head back I have to say that the staff was very pleasant and did their best to direct us to the nearest seating Quality was seriously disappointing though,negative,152,150-200,769,500-1000
If you love ice cream youll love Handels They have an array for flavors that are all homemade They are a take out only restaurant The line is always so long but so worth the wait We always get the sampler whichs includes 4 scoops for 5 So far their banana foster is my all time fave but Ive also never had anything I didnt like there,positive,67,50-75,347,<500
I dont understand the hype or the line for this place Wanted some late night dessert and was intrigued by the concept of a 15 milkshake like how John Travoltas character in Pulp Fiction wanted to taste Uma Thurmans 5 shake These are fancy shakes because they have alcohol in them Great I like alcohol and sweets None of the shake combos sounded like what I wanted so I asked if they could make a peppermint bark shake with the creme de menthe and creme de cocoa they use in their fancy hot chocolates Nope They cant I really dont know why this would be a problemthey have all of the ingredients right there There was no line so its not like this experiment would cause a back up So anyway now Ive got peppermint bark on my mind so I forgo the alcohol and get a peppermint bark milkquake It was okay Very minty and not enough chocolate for it to really seem like peppermint bark And why are there pretzels in it I specifically ordered the peppermint bark version and not the peppermint pretzel version because that doesnt sound like a good combo to me and I was right I also got a compost cookie because I looooove cookies with lots of stuff in them I had it warmed up and it was dry and crumbly with not enough contrast between the different elements in it That was really disappointingespecially after paying 4 for it Didnt finish it All I can figure is people these days must not bake themselves or their mamas dont bake Because I dont know why else anyone would be impressed by this,negative,279,250-300,1540,1500-2000
Im lactose intolerant and this place has it all You wont be disappointed by their attention to detail either as these sweets are almost too cool to nom on,positive,29,25-50,158,<500
Great customer service I ordered a Oreo flavor cone today Everything seems alright until I finished half way and found a tissue inside my ice cream I think I have swallowed a few piecesI thought it was oatmeal at first,negative,40,25-50,231,<500
Like In N Out they have seriously long lines Their icecream is slooooooooo good Love their chocolate chip cookies It just melts in your mouth Their Sprinkles Cupcake ATM machine is ingenious We need these machines everywhere,positive,37,25-50,231,<500
Im so disappointed at their customer service I had other friends tell me of their bad experiences but I never had anything bad to say about this place I still think their desserts are great but if the customers are being treated so horribly for asking a question and placing an order who will buy those delicious desserts Im so horrified by my experience and the way I was treated by one of their employees that I am so hesitant to go back to buy a piece of cake If you can look pass that and ignore the rudeness of others please try it out Following is my comment on their Instagram Delicious desserts Any time we have family over we always order from this bakery My kids love their cheesecake and almost every week we get desserts from here Unfortunately their employees are extremely rude and have 0 idea of what customer service is My family and Ive been loyal customers since last year and really want this local bakery to succeed during these hard times but I was shocked the way I was treated by one of their employees cant remember the name either Cory or Jacob on Saturday evening when I took my guests to get some dessert The owners are good people and they care so much about their employees and I know this because I had a conversation with Paul Villani regarding a special order I placed in December and how he was so genuine and caring towards his employees I hope their employees would care just as much about them Honestly I care so much about their business and truly love this place I still tipped the guy 15 after his disgraceful and humiliating comments I wish you all the best Paul  Amanda Villani but I will not be coming to your bakery any more until you show the same care and genuineness to your customers as you do for your employees You lost a loyal customer,negative,334,300- 500,1818,1500-2000
Do not go to this place unless you are ready to be disappointed Me and my husband came to this place in hopes that I would find a sfogliatella Normally they are a very very nice size as being a brooklynite I was expecting the nice size What I got wasnt even the size of my hand It was small extremely stale They didnt even bother to put powdered sugar on the pastry I was sooo upset that I spent that money on it Next the lines arent bad but the disorganization is a joke we had been waiting for our order for about 15 minutes and our order was two sfogliatella and two canolli Which by the way was also horrible not what I had expected from a place like this because hes world famous Fix your business buddie its really horrible I will never step a foot back in this place sad but true,negative,156,150-200,808,500-1000
I feel like this place is a novelty with very bad and overpriced desserts I got a crack pie soft serve with cereal sprinkles as a topping It was sweet more sweet and even more sweet It was so sweet I felt like I was going to become a diabetic just from eating a tiny cup of soft serve I ate probably two spoons and had to stop eating I threw away the rest as it was just way too sweet to eat A friend behind me in line tasted my soft serve and decided not to order anything  that was a wise decision I also ordered a cornflake chocolate chip cookies which was just like the soft serve sweet sweet and more sweet The cookies were already prepackaged in bags and Im not sure whether they are actually made on site I asked for the cookie to be heated which essentially meant they stuck it in the microwave for a couple seconds It wasnt actually heated nearly enough Oh and did I mention that a tiny tiny cup of soft serve cost you six bucks and a sprinkle of serial cost an extra two bucks Totally not worth it Go somewhere else,negative,204,200-250,1053,1000-1500
Overall a good establishment I like the food the drinks are good but the reason this place sucks is because of the wait The line will take forever because they keep their bakery understaffed,positive,34,25-50,195,<500
Love their sticky pecan buns and cotton candy macaroons mousse cups are delicious I love this place,positive,17,<50,100,<500
Sorry to say it was not the best or the moistest cupcake I was very disappointed I took one bite and its still sitting on the counter my 7 year old granddaughter didnt even want it with the sprinkles and all not a fan at this time maybe I will give it another try when Im back in town,negative,59,50-75,288,<500
Service was friendly and quick but these are absolutely not the best donuts ever While they were beautifully presented once we bit into them we noticed how dry and unexceptional that they are The hype really falls short at this establishment which is really disappointing for how expensive these donuts are,negative,51,50-75,313,<500
Its fast and it also has good service The workers their are polite they do it fast and Nicely done They have any flavors you can think of But I have to warn you some of the time it is pretty crowded its all worth it they even give you samples when you want to try the flavor you picked If you want they even have shakes and you can watch them make there homemade ice cream because there is a glass window of there factory,positive,86,75-100,430,<500
Good product BUT owner is not very nice Not friendly not welcoming  makes u wait  the window even if theres no customer His employees are nice though I use to go  least 3 times a week  referred many people but after so many chances I stopped going,negative,51,50-75,257,<500
well known for their cakes and pastries but what s disappointing experience The line was long and just when you reach to make your order they get your order completely wrong It was too long of a line plus too long on waiting for my order Everything was sealed and package nicely but to my horror it was not what I had ordered Very disappointed that I could not taste what I had wanted,negative,74,50-75,392,<500
A good bakery but a little overrated in my opinion More of a cult following than not I believe,negative,19,<50,99,<500
Start off I saw the slice cakes in the vending machine in the Harrahs casino in the lobbyThe cost for a slice cake is 900 I told my husband lets just go to the bakery so I can see the bakery myself  Its cute more selection is nice I got myself 2 cupcakes 1 chocolate fudge and 1vanilla cupcake with white icing That cost 7 and some change I made a statement to the cashier wow for 7they must be good cupcakes Smh that was the sign because he didnt even say anything Shoot I got back to my room just to eat a stale cupcake If you in the Las Vegas area this is not your spot unless you want high end Stale Cupcakes That is a shame I am wondering if the slice cakes in the machine are past due date and stale too,negative,147,100-150,728,500-1000
Amazing I visited my friend in Scottsdale over the weekend and she took me here Now Im craving it hope to return in the near future Such unique fresh flavors Also the owner is super awesome  friendly,positive,38,25-50,211,<500
Over rated bakery do not let the hype fool you this place is trash I mean super duper trash I got the cannolis bruh they taste like chalk and powder I mean its super nasty and way over priced Everything I mean everything is over priced and so trash Do not go here please read the reviews first dont waste your money like me This place is ass,negative,68,50-75,347,<500
Love this place Cute retro feel super friendly and helpful staff and amazing ice cream My favorite is cookies and mint but they change out their flavors pretty frequently Last time I was in they had buttermilk grapefruit which was awesome Totally reminds me of one of the crazy flavor combos at Allegro Tucson gelato place,positive,56,50-75,332,<500
Love this place They really do have the best Chocolate Cannolis in Little Italy They also offer a wide variety of Italian baked goods as well as other food such as pizza sandwiches and salads I have also seen people doing work on their laptops here as well but I dont know how productive that you would be since this place is usually very busy Parking is a bit hard to find since it is street parking and personally Ive only ever walked to this place from my apartment This place is perfect for an afternoon catch up with a friend or a coffee date Check out this place if youre ever in Little Italy,positive,115,100-150,610,500-1000
Through high school which I rarely attended I got a job as the night manager at Haagen Dazs in the Biltmore This has forever ruined my experience with the majority of ice cream joints On Christmas eve I had a hankering for some ice cream a hankering really Tony what are you 75 anyways my Dad happened to have a Groupon for Sweet Republic so we checked it out Being the glutton I am I ordered the flagship Sundae With three scoops multiple toppings whip cream etc etc The ingredients are all fresh From the homemade ice cream to the freshly whipped cream The caramel I believe is made by a man named Jesus who lives in the middle east some wheres The ice cream is fantastic The owner is knowledgeable and walking the talk as far as local and organic Also the product is able to stand up to my overly critical ice cream palate I am an ice cream freak and this place is FREAKIN GREAT,positive,168,150-200,913,500-1000
If you want to impress someone dont settle for ordinary donuts Instead surprise them with treats from Donut Bar Since its nice to switch things up every now and then they change donut flavors on the regular Its a bit pricey but you pay for the experience and incredible branding,positive,50,25-50,288,<500
Absolutely love this place We come here every chance we get and they never disappoint Today is their 2nd anniversary and they have face painting for the children raffles and donut eating contest Theyre also giving a free birthday cake donut to everyone The staff is always very friendly and theyre French toast donut is very yummy,positive,57,50-75,338,<500
The hours posted and on the phone message were incorrect Drove over actually went out of my way and they were closed,negative,22,<50,120,<500
The polite helpful and happy staff offered great advice on which were the most popular and their own favorites All the ingredients are organic The store was not busy So for that I gave them 2 stars My wife had the salted butter Carmel swirl which had little to no flavor and no Carmel or Carmel taste I had the chocolate walnut oatmeal which I could taste but the ice cream itself had very little flavor However I did get to pay over 8 for two of the tiniest round ball scoops of ice cream So I gave two stars for a great staff and zero stars for ice cream that had less flavor than the cheapest ice cream I ever had,negative,122,100-150,627,500-1000
Yummy favorite macarons Giant and yummy just like in Napa All are good but pistachio still remains my favorite,positive,19,<50,117,<500
We came here looking to try wonderful desserts We ordered 3 different desserts and got our food in a box Then we looked into our box and one order was wrong so we went back and ask for an exchange for the correct one We got back attitude with NO sorry got a response we just sold the last one Then I told her to refund our money she was not happy She told us to just wait went on to serve other customers and it took awhile to get our refund She was rude obnoxious and need to go back for more training in good customer service No apology for getting it wrong at all and no apology for making us wait awhile to get our refund,negative,128,100-150,641,500-1000
We have gotten donuts there a few times and its sooooooo good I wish their hours were better but man is it good when I can get it The donuts always have a good taste well made and worth every penny you spend on them My mother was the one that told me about them and while I wasnt too sure about it at first my doubts were proven wrong,positive,70,50-75,345,<500
Im sooo disappointed I brought friends visiting from another country to experience the buttery masterpieces at Bouchon and was bitterly disappointed and embarrassed The chocolate and almond crossiants I normally enjoy were dry and stale They tasted a day old I do not recommend it to anyone and will no longer go back I will be going to Baby Cakes at M Resort when I visit again,negative,67,50-75,385,<500
I was really craving ice cream and visited this place It had really good reviews I ordered the praline which was really really good I also had a scoop of the brownie with caramel which was OK The service was very prompt Also my boyfriend got the brownie sundae and he added cookies and cream ice cream to it He really loved it,positive,63,50-75,333,<500
Great pastries but the service has went downhill We come here every time were in Vegas and the service we received this weekend 3 times mind you it got worse every time we came The last day we were there I called in my order which is required to be prepaid and still waited in line for 20 minutes and were treated like we didnt even exist Very disappointed in the service,negative,72,50-75,380,<500
Everything Ive tried at this Bakery is amazing I only wish they also had some seating area indoors,positive,18,<50,102,<500
I love theicecream here They have an interesting flavor Combinedchocolate pistacio and cherry Do have a combo dissert So u can have a dissert and add a scope of ice cream for additional 2 dollars A little bit pricy I hope they can have wifi I also dont like they using plastc spins and cup foricecream Looks cheap amd mon enviornment friendly Overall great Take a number on the left side of rhe door before u order,positive,77,75-100,430,<500
Love love love supporting black owned businesses which is the primary reason we came here The line moved rather quickly which was a plus and our cereal bowls came out soon after I really did not know what to expect The experience of ordering a cereal bowl was just different I do wish they offered more exotic cereals The seating outside of the cereal bar is few and far betweenjust a little heads up Great concept and very innovative,positive,79,75-100,445,<500
Yummmmmy Tried this place for the first time and I will definitely be coming back for more Tried a chocolate shake chocolate chip and banana flavor scoops New favorite,positive,29,25-50,173,<500
We sought this place out to try the donuts but they were completely sold out of all donuts on a Saturday morning Poor management and planning in my opinion Dont waste your time walking through a somewhat sketchy area to only be disappointed,negative,43,25-50,244,<500
I am a huge fan of cheesecake so dont take this lightlythis is easily one of the best pieces of cheesecake Ive ever had Would recommend 1010 Friendly staff too,positive,30,25-50,170,<500
Very disappointing We purchased a cannoli caramel cupcake and cheesecake with chocolate mouse and and a chocolate covered strawberry on top Cannoli was very good and tasted like a cannoli should The caramel cupcake was so dense dry and completely flavorless The icing was hard and crushed the cake when we tried to cut into it with a fork I love cupcakes and enjoy more light and fluffy icing with a moist cake The cheesecake bottom was good A rich cream taste and very smooth the chocolate mouse was light and airy and had a good taste but something about the taste of the chocolate on the strawberries gave it a foul taste like spoiled milk We threw it and the cupcake away So basically we enjoyed a 2000 cannoli Id save my money and go elsewhere,negative,137,100-150,765,500-1000
Terrible customer service Overpriced mediocre food at best Stopped by about 10AM on a Sat for a snack and some juice There were 6 people working behind the counter and every one of them was dismissive and unfriendly They all seemed as if they hated their jobs I get that customer service can be a frustrating job especially in food but I expect to be treated with kindness and respect After I ordered and paid they forgot my food I had to ask for it about 10 mins later The bottled orange juice was good The toasted turkey and cheese baguette was not Dry Cold Tough Disappointing Maybe their coffee and espresso drinks are better but Ill never stop by there again to find out,negative,125,100-150,699,500-1000
Beautiful space serving delicious frozen goodness You want to have a elegant slumber party here Ice cream can be tricky for medigestively if you know what I meannot Michells I popped in this past Friday and tried the toasted pistachio and vegan sea salt caramelso delish The vegan flavor finishes off slightly coconuttyI loved it and am so shocked at how similiar in texture taste and flavor it is to REAL ice cream I am a vegan believerwell at least here anyway,positive,82,75-100,486,<500
Review is for taste of bakery items only We are fans of the show so me and kids had to roll in and see the Cake Boss bakery They didnt have any fabulous cakes displayed which was a disappointment It was a Sunday in late July so no line to complain about The quality of pastries wasnt all that I actually let the kids have the cookies and we opted for Bouchon bakery instead We tried the eclair stuffed croissant Canolis and cookies If I had to wait in a line for mediocre pastures I wouldve been pissed,negative,98,75-100,516,500-1000
I wish the ice cream choices were less watery I was so confused cause this place had five stars on Yelp,negative,21,<50,105,<500
so I decided to give this place a try for their macarons and OMG Im so disappointed I dont understand how this place got good reviews for their macarons It basically just crumbled and fell apart in the box that they gave me and where is the filling Definitely worth the price that I paid for ,negative,57,50-75,300,<500
Tried one of the large raspberry macarons It was subpar It was crunchy and just didnt wow me I had high hopes ,negative,23,<50,117,<500
Just ordered cafe caramel creme at 1230 82 So disappointing Doesnt taste anything like what I usually order I even asked if the coffee had caramel I think there is too much turnover here No consistency in the way they make their coffee anymore I have had some great coffee here and I never have to add a thing 7th Street coffee is my new go to place for consistently good coffee,negative,72,50-75,390,<500
Went there today for the first time and as we were waiting in line we saw one of the workers named shanel eating with gloves on Then she started to scratch her face her arms and her back and never bothered to change her gloves Then she started to prep some of the pastries I ended up buying a cannoli which was really good but that one employee was just very disgusting And I have this place 1 star because of her,negative,82,75-100,422,<500
Awesome Staff is very accommodating A wide variety of specialty donuts will have your mouth watering The coffee is great try the Portland blend The kids get balloons and a cool childs donut Gotta end this review Im heading to Donut Bar now,positive,43,25-50,249,<500
Cool vibe but the food isnt worth the hype At all,negative,11,<50,52,<500
Very racist if your black do not go here  My number was called and I was skipped numerous time they had genuine courtesy for the Caucasian people but when I was skipped I was told to take another number I tried to explain the guy cut me off in mid conversation and called the next number,negative,57,50-75,290,<500
Disappointing to say the least For a place that closes at 10pm they were out and had empty shelves and it was only 630pm And when I asked one of the girls if they were baking anymore pastries she said no because they didnt think they would be as busy as they were and that they only baked a certain amount for the day I realize they have been open for just a few days but they have quite a ways to go before they meet the standards set by their California bakeries Didnt matter what time of day I went into one of the California locations they had fresh just out of the oven pastries and they had at least 2workers walking the floor and communicating with the bakers what was needed on the floor Not only that they greeted you as soon as you walked inthe staff at this location looked beat down and exhausted and I had the girl tell me she hates they have to pack the pastries at the register I was thinking I wouldnt know since you have nothing to offer The location is roomy but they have wasted space that could have occupied more pastries Then again no reason since the shelves are empty To top it off they had one cashier and a long line Yet they had at least 4people standing behind her huddled and talking about who knows what and since the girl confirmed they werent baking anything why was no one else helping with the long line Again they are new but take a page from your California locations and take the initiative to keep the ovens baking so you can meet the demand for your product There is no reason for you to be open till 10pm yet have empty shelves 4hours prior to close Why bother staying open And my drive down there is a ways away and was a waste of time The hype behind this place is not living up to the expectation See Jeremys review below and that is what the shelves looked like last night Seems to be a trend,negative,357,300- 500,1875,1500-2000
Did you know they served Korean corn dogs Because I did not This is not a corn dog review but its worth mentioning because they are trendy and to my knowledge Masons is the only one doing them in Cleveland thus far This is a review of the ice cream Do you want interesting flavors If so this is your place To be honest Im not sure how often they change the flavors but theyre always innovative Ive had the black sesame but this time I got a small two scoop  malted chocolate and tahitiansomething Yes I know these dont go together were not here to judge my pairing choices The chocolate was malted and the tahitian flavor tasted like fruit punch the person ringing me out wa definitely right when describing the flavor The ice cream was great and its getting g hot why arent you there every week,positive,151,150-200,828,500-1000
Visiting Vegas and wanted to try some French pastry Found this on Yelp Im less than impressed I ordered an epi bread mini baguette 6 macaroons in 6 flavors and a TKO cookie The Epi bread was hard as a rock I threw it away after 1 bite Plus fresh bread tastes best hot not room temp Next I tried the TKO Supposedly white ganache inside a chocolate cookie crust I love ganache so I couldnt wait to try it Meh It tasted like an oreo but 10 times more expensive At least I ate that Then I had 2 macaroons Very gelatinous in texture Not like a typical macaroon which I knew from looking at it but just not very good at all Ill give them to my friend so at least they wont go to waste but Im not eating anymore Not worth it at all,negative,148,100-150,752,500-1000
You either love the cupcakes at Sprinkles or absolutely hate them thats how Sprinkles has divided the folks that I know Anyway Im in the Love It camp so when I found this large bright store in The LINQ shopping plaza when staying next door at the Flamingoes I literally stopped by every day This is part icecream shop and part cupcake shop rolled into one It seems here the icecreams are more popular than the cupcakes as I always found a long line for the icecream section but none for the cupcake section If you only want cupcakes there is a small door on the far left that you can use to get to the smaller line for only cupcakes For the uninitiated there are different cupcake flavors available on different days so if you are looking for a specific flavor it would make sense to check that out online before you visit On the other hand I dont mind trying different flavors so the rotation does not bother me much Most of their cupcakes are 375 which is a bit high yet not in the gourmet 7 range Ive also tried a couple of their icecream flavors 375 a scoop but feel that the one you should surely try is CapnCrunch which is available year round This is basically caramelized Capn Crunch cereal sprinkled into Capn Crunch flavored icecream that is unique to Sprinkles They also have cookies 3 each sundaes icecream sandwiches and shakes For the best of both worlds try the Sprinkles shake 850 which is 2 scoops of icecream blended with one cupcake that is again unique to Sprinkles Enjoy your icecreams and cupcakes I certainly did,positive,282,250-300,1592,1500-2000
Jack Frost is the mother of all donut shops in the known universe These incredible round concoctions of tasty ecstatic delight are what gastronomical dreams are made of They harken back to a time when ingredients and food were pure and fresh and not laden with harmful chemicals additives preservatives high fructose corn syrup and GMOs Hell even the donut HOLE tastes great Prediabetics and fitness freaks need not apply,positive,70,50-75,434,<500
Kind of an obscure location its hiding under the escalator My friends and I had to go and ask three workers to tell us where it was After being mislead a few times and wandering around aimlessly on the casino floor we finally found it I guess it didnt help that I was smashed from my Fat Tuesdays drink but thats another story The traditional croissant met all my expectations for everything I love about these buttery little bastards flaky crust on the outside soft and airy on the inside Well done One bite of my friends strawberry croissant and I was hooked Incredibly moist sweet without feeling like youll develop a cavity I also had a taste of the chocolate macaron which was very rich and decadent It felt so sinful Soso with the smore cheesecake The textures were off in my opinion The chocolate was chunky and hard wouldve been much better smooth like the cream filling The marshmallow was difficult to eat And the butter in the graham cracker crust overpowered the other flavors The next day I returned and got some bread that resembled foccacia It was so soft like a pillow The only awkward thing that happened was that I forgot my green tea at the barista counter Realizing this 10 minutes later I returned and it was still there I wanted to make sure that it was mine so I asked the workers They just gave me blank stares,positive,245,200-250,1377,1000-1500
Heard this place made the best ice cream I have to disagree Baskin Robbins flavors are better No place to sit and eat there are only 3 benches Its not a parlor where you can sit and enjoy a sundae if you so choose to get one With all the hype expected to have homemade sauces and whipped cream NOT Brought my relatives from out of state they were very disappointed Do not recommend and will not go back,negative,79,75-100,416,<500
Great desserts not too heavy on so can taste more flavors l Good place for a quick snack or a variety of baked items,positive,24,<50,118,<500

My daughter is a professional baker and she wanted to taste their famous cannoli She brought enough for everyone to sample I was thinking how wonderful it would be to have a cannolo made by an old school Jersey bakery I mean their bakery on tv seems to have all the classics That nostalgia appeals to me Buddy seems like a nice guy How could this possibly be a fail Let me tell you dont believe all the stuff you see on tv It isnt true It all goes back to being a kid and your parents tell you the exact same thing That was the flashback I had when I tasted the cannolo The horror The disbelief It was all lies Lies I tell you These cannolis were not made by an old school baker It was made by someone who doesnt care They dont care that you are a fan of the show cannoli or anything else I would bet that the shells are shipped to their storefront and the filling comes in a bag premade Cannoli filled by someone who probably doesnt even like cannoli Because if they did like cannoli they wouldnt put that nasty gritty artificial non dairy weird textured filling into that premade greasy shell and pass it off as authentic cannoli Tears are streaming down my face as I write this Such disappointment I will never watch that show again,negative,237,200-250,1280,1000-1500
Long lines Not sure what the buzz about this place was Tried it Not my thing My wife liked what she had But she also didnt think it was worth the time or money Perhaps it was the night we were there,negative,42,25-50,206,<500
The cake was excellent moist and rich The line was long but moved very quickly Well worth the wait,positive,19,<50,103,<500
Not worth the wait Was pretty disappointed to have stood in line for 1 cannoli and 1 lobster tail only to have spent 10 on notthatgreattasting treats Not sure if it was just my pallet but the lobster tail was very bland The cannoli was over creamed Probably enjoyed the first bite of each and was immediately sick of it afterwards If youve never had anything from this bakery definitely try it They have a great way of branding the name Not to mention Buddys restaurant is directly across the hall Might try that place sometime Other than that I would take a hard pass on this bakery next time,negative,110,100-150,612,500-1000
I have to admit I was a little hesitant going to the donut bar After all imho it had a large shoes to fill because of the prior tenant O Face Donuts Sure O face is now gone and one should not compare a defunct business to the next But I cannot help it and I feel if you take the time to read what I mean you may just end up agreeing There is only one single difference between the two shops yet the difference is such a critical element Creative originality The Donut bar attempts to dazzle you with concoctions that are really just kids play The creme brulee is creative in thought yet executed with no afterthought Yea the sugar is cool however only after one bite Attempting to get through the constant crunch soon became annoying I found myself trying to taste the center cream however once the sugar coating finally dissolved and my taste buds came to I found it to be just commercial custard filling Very disappointing The maple O face had was one step ahead of everyone on this When you go to a donut shopno matter what part of the US you go you know what a maple bar taste like It doesnt change and when you have one you have had them all O face however took the time to develop their own maple glaze which complemented the bacon Donut barthe same usual maple The oreo cookie Jeezhow much sugar can you give People this is a regular glazed stuffed with an oreo cookie mmmm Lard O face made donuts that were not only creative but containing other unique flavors Mexican chocolate with horchata cremeyea their own homemade horchatanot a tub filled with flavored gelatin goo Apple fritter Dark Happen to notice this to as the tray containing the fritters all looked the sameover done To their credit the inside was not overdone and actually the best of the group of donuts I had In a nutshell this is no O Face and probably never will be I suppose this means I need to find something more on the level of my expectations Which leads me to a final thought Donuts that cost 24 per should be on the level of artisanal Otherwise what am I paying for that I couldnt already get at Vons,negative,394,300- 500,2146,2000+
Attitude from the top down rude manager rude employees No greeting they stare at you No how can I help you they stare You order they tell you a dollar amount and hand you a receipt Too bad Ghirardelli is a top name a few employees ruin it Addition to my review within a short period this same day I received a message from Ghirardelli Corporate Customer Relations concerning this I am grateful that theyve demonstrated this is not how Ghirardelli wants to be represented and that this is an employee issue and not reflective of their business overall Ghirardelli is still a top notch brand,negative,106,100-150,610,500-1000
This place was AMAZING Had them delivered to our hotel Strawberry pop tart and the original vanilla bean won our vote,positive,21,<50,120,<500
I really really really wanted to like this place I made a special detour to las Vegas just to try the crack pie and ice cream Ill confess my expectations were high after watching the Netflix documentary that featured these treats Sadly it didnt live up to the hype Im not sure what happen but the the prices were high compared to the portion sizes and the deserts were nothing to write home about Wheres the love for quality that I saw in the documentary,negative,85,75-100,464,<500
Line too long  the staff too slow Such a bummer,negative,11,<50,50,<500
So stinking good I was on the search to find some lavender ice cream in Phoenix and I hit the jackpot with this place It took a minute to find but I love everything about the location I had no idea those little cabin shops were there and Im so glad I found them I ordered the honey lavender ice cream in a waffle cone and it was amazing So creamy and not too overpowering Its such a unique flavor I love it I also had a sample of the cookie monster and they werent kidding when they said it would turn your tongue blue watch out The employees are so friendly and let my family try literally every flavor It was such a great experience overall and I cant wait to go back,positive,134,100-150,686,500-1000
High expectations going in disappointed after finishing Flavors were plain forgettable and definitely did not leave me wanting more With a plethora of desert and creamery options in the Scottsdale area look elsewhere for your sweettooth fix,negative,37,25-50,248,<500
I was disappointed in the almond butter croissant it was quite dry and hard but it might of been because I was there right before closing However the macaroons made up for the croissant I liked that it wasnt super cakey yet the filling wasnt too overwhelming,positive,47,25-50,265,<500
There was no one in line before us and took over 10min for cappuccino and wasnt good Had to toss it out,negative,22,<50,106,<500
Cute local spot thats always busy I love the logo and the marketing Staff was friendly but the product was less than impressive I probably wouldnt go back and didnt think it was worth the wait,negative,36,25-50,198,<500
We got the milkshakes at the knights games They were expensive and ended up with soggy cereal at the end The chocolate was better than the strawberry combination but overall we were not a fan You would get milkshake and cereal chunks as you drank it,negative,46,25-50,254,<500
The day prior to visiting Prestis we dined at Mia Bella where the waitress recommended that we try Prestis I have no idea why The service staff were rude and short with us The Stromboli was lukewarm and soggy The wrong soup came and the guy behind the counter was snarky when we asked for a correction The pastries were better,negative,61,50-75,336,<500
i had been to bouchon before and loved it this visitnot so much almond croissant had very little filling and was just soso coffee also hohum,negative,26,25-50,149,<500
As soon as you walk in it feels like youve traveled back in time and ended up in a wealthy persons parlor The cakes have a beautiful display and there are a variety of drinks to choose from The staff are friendly and move carefully behind the counter There is also a parking lot right next door unusual in lawrenceville big plus This would be a great place for an intimate conversation on the sofa or at one of the outdoor garden areas The cake flavors are interesting combinations that arent generally offered at grocery store or barebones bakeries I took away a star because although the cake was yummy it was a bit heavy The cream was airy and subtly sweet and the strawberries were fresh The prices are similar to Cheesecake Factory dessert prices This is a great spot to satisfy your sweet tooth and feel healthy doing it as the desserts are vegan,positive,156,150-200,871,500-1000
I love the flavors that they have and that they constantly change them Its hard to choose a favorite Its such a great place for couples families and friends,positive,29,25-50,163,<500
What a waste of time and money Its an insult to call Fatty Daddys gelato gelato or even ice cream Our server was not kind or helpful in the least bit and seemed to be more interested in the games on his laptop than helping us The inside was grimy We paid 7 each for the cookie bowls and the only edible part was the toasted marshmallow Calling the macaroons a macaroon is an insult once again It should be called a wafer or something equally as gross sounding because it tasted awful Gas station quality ice cream  half a cold flavorless wafer  a toasted marshmallow should not equal 7 We will not be back,negative,117,100-150,624,500-1000
Snooty cool kids place frozen pastries not paying minimum wage Sound like Paris to you,negative,15,<50,91,<500
Fantastic cupcakes Cute little vending machine Location is perfectly centered Grab your in n out and get a cupcakes Reasonably sized for the price,positive,24,<50,151,<500
Ice cream was straight Wasnt the best thing ever Line was long since its new and trendy right now in CLT The waffle cone was mediocre Service was good The staff seemed happy to work there and theres a happy atmosphere at the place since everyone was so excited about the opening,positive,52,50-75,287,<500
Omg this was the worst cupcake Ive ever had it was dry and crumby like powder It must have been DAYS old Shame on Carlos for his lack of attention of this bakery Gordon Ramsey would not have put up with serving crap,negative,43,25-50,222,<500
The BEST ever My family used to get these donuts from original location 50 years ago and they are still great,positive,21,<50,112,<500
Used to be so good but now I feel like every time I go there they have flavors and donuts that appeal more to the eye than what would actually taste good Never really impressed anymore Used to be worth the drive over to the area but honestly with how hard and unappealing theyve been Ill stick to Dunkin,negative,59,50-75,309,<500
Located in the Westside Market One of the cleves most wonderful spotsOhhhhh Yummmmmmm The crepes are divine Delicate dessert crepes buckwheat crepes for the savory entree crepes But is it enough Noooooooope Now comes the Liege Waffle A type of street food waffle dense filling not at all like a belgian waffle This bit of heaven has coarse sugar in the dough that melts into little molten rivers of sweetness in the dough Sweet Baby Jesus Its stuff like this that makes Cleveland winters tolerable Eat waffles They rock,positive,89,75-100,544,500-1000
Very disappointing I went there on 4316 I ordered two cannolis one regular one chocolate a cookie and a vanilla cupcake with chocolate frosting The regular cannoli was pretty good but a little grainy The chocolate one was hard to eat The chocolate was thick and hard but overall it was okay They forgot the cookie The cupcake was disgusting It was dense and not sweet at all It tasted like raw flour My toddler took a bite and spit it out I tried to eat it but had to throw it out,negative,93,75-100,499,<500
Cute little ice cream shop I had a coffee flavored custom sundae and my son had the smores sundae both were amazing Great friendly service too worth the drive from Fountain Hills We will be back,positive,36,25-50,200,<500
WOW it brought me flash backs of my childhood being in a candy store One of the best selections of candy Ive seen at 1600 a pound but they did have a 25 off sale They also have homemade ice cream that looked really good It definitely worth going in and buying different candies you dont see everyday Plus its along the canals with Gondolas going past,positive,67,50-75,361,<500
Overhyped and underwhelming Unlike other yelpers the line wasnt terribly long and moved quickly They had a plethora of options to choose from all of which looked good However the cupcakes themselves were disappointing The cake was relatively dry and lacked flavor At nearly 5 a piece Ive experienced better at most other bakeries selling for the same price This place is busy and popular due to the TV show Otherwise this place would be a bakery to skip over when looking for dessert on the strip,negative,87,75-100,512,500-1000
I have wanted to try this place for a long time and so after dinner at postino I walked across the street for dessert I should have skipped I had butter pecan There were way to may pecans to ice cream ratio or maybe they need chopped up more so its easier to eat Also I walked in there and it smelled like a nasty dirty old dish rag It was so repulsive I nearly walked out and didnt get a thing GROSS,negative,83,75-100,410,<500
Ok on a quick whim for ice cream Sandwiches are super blah and greasy Service sucks the young college girl working the day we went could have cared less and her attitude showed it Nevermind the 4 other guys standing around behind the ice cream counter behind her standing around talkingstaringakward,negative,51,50-75,314,<500
Overpriced pastries and lack of choice I have paid 4 for cappuccino which was exactly 3 sips Double chocolate chip cookie tasted fine but for the price i would bake it myself Do not recommend this place,negative,37,25-50,207,<500
Visited from out of town and a friend recommended this spot We got the Mexican Hot Chocolate Creme BrÃlÃe Homer and Cake Batter doughnuts All were good Creme BrÃlÃe was liiiiittle dry but still delicious Will be back,positive,38,25-50,229,<500
Worth every calorie It was a cold night but we didnt care the ice cream was worth it ,positive,19,<50,89,<500
Every summer brings the heavenly taste of Jarlings to the mortal people of Champiagn I dont know why Im writing review for this tasty treat so late Anyways its better late than never I love their snowstorms and sundaes They taste fresh creamy and yum Yes there are long queues at the counter but I believe Im burning few calories while waiting in the queue which justifies me binging on snowstorm or sundae What can I say Im optimistic Soyesterday after running for 3 miles my body was in serious need of glucose so I HAD TO go to Jarlings or I would have fainted  I ordered a fruit cup snow storm because fruits are healthy It had strawberries and banana couldnt taste any other fruit By the time I took picture it had melted But still tasted gooooood Gonna try as many flavors as I can till summer lasts,positive,151,150-200,841,500-1000
Love their pastries and cakes  delicious So I was eager to order three cakes for an upcoming major milestone birthday party A very friendly employee helped me place my order and I was looking forward to my guests enjoying incredible desserts Unfortunately the party was cancelled with two days notice I immediately called Villanis and was told by employee  whose name I jotted down  that the cancellation was no problem The cakes werent baked and they hadnt run my credit card Great Now I could focus on making other cancellation calls Then I received a call from Villanis They werent going to honor that cancellation after all So confusing One employee tells me the cancellation is no problem the next one tells me I cant cancel Okay fine whatever Cake is the least of my problems  Ill just give the cakes away So the next afternoon I pick up the three cakes Two of them are in boxes that dont close the top is open because the cakes are too tall for the boxes Im not thrilled about driving around town to deliver cakes in open boxes Ive never gotten a bakery cake in a box that wont close  this is nuts Only after I question their practice of putting cakes in toosmall boxes do I learn that they actually have bigger boxes So I asked for the bigger boxes  wondering why they just didnt give me properly sized boxes in the first place So theres my story They sure know how to bake but the customer service side of things is very confusing,negative,270,250-300,1489,1000-1500
U gotta be kidding right we have 20 people on line n only one cashier where is the manager Cmonnnnnn today may 27 at 715pm ,negative,26,25-50,125,<500
Ive met my matcha This place is amazing Lots of selections from lattes teas espresso based drinks and even soft serve Its a little on the pricy side 67 per drink but definitely worth it in my opinion,positive,38,25-50,213,<500
A little annoyed that I drove 30mins to try this place out and all they had was 5 flavors to choose from For the people that have to make a drive maybe you should call ahead and see if theyre serving more than 5 flavors or have waffles in stock It was a waste of my time,negative,57,50-75,278,<500
They never disappoint Donuts are delicious and service is literally unmatched  I always get the grilled cheese and add extra like 4 extra of the Spicy mayo ,positive,29,25-50,164,<500
No military discount here Minimal seating at this ice cream store 2 stars because the employees were unfriendly,negative,18,<50,115,<500
I went for the salted caramel brownie It was very good The brownie was soft and creamy with a thick layer of salted caramel Melted in my mouth I also tried an apricot pastry There wasnt much apricot in it though it was flakey A cute place with tables inside and out,positive,52,50-75,273,<500
The shop was beautiful and clean with a very colorful display of many different varieties of goodies My only qualm was the fact that we had to wait 45 minutes just to get in and order But the strawberry shortcake chocolate chip cookies and cannolis were amazing,positive,47,25-50,268,<500
Donuts were great I suggest the French Toast Donut Honestly its the best of both worlds Wont find anything else like it definitely a must have if youre near Fremont Street,positive,31,25-50,182,<500
I get my nails done in the same complex LOVE them I used to work across the street Today I decided to have my nails done The etching on the window says  coffee and tea I order a cookie and a tea The girl behind the counter is super flustered and stares at me we dont serve tea here why the heck do you have someone etch tea on your front window when you dont sell it Super lame,negative,80,75-100,396,<500
Jarlings hits the spot when it comes to frozen treats in the CU area They dont have a large selection of flavors but the flavors they do offer have always been great They have a few staples like vanilla chocolate etc but Id recommend trying the weeks special Their snowstorms dqs blizzards are great too Some negative things though There is a 10 minimum for credit cards there is no minimum for debit cards but be prepared to show a government issued id Their custards can be on the sweet side and there is some artificial flavoring in the fruitier flavors,positive,101,100-150,577,500-1000
I cant believe how long it took for me to finally come upon this gem in Little Italy I came here for lunch the other day and I ordered the sausage and spinach stromboli with a side of marinara sauce This was so delicious and so incredibly CHEAP I also tried a bite of my friends gnocchi which was also bombdiggity I definitely recommend trying their hot foods which are located to the right side of the registers Theyre affordable and yummy in the tummy You also should try their apricot linzers and mini chocolate macaroonstheyre to die for Two thumbs up for Prestis,positive,104,100-150,585,500-1000
Whenever I am in the area of Little Italy I always have to stop in at Prestis My family and I love all the desserts they have to offer and the gelato there is authentic and rich just like it is offered in Italy The staff really knows what they are doing and are helpful to the people who come in and out of the store,positive,66,50-75,321,<500
My wife and I went to Postinos and were given a flyer promoting this place A few days later we were going to go out for gelato when we decided to try something different instead and drove over to Churn The parking situation was a hot mess with valet or parking down a residential street being the only two options I am sure the neighbors are not impressed with the ramshackle of cars cruising up and down their street looking for a parking space We were one of many looking for a spot My wife convinced me this was worth the effort so I continued to look for parking After a few tries we parked down the street and made our way inside The place is tiny with an old style ice cream shop look but no feel The place is kinda sterile but from the reviews others find it charmimg Not sure why the place is landlord white with glass candy jars filled with candy Someone compared it to Farrells but I would have to completely disagree This place lacks the utter feeling of immersion of someplace grand different exciting that I remember when I walked into a Farrells This was more like blank ice cream shop with candy jars on display Also if you get cold easily then bring a sweater my wife was chilled after waiting in line for 15 minutes to get served The service was friendly my wife ordered chocolate with salted caramel topping The salted caramel topping was waaaay to salty for my taste It tasted like caramel for a second then you were hit with nothing but pure salt taste  like licking a slab of salt  literally This ruined both the chocolate and the caramel Her scoop was just plain awful and had that been the extent of our experience I would have given the place 1 star Seriously it was that bad I ordered the Vietnamese coffee and Madagascar vanilla 2 scoop in a cup with no toppings They were both good although nothing special The two stars is based purely on the two scoops I ordered Also I did have a bit of the ice crystal problem in my two scoops I am not a big fan of ice crystals in my ice cream It reminds me of the old box of 100 bargain ice cream one forgot was in the freezer but eaten anyway to cure that sweet tooth six months later I will also say my wifes one scoop was as big a serving as my two scoops I was not a happy camper Overall Churn is ok nothing lessnothing more My wifes ice cream was a disaster of flavors Mine was small and good but nothing out of the ordinary 2 solid stars See the potential 1 star review above In all fairness my wife would have given this place 3 solid stars based on my two scoops,negative,492,300- 500,2593,2000+
Ill begin by saying I love Amelies Its a treat when I get to go but Sunday night at around 230 am was different My husband and I ordered 5 different pastries for us and our children and 2 sandwiches We waited a while for our sandwhichesno big deal Then we see a man take our sandwiches to the wrong person and get upset I tried to tell him they were ours but he brushed passed me ignoring me It was obvious he was upset He threw our food down behind the counter and started angrily throwing them into to go boxes I had a side salad and he slammed it around until half the salad fell out of the bowl Another lady had to remake the salad My husband yelled at him to stop being so rough with our food but he ignored my husband He tried to give our food away again to the same guy but then calmed down enough to hear it was ours He was like Im sorry man I was so disappointed in the entire experience I also drive for Uber and recommend Amelies to numerous out of town guests I probably wont anymore if they risk being treated that way No matter how successful a business is they should always treat their customers with more respect,negative,223,200-250,1160,1000-1500
A south side summer staple Say that 4 times as fast One can expect to find a family atmosphere here and who doesnt like soft serve,positive,26,25-50,134,<500
I love sprinkles I am from Los Angeles and have frequented the Beverly Hills location for 7 years in addition to the Irvine location Never have I experienced such lackluster service as I did at the Vegas location today There seemed to be no system of operation For example both my friend and I ordered mini sundaes the ice cream side of the store both with red velvet cupcakes however the associate made several visits back and fourth to a mysterious back room to bring out two of the same cupcake at different times Another associates hair was falling into the ice cream freezer and overall sanitation did not appear to be considered Furthermore there was limited space for the line of customers Just disappointed,negative,125,100-150,729,500-1000
I was definitely expecting more from this place based off of the photos The reviews were accurate everything was subpar at best Which is unfortunate I tried the Red Velvet Milkshake BDay Cake slice BDay Cake Truffles and Milk Pie The only thing that was above average was the Milk Pie The Cake slice was hard and not moist at all and everything else was justregular I definitely will not be visiting this place again,negative,75,50-75,433,<500
I ordered a drink wait 30min they told me runs out They could told me at the first then I dont have to spend my time wait and wait They told me if I want another drink I need to do refund and purchase again how long do I need to wait for a drink maybe like a hour I serious dont have that much time to wait for just a couple coffee I think this is not professional at all they took too long to make drink need to improve that,negative,92,75-100,433,<500
The irony I used to live in San Francisco and not even once have I gone to Ghirardelli Square I was walking around the Strip and stumbled upon Ghirardelli and just so happen to craving for something sweet The sundae did not disappoint and its enough to share with literally 4 other people It really hits the spot Im just drooling thinking about it now Be prepared it is pricy but worth every penny Vegas is for indulging afterall right,positive,80,75-100,454,<500
If you havent been to sprinkles you gotta try it Its a little pricey but well worth it,positive,18,<50,92,<500
Donut upgrade Using better ingredients appears to work The donuts here are generally well above average The apple fritter was the most familiar tasting item but it was still as good as the best I have had I would stay away from the grilled cheese unless you know youll like it It was a bit much for me though the sauce that comes with it is delicious and well matched I am thankful this place is an eight hour drive from home since otherwise I might be eating these donuts often enough to get a physique to match one of them,positive,101,100-150,536,500-1000
I was at Mitchells ice cream on West 25th when I saw too young teenagers or that taking 6 ice cream cones outside sitting them on the table photographing them and then right in front of a homeless man how asked about them through all six in the garbage without even tasted one of them they were also employees of Mitchells ice cream,negative,63,50-75,334,<500
Love this place I always get the Halo Halo The owners are very sweet  always greets us when we visit Definitely recommend,positive,23,<50,126,<500
I was surprised and disappointed with the taste of cupcakes I am sure we can find much more better taste bakery in this town and other states I cant find any special their taste and decorations Of course better than the one we buy from supermarket but Just little better Smells good around the bakery also I dont smell artificial smell But the frosting taste artificial ingredients but of course little better than the one we buy from the super market Is it just the power of the Media I hope the original bakery is much better taste If not that is not fair,negative,104,100-150,570,500-1000
Must hit place in Charlotte and doesnt hurt that its located by all things cool in Noda Open 24 hours theres never an offtime although there are many ON times with a line reaching into separate rooms Youll know youre in the right spot right away with all the creative artwork and antique pieces Ive heard it feels just like France although I will verify AFTER my future visit The restaurant is made up of 3 rooms with an eclectic array of chairs and tables Free wifi and water too and youll find outlets along the walls for the necessary charge NOTE I discovered the back room gets the best reception during my visit Youll walk in and immediately be greeted by a glass counter filled with goodies pastries and sweet treats But thats not all that Amelie offers Theyve got a breakfast and lunch menu filled with sandwiches quiche and coffeeteas I recommend the turkey and brie sandwich its served on a baguette with a seedy raspberry jam Ive tried an assortment of treats and much say I need to keep trying The Napoleon was too messy and tricky to eat you really need to let it heat up but it falls apart really easily I also tried a fruit maybe orange and tarragon macaron recently that was just ok on flavor although great texture The downside is that Amelies is pretty pricy when it comes to their bakery so you cant go too crazy without the bill going crazy Ill keep returning until I find the perfect combination you really cant get over the atmosphere,positive,267,250-300,1507,1500-2000
As good as it gets The ice cream is great My favorite was the sundae with salty caramel They offer exotic flavors as well as traditional ones,positive,27,25-50,145,<500
Dont understand the hype The crack pie wasnt that addicted too sweet for my taste bud Corn flake ice cream was okay one cookie for 450 oh cmon,negative,28,25-50,152,<500
Everything French and what you would expect from a French restaurant in France Everything inside was very beautiful and quant The deserts are to die for Very decedent and scrumptious Prices range based on the food you get but its similar in price to Star B However the atmosphere is completely different and you need to experience it for yourself Its on our list of places we take our friends and family to experience when they come to visit us in SC They have multiple locations all are respectable establishments,positive,90,75-100,524,500-1000
Let me say I usually love this place My negative review is that Ive driven to their location and ordered through app and my favorite item is on the website and online order form and its not something they claim to carry except seasonally If you dont want to carry Pineapple Express year round please remove it from your Chandler location menu,negative,62,50-75,350,<500
Not worth the hype We waited in line for a solid 25 minutes just to be presented with a surprisingly nondiverse menu The shake was pretty much one underwhelming flavor of ice cream that made me feel worse about myself for mindlessly consuming it and overpaying The packaged cookies are actually really good but not worth the wait for the price of everything else,negative,64,50-75,368,<500
As many people have reported Dry basic tasting cupcakes I am a huge fan of Cake Boss so this was a bit distressing after having waited in a line for so long to get it The staff is not the best First me and my fiance were treated rudely by the lady working the line she clearly was more concerned about getting off work than being helpful and doing her job Then when ordering Ive never had a cannoli I asked if the connoli had chocolate because my fiance is allergic and he said no We were nearly about to chow down when the worker advised us that there was chocolate Long story short I will stick with the bakeries out in my city I do have to say some of the cookies were nice but then again how do you mess up a cookie,negative,145,100-150,733,500-1000
Best ice cream in the city for sure hands down aint no doubt about it Due to Cleveland weather being bipolar Mitchells ice cream is good during the middle of a winter storm and the hottest summer day No matter the time of year once you have this ice cream youll always be craving it Multiple creative flavors to choose from always make going feel like your first time Okay Im done ranting about ice cream heaven and I mean Mitchells This ice cream and its facility are just simply superb,positive,91,75-100,505,500-1000
These cupcakes were so pretty looking bit very dry as Hell The icing was Awesome Too Bad Cupcake Boss but your Cupcakes Sucks,negative,23,<50,129,<500
I should have known not to get bubble tea at a coffee shop The taro milk tea didnt have any flavor and the boba was hard Do not recommend going here for boba,negative,33,25-50,161,<500
Had high hopes for this new ice cream shop Have visited twice now The menu is fun the coffee is tasty the pricing is comparable  Its the customer service thats completely lacking On both opening day Saturday 814 and several days later there was no air of excitement attentiveness or enthusiasm You feel like youre ordering from the most dour exhausted and disinterested people To be a success going there should be a fun experience The appearance of the place looks fun and its ice cream and coffee for goodness sake Well likely give it one more try and sample the ice cream but frankly if its the same Id drive farther for a more enjoyable time,negative,118,100-150,677,500-1000
Youve got to get here early otherwise they sell out and thats all she wrote OK so are they as they boast the best donuts in the world No but they are very good So if you find yourself downtown early in the morning get in line before hey run out Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin Out Loud,positive,63,50-75,307,<500
Always a gem of a place The ambiance alone will make anyone giddy Its such a fun place with the most unbelievable flavors My favorite thing about this location in downtown Cle is the fact you can overlook the ice cream being made when you head upstairs The location has art all over and is so clean and inviting My favorite flavors are the bing cherry the banana cream pie and when Im feeling a little healthy the vegan caramel pecan Love love love Mitchells and its seriously always such a treat,positive,92,75-100,509,500-1000
The hipster in me would like to inform you that this place isnt what it used to be but the realist is still super happy to have a unique 24 hour bakery hangout in Charlotte Yes the pastries are a little less artisanal now but give them credit for the ability to scale up and produce a crap ton of desserts and food at all hours Its still legions better than alot of commercial baked goods There is plenty to choose from even at 1 am prices are reasonable and the atmosphere is great For best quality I would stick with the originals including the salted caramel brownie napoleon and mini gateaus I wasnt too impressed with the macarons or smore pastry the espresso was very decent but too sour for my taste,positive,133,100-150,721,500-1000
Best Ice cream Ever We made a day out of it and took the light rail here Loved the trio with three different flavors I absolutely loved the ooey gooey butter cake,positive,32,25-50,168,<500
So far this is the only place to rival my favorite Ice cream shop Ive ever been to I will definitely be keeping this on my radar when I make it back to the Cleveland area The salted caramel ice cream is pretty much perfection,positive,45,25-50,229,<500
Place seems pretty popular you cannot taste test the ice cream so you dont know what your getting in to For 2 single cups of ice cream was 13 so pretty expensive Also not the cleanest place Worker never washed her hands or wore gloves and was touching everyones ice cream,negative,51,50-75,278,<500
Im not going to say it was bad but dont see whats the big hype I drove 45 miles to try it I had the Belg choc As mention it was not bad just taste like regular ice cream to me Ill give it another shot but for now not jumping on the band wagon,negative,55,50-75,252,<500
Huge fan of this new place Its hard to get me out of bed early on a Saturday but the treats were worth it and well be back I cant express in words how fantastic the oatmeal cream pies are crunchy but chewy and just wonderful Everything else we tried was awesome too smores brownie Oreo cake jar Oreo truffle cookie but those were my favorite Also got a very solid latte here with homemade caramel Highly recommend,positive,78,75-100,431,<500
DO NOT BUY THE APPLE FRITTERS Im so disappointed that it was DRY AFreminds me of a loaf of day old bread but it looks decent until you bite it if I had to describe it in one word it would be REFUND,negative,43,25-50,204,<500
THE CANOLI cream tastes like eating white flour  Not worth the hype the red velvet cup cake is meh  Sorry Carlos,negative,23,<50,120,<500
Staff were very rude and made us feel very unwelcome but the drinks were good and the area is very cool,negative,21,<50,105,<500
A solid spot in Lawrenceville Went here because two of my friends had their wedding cake from here it was great The space itself is cool they have an eclectic style of decor inside They have a nice variety of offerings some a little strange but overall I think most people could find something here They also have some great beverage options coffee espresso etc I had the blueberry rose cake with vanilla buttercream Their icing is fantastic but the cake was a little dry for my liking Prices are a little steep Would definitely try this place again,positive,99,75-100,569,500-1000
The ice cream flight is where its at A fun way to try many flavors at once The price isnt bad either The only reason I didnt give it that last star is because I wish they had a better seating situation outside  more seating and more covershade from the sun,positive,52,50-75,265,<500
Super disappointed in this bakery Was here last night waiting in a 30 minute line with 2 kids only to be told when ordering that there were no more cannolis left Okay so it was 630 pm I get it Youre only well known for these things but whatever I asked the cashier after buying some cookies since we were waiting so long when he recommends coming back for them and he said8 am is the best time when we open So here we are at 8 am only to be told that today they are only serving it in evening Three things 1 let people know when they are waiting in line when something is out 2 train your staff on being accurate and truthful on your bakery and when things are available 3 really No cannolis in your bakery but available online Ill pass,negative,146,100-150,764,500-1000
We heard a lot of positive things about Bouchon Bakery so we decided to trek to the Venetian where Bouchon Bakery is located Venetian and Palazzo is a one huge maze so my most useful tip would be that the bakery is located right next to the Grand Lux Cafe We arrived and was gravely disappointed because the storefront resembled a kiosk not unlike how a Starbucks is nestled at the local Target We didnt know what to expect but we were def bummed out They dont really have a dining area reserved exclusively for the bakery We had to find a spot at the food court 30 yards away We ordered latte and chocolate croissants The coffee was no different from sambalatte but the croissants were not nearly as good It was flaky and kinda dry We prefer doughy and soft,negative,142,100-150,772,500-1000
Tried this place awhile ago not too long after it opened I didnt have any ice cream but did try some of their cookies and crack pie I dont get it Their baked goods are gross Lol I really dont get it But I suppose everyone who thinks their sandy textured weird tasting stuff is tasty just have unique taste buds Different strokes,negative,63,50-75,342,<500
Apparently this is Tom Hanks favorite place how do I know that I dont know someone told me he visits the area and its been declared so Anywhos I had never had a custard cup before who knew in the college town of Champaign hid a custard cup place that would be as addictive as nicotine I went 2 out of the 3 days I was in town visiting Coffee Oreo Snowstorm on the first visit and Strawberry Shortcake Snowstorm the second trip both costing a reasonable 375 Needless to say I polished off both cups of custard each time Supposedly 90 fat free but I dont believe something that good could ever be fat free The menu is huge and every combination flavor imaginable is up there it kinda looks like a McDs Flurry but NO IT DOES NOT TASTE LIKE ONE It gets really packed on the weekends I kinda want one right now it gives me something to look forward to when I visit,positive,167,150-200,887,500-1000
I was so excited for Milk Bars arrival And I was So disappointed I got 3 cookies a shake and a soft serve ice cream Everything was OK but for 26 I expected to be blown away and I wasnt There are off Strip places for way less money turning out a much better product I wished that this location was more bakery and less walk up counter I think when you SEE items in a bakery case Its part of the experience Everything here is already packaged to go or with the frozen treats you dont see them until you get them Also there is no seating anywhere The Birthday Cake shake was tasty but fairly small for 10 The soft serve cup is one size but they do fill it up I got the cereal milk flavor with the cornflake topping It definitely tasted like it was supposed to which I enjoyed bit the ice cream had a weird texture that was offputtinglike the cream was curdled or something I threw it away about halfway through Cookies was an OK size and a chewy texture but 3 for 8 Completely overpriced I can cross this place off my bucket list but I wont likely be back,negative,208,200-250,1100,1000-1500
This place is just nasty The employees here can be so rude They use disgusting ingredients on top of it too like high fructose corn syrup ish I ordered a sandwich and it was put in wrong It took me almost a half hour to get it sorted out only to be met by a sarcastic cashier tell me we are REALLY busy when he was the one who screwed my order up in the first place They took my sandwich back in the kitchen put an egg on it and brought it back to me I had ordered a bacon egg cheese croissant and was given a BLT they put an egg on the BLT lettuce and all and slopped it back in a to go bag No thanks Will NEVER eat here again My first experience here was ordering a birthday cake that literally had two inches of butter cream in between two tiny slivers of cakes Literally everyone at the party threw it out I emailed to complain and wasnt even offered a refund Thought Id given them another shot nope Still nasty,negative,186,150-200,941,500-1000
The butter pecan and salted caramel topping is incredible Gotta check this place out when in town,positive,17,<50,99,<500
Tried 4 different cookies Too sweet not fresh not delicious Lots of ingredients that seem to be there for spectacle rather than effect Very disappointing I really wish I hadnt spent the money and I dont often say that Frankly I think the celebrity chefbaker with their name on this place should be a bit embarrassed to serve these I assume the profits outweigh the shame The counter person was very nice,negative,72,50-75,417,<500
Poor customer service and the ice cream was salty Not sure if it was a bad batch The young lady that fixed my order was very condensing when I asked for a water that I orderes When I discovered the ice cream was off I just throw it in the trash and didnt take it back I gave them one star because my husband liked the cookies he ordered,negative,69,50-75,346,<500
The line outside is an indicator of the splendidness that awaits you on the inside Everything you and your grandmama can think of is a flavor here From Brambleberry to Texas Sheet Cake to Cold Brew Coffee Jenis has you covered Whats better you can get half scoops to try multiple flavors if youre like me and want ONE OF EACH Someday someday Today I tried the Blueberry Lavender so so good the Biscuits and Peach Jam so so so so good and the Goat Cheese and Cherry mmm drool so so so good Ill definitely be back Jenis is the best ice cream in town,positive,106,100-150,583,500-1000
Bouchon has my favorite Macarons ever Ive had Macarons from Laduree and they do not even compare The Macarons here are much bigger in size the outside is crispy and the inside is soft and chewy As far as price I cant compare because Ive only had Laduree once but I think the prices for the Bouchon Macarons are fair because they are bigger and not the dainty little ones Weve also had the muffins and some other fruity pastries from here as well and they were equally as yummy but those Macarons though  Overall this is a great spot to pick up some pastries they also have premade sandwiches and salad for a quick snack Not only that but they prices wont kill you like at other places on the strip,positive,133,100-150,717,500-1000
One of my all time favorites from LA Friendly service Cupcakes are on one side and ice cream on the other Outside theres a cupcake vending machine Right next to in n out so its the perfect dessert after burgers,positive,40,25-50,217,<500
I bought some cookies all of which were stale and extremely dry Its such a disappointment that they sell goods past their sell by date Perhaps this isnt the best location to visit,negative,33,25-50,184,<500
The ice cream was truly deliciousBrownies and donuts looks very delicious and nice but after we bought itIf someone didnt realized that it was rock hard a tooth couldve broken after biting into itFinding out that it was rock hard was truly sad because I was really looking forward to the brownie because i really enjoy them I hope you guys can consider my advice and switch out the brownies more to make them more freshDoing that will also keep them from getting rock hard,negative,85,75-100,481,<500
From the pastries to the food its all delicious Try the Asparagus Leek Soup Im not a soup person but this stuff is awesome Only complaint is that the line get confusing because some are there for pastries only  food and some people only want food the line gets weird because of the setup with the registers next to the pastry display I was here yesterday and many people were getting frustrated waiting in the long line only to realize they were in the pastry line This is especially confusing when its busy which Amelies tends to be since its so yummy Service is ALWAYS great everyone always willing to help you with your choices since theres so much to choose from,positive,123,100-150,684,500-1000
They have the BEST macaroons ever Pistachio is my all time favorite Not too sweet soft a little chewy and perfect every time I cant wait to go back in January and try their others flavors Im buying a bunch and taking them home ,positive,45,25-50,238,<500
Terribly long lines and irritating employees I have been here on multiple occasions and the lines keep getting worse Yes I understand this is one of the best dessert places in ChampaignUrbana but you would have thought management would have worked out a better system by nowgeez Oh and the employees oh my The lines would go so much faster and smoother if these employees got some better training Sophie took our order and lets just say that she took an insane amount of time to take our order We asked if they still had mango custard from the day before and she didnt understand our question Sophie asked us to repeat our question about six times and by the sixth time of her answering what with her valley girl accent I was done with this place Then she finally understood the question and answered oh yes we do Yes we have pineapple Oh myno Sophie I asked for mango six times not pineapple But I had 2 other custards that I wanted to order so I kept my mouth shut and just ordered It took us about 10 minutes just to order 2 peanut butter cups because Sophie couldnt understand peanut butter I live in SoCal now and even there I have never had to enunciate my words so much It was the most painful experience I have ever had Then when Sophie finally got our order it took her and her friends too long to make us our order It took us about 35 minutes to get through the drivethru line I will NEVER be returning to this beloved custard place of ChampaignUrbana Too bad because the custard is great,negative,282,250-300,1551,1500-2000
Been here several times Just dont think it lives up to the hype Yes it is a funky eclectic place but the food is not exceptional and the same things can be found in other places at a much better level of quality Enjoy standing in line for an hour for croissant,negative,52,50-75,266,<500
Walked in before 11pm staff said they were closed Yelp and iPhone maps says they are open til 11pm So the staff stated they were Closed when we and two other customers walked in before the time listed on yelp Highly disappointed Would not recommend    ,negative,49,25-50,267,<500
Went to this place when we visited Vegas for a wedding I love the show so I figured the 25 hour line was worth it Well not so much While I must admit the selection and display is beautiful I wasnt blown away by the taste of their product My cannoli cream was gritty and the shell wasnt very crisp by time I got to eat it My fudge cupcake frosting was okay but I myself make better And finally I got this cake thing it was white chocolate mousse covered with chocolate The mousse was WAY To sweet and I wish the chocolate shell would have had a crunch to it I know I bought some other items too but overall I wasnt too empresses Waiting 25 hours and paying about 30 for something that I could make or buy in Wisconsin tasting better and cheaper than this place whyd I even come Should have listened to my mom and just taken the picture outside and gotten desserts someplace else,negative,171,150-200,913,500-1000
Ive been waiting to try these donuts for the past month Reading reviews after reviews and finally said today is the day Packed my family up and headed over paid for parking and walked in Small space but loads of beautifully decorated donuts behind the case Kids got the free monster Inc donuts I ordered the strawberry split and creme brulee hubby ordered an apple fritter and the espresso donut I also wanted to try the pop tart donut and a few extras 25 later we are walking out happy to try these award winning donuts My first bite of the strawberry split underwhelming I could taste old oil along with a flavorless donut after sampling the rest of them my family came to the same conclusion the old oil taste took over the flavor of all the donuts and we were very disappointed after waiting so long to try these,negative,151,150-200,832,500-1000
Part of the charm of shopping at WSM is the interaction with colorful personalities of the appreciative vendors Its certainly not a requirement but does add to the pleasant overall experience Oddly enough happy customers buy more and return often As with many other reviews the staff at Crepes De Luxe is simply not worth dealing with and appears to be best suited for work not involved with or anywhere near people which is baffling considering its an open stand with direct customer contact If youre into subjecting yourself to confrontation arrogance and rudeness you wont be disappointed Not me once is enough,negative,103,100-150,627,500-1000
They need to train their employees to serve their customers I stood for a while trying to order once I was told where to order the employee asked me what I wanted I responded i dont know what you have She told me to look at the menu I responded where is the menu then the employee responded on the podium i turned around saw the back side of the stand no menus then the employee said it was the other side Now it was time to pay the employee told me I could look around to shop for chocolate while I waited but I had to make it as a separate purchase Interesting I was going to purchase a couple dozen gifts for my employees but decided to spend my money somewhere easier to shop The ice cream was good though,negative,142,100-150,723,500-1000
Eh its tooooo sweet and pretty pricey Good thing I sampled the cereal milk and crack pie ice cream Crack tasted like butterscotch while the cereal tasted like frosted flake blended in w ice cream Milk ice cream was ok Tried the crack pie which costed 650 and its pretty small for the price you pay Rich and sweet mixed with gooey and sugary all in one is what I described this pie,negative,73,50-75,390,<500
This ice cream is mouthwatering They have such unique flavors that taste so fresh their prices are super reasonable for the amount of ice cream you get Highly recommend,positive,29,25-50,172,<500
Definitely NOT the best donuts in the world as they claim on their box Get real Office brought in a box of them and they were just okay nothing special Had the blueberry with lemon icinggross Wont be going there on my own There are better donut options out there,negative,50,25-50,275,<500
They had a pop up store at Illumilatte so I decided to buy a bakers dozen for my office Can I just say I was the hit of the office that day Each donut was fun inventive and so so good I will definitely be going back,positive,47,25-50,219,<500
Its okay little girls serving ice cream with smiles and giggles Basic flavors basic menu thats not bad its just ice cream Family friendly Id certainly go back again and so will you,positive,33,25-50,192,<500
This place has the best waffle cone for any flavor Ice cream My favorite is the almond buttercrunch brownie swirl  rocky road,positive,23,<50,130,<500
OMG this place is the KING of delicious baked goods Hands down Everything they offered was delicious The kouign amman was something I could not pronounce and looked so unassuming and we were just blown away at how delicious it is The oreo thingy just heaven Bouchon brownies absolutely delicious I cannot say enough about this place I wished I lived in a place that has a bakery that is half as good as this place We stayed at the Venetian and their pop up bakery right when you exit the guest elevators is where the bakery was and the lines are always long Worth every minute If only I had more room in my stomach Id eat here every morning We bought a box of goodies to take back with us and it did not make it to the airport I wish I could give this place more stars because I am a big fan,positive,156,150-200,816,500-1000
The ice cream is so creamy  rich but light  refreshing all at the same time We tried several samples which were all tasty but we landed on a banana bowl with vanilla ice cream hot fudge  peanuts AND we asked for our tasty treat in a waffle bowl homemade too  it was absolutely delicious We do not live close but we will be sure to make a trip back soon for more,positive,76,75-100,377,<500
Its nice to take a break from your typical run of the mill flavors and what I loved was how natural the blueberry icecream I got tasted The little Chinese takeout box was definitely a fun way of changing things up the fortune cookie was also a cool little thing to add I would love to go back and try out the other different flavors sometime,positive,66,50-75,346,<500
This is the first place Id go whenever I got my allowance if I was a kid living near by The shop is adorable The space is very tight but its crammed full of old toys and candies that Id never seen in years They have cookies brownies some bars and of course the ice cream The pricing doesnt seem outrageous either  a 2 scoop order is just 325 or so You have the option to upgrade to waffle cone and add toppings which increases the cost a bit They also offer coffee and some drinks Love the pricing love the goods and love the toys,positive,107,100-150,547,500-1000
Came back here again for the 3rd time in less than 2 weeks and no surprise they are sold out of the milk pudding and premium milk breads We asked when will the next batch will come out and they said 4 hours This is non sense We never have this kind of issues with the other locations Corporate if you are reading this please contact the manger and get this problem fix ASAP,negative,74,50-75,379,<500
Ramen Review 010 It was in one word bland The meat had no flavor the broth had no flavor and the bowls were half empty leaving us very disappointed with our food plan this evening Ice Cream Review 410 Weve been here a few times for ice cream and the general consensus is the ice cream itself is pretty good but the price is too expensive for what you get As far as I know this is the most expensive ice cream in Ohio but certainly not the best,negative,89,75-100,455,<500
Worst ice cream Ive had in a while Think warm very milky tasting ice cream I thought considering its location it would have to be good but its so gross I want my money back Dont know how it survives,negative,40,25-50,205,<500
Thumbs down Highly overrated Went there with my date and had a piece of cake It took very long to be served and when we got our cake I was very disappointed The cake was very dry like stale bread on the bottom like it had been sitting out for a long time on the plate or something despite being told it was freshly cut And the overall quality of the cake was subpar not a treat to enjoy Also because of the other reviews raving about this spot as a cake spot I was very disappointed in the selection of cakes only a handful 4 or 5 to choose from One slice will set you back about 78 dollars with a tip 650 each which is fine if it tasted good But no Cake should not be dry flavorless bread Dont serve stale stuff It leaves a bad taste in your customers mouth literally  no one likes to be ripped off Underwhelming experience Also a suggestion for an actual menu either on paper or posted somewhere so customers can get an idea of the types of beverages the place offers would help Needs improvements in quality of service selections and quality of the products,negative,206,200-250,1104,1000-1500
This is my new goto place when I want some quality ice cream sorbet or yogurt They say it is all made in small batches using fresh local ingredients I had a small Almond Buttercrunch ice cream which was terrific and really hit the spot I could really tell that they used only the best and freshest ingredients because the taste was much better than Baskin Robins or Cold Stone ice cream My fiance got a small fruit flavored yogurt or sorbet I forget which and it was amazing It was light and tasty and you could definitely tell that it was made with fresh fruit The place wasnt too busy and the workers I think they were the owners were very friendly and helpful At about 3 for a very small cup it is pretty pricey but no doubt worth it I will hopefully be back soon to sample some of their other flavors My only regrets are that I didnt sample more of the exotic flavors and that I didnt use one of their ice cream sticks made from birch wood to eat my ice cream It makes me happy that there are still entrepreneurs out there that are willing to make a superior product with superior ingredients all the while being environmentally responsible,positive,216,200-250,1168,1000-1500
Terrible service with coffee that taste like crap No flavor syrup and suggested I should go to Starbucks downstairs Seriously Took 15 min for a latte to be made when I was the only customer at the time and they have 3 people working,negative,44,25-50,237,<500
I stopped here by chance since we were staying at the Venetian and didnt have time to have a sit down lunch that day My original plan of getting just a sandwich turned into a sandwich a raspberry macaroonwhich was surprising because I swore Id never have another one after my first taste of one from Jean Phillipe a la madeleine and a cup of fresh squeezed orange juice The orange juice was ok It had no pulp which always makes me question whether it really is fresh squeezed but it tasted fine My sandwich turkey in a sweet twisted bread was incredible Id say thats the best sandwich Ive had in my life The best part of the entire meal though was definitely the raspberry macaroon Like I said I swore against all macaroons for eternity but they just looked so pretty and scrumptious that I caved One of the best decisions of my life That cookie was everything that I imagined macaroons would be like and more The outside slightly crunchy with a soft moist center that just makes you so happy you decided not to share I couldnt shut up about this cookie and thank goodness there are a couple locations here in CA so I wont have to wait to go to Vegas every time Im craving the macaroons,positive,223,200-250,1216,1000-1500
First time here and heres my first impression The space is pretty big if youre wanting to hangout here or eat your bakery stuffs they have a wide selection of breads that it looks big and puffy but as soon as u bite into the bread it deflates so Im thinking they just used a lot yeast to make it rise I dont know I dont bake and the stuffing inside is not a lot either They have cookies and pan bread its not that good either they have teas and coffee to go with their bakery goods  So its ok but I would suggest to just get your tea to the store next door called share tea Its pretty good there so the most disappointing part here is the waiting and the cleanliness part when u get their bakery stuffs you have to get a tray and put ur own breads etc they provide you with your own tongs The price and the name of the bread are displayed While holding the breads bakery goods on ur tray you go to this long line to wait and pay while having your food exposed to cough sneeze air etcthere is no protection because they dont put plastic wraps until You get to the register where the money and all kinds of germs your food can get exposed to thee waiting in line to pay takes about 45 mins so if youre carrying your big tray with your goods depending on how heavy it could be its really annoying so when you get to the register the cashiers have to no conversation because they looked pretty beat up taking payments bagging the goods one by one and arranging them In a box Its not very efficient and they are tiredthe cashier I had said she hates it lol I understand that they make their breads goodies fresh but packing them already before putting them in the shelves is much more safer cleaner and efficient if people loves their baked good they will buy them anyways Im sure they still make it fresh everyday because it will run out some of the baked goods are gone and I can see them refilling them so to save time to save the food from Dirt packed them and provide the clients a box so they can get in and get out and they also have to make sure the breads are filled and not just air inside if its gets better I might give it another chance but if not Im good And I will not recommend it,negative,435,300- 500,2274,2000+
Must Try Macarons I wish I got the TK Oreo cookie but didnt Wah wah next time The macarons were great Vanilla was my favorite Oh and FYI eat them ASAP They kind of lose their exterior crunchiness within a couple of days I Fd up and got 2 of the boxes 2 days before I was to arrive home yeah dont do that,positive,64,50-75,326,<500
A great bakery in the heart of Little Italy It was the only place open semilate 9pm on a weeknight in the area where we could grab dessert I ended up with the cappuccino brownie and it was fantastic Some of the staples like cassata cake were already sold out but they had quite the selection of desserts still available Staff was very friendly and made each customer feel like they were at home,positive,74,50-75,402,<500
I dont understand the hype here at all honestly I understand Woo Better for you ice cream But its STILL ice cream Okay ice cream at that Maybe I am just used to the artificial flavors but Ive definitely tasted better ice cream elsewhere And if I had known I was gonna spend 10 for okay ice cream I would of just said screw it and went and got some frozen yogurt from Yogurtland thats half the price of this place The customer service wasnt there at all either I think it would of hurt the girl if she had smiled Sorry Sweet Republic I definitely will NOT be back,negative,110,100-150,581,500-1000
Delicious ice cream combined with excellent service The owners have done their research and are putting their all into this adorable little ice cream shop They have a rotating menu with several unique flavors including sorbets And if thats not enough you can add toppings or put your ice cream between a honey bun or on top of a waffle When you come here you feel like youre helping the little guy and making the world a better place Plus you get ice cream out of it so its a win win,positive,92,75-100,492,<500
too expensive 12 for an ice cream sundae its also too sweet the ice cream was so so at best really nothing to rave about,negative,25,<50,129,<500
Yummy Took the kids here for some soft serve The ice cream was soft and creamy and the fish waffles was crispy on the outside and gooey soft on the inside Check them out if you havent,positive,37,25-50,187,<500
This would have been a 3 star review but the strawberry cheesecake cupcake didnt taste anything like strawberries We purchased 2 cupcakes that being the first and a salted Carmel one being the second The salted Carmel was pretty good the cake was nice and soft but way over salted The cheesecake one only had flavor in the frosting and it wasnt strawberry thats for sure The girl helping people with the ice cream etc was very nice friendly and outgoing The girl at the counter who rang us up seemed like she might have been nice but kind of flighty We got our cupcakes to go sit outside at the table since there was no where to sit at the inside She put the cupcakes down on the counter in a box turned her back and that was it Luckily I noticed next to the register was some wooden Popsicle stick looking thing which I hoped was a knife to cut the cakes in half and luckily it was Needless to say I will NEVER give this establishment any of my money again Oh and did I mention they were just a step above Albertsons and definitely way below the Hershey shop and Nothing Bundt Cakes,negative,207,200-250,1098,1000-1500
Advice A single scoop is big enough to share See if you can ask for a half scoop of one flavour and a half scoop of another if you originally wanted to try two different flavours We got a scoop of caramelized chocolate and a scoop of the wild berry crumble and one scoop each was too much for the both of us The ice cream shop is an old theatre converted to an ice cream manufacturing facility and store front thats got a great facade drawing in a steady stream of customers on a warm summers day,positive,98,75-100,504,500-1000
Not sure what the fan fare is about It took 20 minutes of waiting on a Sunday night to finally order ice cream with staff members who didnt seem happy to be there We had half scoops of whiskey pecan and pumpkin spice The whiskey pecan could be okay if the pecans were fine ground or small chunks Pumpkin was disgusting It was like any other hard ice cream just weird flavors Very expensive,negative,74,50-75,397,<500
I ordered a chocolate bouchon one epi baguette with butter the ham and cheese sandwich and a chocolate croissant for my friend Everything was delicious They did not seem to have the cashew butterjelly sandwich that is on the websites menu WilliamsSonoma sells the bouchon mix I am considering trying it out to see if it is as good as the real thing,positive,63,50-75,358,<500
Really awesome place to go when you want ice cream Had the Blondie Sunday tonight It was the best,positive,19,<50,102,<500
Instead of 1 star Ill give this place 2stars as its not always fair for reality stars getting unrealistic expectations with their food We got the cannoli lobster tail fondant cookies and 7 layer cookie last Dec 22 at noon They were not bad but its not special I guess it was expensive because of the rent they pay at The Venetian They were mostly dry and crumbly You only go here just so you can tell your friends that youve been here The pastries were nothing special Service should have made up for it but no Only the cashier with an east coast accent was nice The rest  I dont know who hired them Their human resources should reassess their standards These girls shouldnt be customer facing They were just dry and borderline rude to customers The least they should do is to thank their customers for waiting Even those doing the cakes were snobby We are not doing them a favor There are others who would do a better job than you and actually need a job Just my 2,negative,183,150-200,994,500-1000
Pretty letdown at what looked to be an exciting new place I saw this being constructed a few months ago and wanted to give it a try Place is very very small and full of the drunken guests taking up the line asking for a million samples Meanwhile 4 other employees just stood around doing nothing really where they couldve helped me I got a sample of the fruity cereal and it was pretty gross obviously full of artificial flavoring and just left a bad after taste Finally ordered a strawberry Quake shake and a cookie The shake was a major letdown and flat of flavor Couldnt eat more than 2 bites and threw away The cookie was even worse just garbage NO flavor whatsoever That was thrown away as well Giving them 1 star for the marketing as the signs  promotional items got me really interested Unfortunately I just dont thing they serve a good product I also liked them open late but besides that Ill clearly never return,negative,171,150-200,955,500-1000
Good place to grab a quick bite and heated seating outside added a star The price of pastries were reasonable for the area Good view all around and great for people watching No I did not get their coffee because of poor reviews,positive,43,25-50,228,<500
So happy to have an authentic Filipino dessert shop near us The halo halo special was amazing The owners are so sweet and customer service is phenomenal Its hidden in the back so a little hard to find but will definitely be back Maybe next time well try the other desserts but they do have ice cream too The owner said they were rolling out ice cream flavored coffee too,positive,70,50-75,378,<500
I cant say how totally disappointed I was in going to the Vegas location of Carlos Bakery I dont gamble and Im not into Blue a man Group so for me Vegas is visiting family and getting good grub I love lobster tails and Im not talking the fishy kind Im talking the amazing east coast confection that is slightly crisp on the outside but soft and gooey and filled with a delicious custard unfortunately thats not what I got at Carlos I wished Id have tasted one before I bought 7 of them to take home to friends well I couldnt wait so on the car ride home to AZ I dug in and wished Id had a trash can to spit it back out it was awful hard beyond belief with hardly any filling and tasted so badly of old grease that I could only take that one bite I had my husband try another one hoping it was just the one and he couldnt take but one bite either the whole batch tasted like four day old leftovers yet we had only gotten them an hour before and we specifically got to the bakery early to get the freshest ones Well I think we got the oldest ones they had not going to go back here maybe when we visit friends in Jersey we will try the original shop sorry Buddy this place was terrible,negative,238,200-250,1218,1000-1500
Really disappointed Waited in long line and purchased a nice variety of desserts All tasted the same  no flavor and very processedmass produced tasting Do not recommend this bakery at all Just a tourist trap,negative,36,25-50,214,<500

Prestis cakes for special occasions are excellent The cake is tender and flavorful and the buttercream is dense and heavenly They are also decorated beautifully Cake as it is supposed to be a delicious treat not like those OTHER bakeries you know the ones with the gross frosting and plastic decorations The cafe is also very pleasant and they have such a variety of fine cookies and pastry Occasionally I have had slow service from trainees but not usually However lets admit it Corbos definitely has better cannoli Corbos also probably has fabulous cakes but they dont have yellow cake,positive,100,75-100,615,500-1000
I am surprised I only visited this place once when the elevator to our room was directly in front of this bakery stand Of course on our first trip there I ordered a bunch of sweets to last me the weekend I was happy with everything I ordered  the strawberry rhubarb pietart the strawberry croissant and the carrot cake cream cheese sandwich cookies I took a bite of the valrhona chocolate cupcake and it was very delicious I wanted to buy a ton of the carrot cake sandwiches on the way back home but I kind of knew Id eat them all at the airport so opted not to,positive,110,100-150,573,500-1000
Terrible customer service Employee asked for the next customer in line and did not wait for them to get to the counter and let someone cut in line They knew that he cut in line and when asked why they let him cut if they knew the answer was they did not know how to tell him to go to the back of the line Way to upset the other 6 people that were already in line They are skimpy with the toppings The prices are so expensive which I expected but the least they could do is give enough toppings to last through the whole sundae instead of just the first few bites,negative,114,100-150,573,500-1000
My wife and tried this place today and came out not impressed We got a cannoli and pumpkin cheesecake First off i think jack in the box has better cheesecake And her cannoli was not good at all And having been to the shop in new jersey i can say the flavors are not the same at both shops,negative,59,50-75,293,<500
What an awesome ice cream eatery Had the Mini Daddy cookie cup with mango and passion fruit sorbet and topped it off with an almond macaroon All cookie cups come with a toasted marshmallow It was delicious My husband had a Nutella and Java milkshake and really enjoyed his drink as well The interior was clean and super cute This 80s baby loved the Steve Urkel painting on the wall Jackson 5 songs were playing over the speakers so it was a fun throwback atmosphere The server who helped us was very polite and encouraged us to try all their fun flavors like the Urkel chocolate and peanut butter and Netflix and Chill vanilla with popcorn and chocolate candy Check in on Yelp and get 10 off Great deal Will be back again,positive,133,100-150,743,500-1000
Have to admit that as a HUGE fan of Cupcake Wars Ive been looking forward to eating cupcakes from here for a couple years I was immensely disappointed The flavor that they focus on in the show was not present Sad It just didnt meet up to my expectations,negative,49,25-50,261,<500
This is the best Donuts Ive ever had seriously I heard about this place when it opened it closes kinda early so I didnt make it kept putting it off eventually I made it in I went three days in a row I got two donuts each time I spent 4 5 and 9 The prices are very reasonable  the last time I was there the 9 visit I purchased the French Toast Donut it involved a grill came out hot and awesome with silverware butter syrup and jam on a plate my goodness The first and third time I went I was that around opening and it was awesome the second time I went I arrived around 1100AM They close at 1Pm  at 11 they were almost sold out Thats a positive thing This place has fresh donuts and they are delicious So get there earyish,positive,149,100-150,772,500-1000
WOW Were from the land of Ben  Jerrys and our family including two teenagers thinks this is the best ice cream weve ever had The flavors included strawberry rhubarb crisp honey lavender black Raspberry chocolate chunk and bing cherry chocolate chunk In addition they use environmentally sensitive practices for maintaining the building Worth taking another trip to Cleveland from the Champlain Valley,positive,63,50-75,416,<500
Over hyped and overpriced Went on opening daynot much of a wait to order I ordered the Greatest Hits combo and the strawberrycorn milkquake Service was fast but they did make a mistake with our order which resulted in a free sweet potato milkquake The milkquakes made only in Las Vegas are supposed to be similar to a Dairy Queen blizzard As I tried the strawberry corn milkquake my first impression likened it to a McFlurry without an adequate spoon for eating Milk Bar has flat wooden spatulas larger ones are provided with the milk quake than what is on the counter The flat spatula shape made it incredibly difficult to actually scoop the bits in the milkquake The strawberry corn milkquake was a lot thicker consistency wise in comparison to the sweet potato milkquake we also had Taste was soso as I would often get a chunk of corn cereal or blob of strawberry jellypreserve stuck in my bubble tea sized straw Presentation for the milkquake was also lacking For 10 I expected something more than a clear plastic cup with a domed lid Greatest hits combo A nice option for those who are new to Milk Bar  want to try a little bit of everything Presentation was lacking also as it comes in a basic brown paper bag partially stamped with the milk logo see attached pics Ive had take out food presented in better packaging than this The bday truffles were decent but I feel like they dont match the 3 for 6 price tag as they are very similar to a starbucks cake pop Compost cookies were not anything special either I know theyre made up of Chocolate chips butterscotch chips coffee graham cracker crust pretzels and even potato chipsbut in all honesty the flavors were muddled together and the cookie itself was drier and smaller than expected for a 3 cookie The crack pie was ridiculously SMALL Upon opening the clever cardboard packaging I was shocked to realize that I had paid 650 for a slice of pie smaller than my hand Marketed as a twist on the traditional Chess pie the Crack pie was disappointingif served independent from its wrapper i would not be able to identify anything unique about it The cereal milk soft serve is just okay a gimmicky flavor to try if you like cerealas it tastes like cap n crunch flavored milk All in all my opening day experience at Milk Bar was disappointing Presentation portions and taste just dont match the hype or cost I believe there are plenty of other better looking and better priced options for sweets in Las Vegasdont waste your dollars or calories on this one,negative,452,300- 500,2592,2000+
The atmosphere and friendly service create a sincere atmosphere As delicious as the many cookies appear in the well lit cases they are tasteless I am a baker and am consistently disappointed in the cute little nuggets of dough,negative,39,25-50,230,<500
I love the variety of flavors They have a fun twist on desserts I have come here for everything from cookies to soft serve to birthday cake I love it all its nice to have something different and unique I recommend it for anyone who can think outside the box and can appreciate different flavors I have recommended it to family and friends who have enjoyed it as well,positive,69,50-75,374,<500
Very busy and unorganized Grab a number weave your way to the display case to look at the eye candy and wait about 20 min in a small cramped shop for your number to be called I ended up getting a lobster tail California cheesecake and crumb cake Waited another 15 min for my name to be called so I can pay There isnt a line for anything so you really need to pay attention what theyre calling out Ended up being around 25 for those three items Lobster tail was eh cream was bland and the pastry was crispy to the point where it was hard California cheesecake was nothing special or unique The crumb cake was the most disappointing it tasted like a dry sponge with brown sugar lumps on top not even kidding Dont waste your time or money here,negative,143,100-150,763,500-1000
A hidden gem for sure My friend always raved about Pages and Im glad I finally got to try it I got the chocolate chip cookie sundae The soft serve ice cream is so creamy and smooooth The chocolate chip cookie is warmed before being added to your Sunday OMG mouthgasm I didnt realize how popular it was until I got there and there was a line of probably 2530 people on a Sunday night Line goes by relatively quickly and the staff are really nice despite being slammed Parking can get tricky when its crowded but people are in a out often so you can find one in a few minutes if you dont at first Also remember its cash only but theres an ATM around the corner Cant wait to come back and try something else,positive,138,100-150,728,500-1000
Ew Anyone who can bake at home following a free recipe from a cookbook or blog can produce higher quality and better tasting baked goods than this Why does this guy have a showartistic flare Stuff was pretty but Ew,negative,40,25-50,221,<500
I had Espresso Escape and it didnt have a tiny coffee flavor BELLAGIO PATISSERIE is much much better with cheaper price And the lady was ignoring about my question Totally RIP OFF at 12 more The feeling makes me never buy stuff from Ghiradelli anymore Walked long way only for this and so sad had a bad experience,negative,58,50-75,321,<500
Oh my gosh This is the bakery in my dreams I have always wanted to go on a date with my husband to a place like this and it was absolutely heavenly Everything looked delicious but we ordered two Creme BrÃlÃes one vanilla bean and one mixed fruit We also had one of their famous caramel brownies The creme brÃlÃes were torched after we ordered them so they were perfect and so creamy You could see the tiny vanilla bean caviar in the cream It was soo flavorful The brownie was like nothing Id ever had before It looked overwhelmingly sweet at first sight but when I took that first bite I immediately went for another It was crunchy on the bottom soft in the middle and caramel salty sweet on top I loved it Its too bad we dont have a place like this in Tucson Az Hint hint,positive,150,100-150,797,500-1000
We love the sprinkles in downtown Disney and decided to drive to try out the supposedly promoted 247 ATM to find out its unavailable at this location,negative,27,25-50,152,<500
This is a sweet little gem hidden in down town Phoenix If you havent been in before I definitely recommend you your partner and your friends and your dog  all head out and go get some Cookie Monster on a cone or their pecan praline was amazing too It would have been way more awesome of an experience if I wasnt too cold to sit outside and watch the free love DJ unfortunately Novel is the size of my bathroom so you cant sit in there or stand really No knocks on Novel Just keepin it real The staff are very respectful and know their shite They were pleasant and helpful Overall it was great Tad pricey but I guess you get what you pay for,positive,127,100-150,661,500-1000
Best pastries in Madison by far They run out of items within an hour after opening so you need to hurry This happens pretty consistently during the weekend so I dont know why they dont just make more Minus one star for the lack of customer service by the woman who works at the counterpicks up the phone Saturday mornings Shes pretty unfriendly and consistently has attitude when you try to place a hold order She left me on hold for over 10 mins and clearly forgot about me until I hung up and had to call back with no remorse I get that youre busy but no need to throw customer service out the window when your customers arent there inperson,positive,122,100-150,658,500-1000
Saw the hype about this place opening and finely took my grandkids Got there just after 11am so no line Took sometime for service as he was in back Got are orders in a timely manner Now they have no indoor area to sit so that leaves just a couple of benches outside  no tables  as many of the other places in town have If you have little ones I would get it to go Their ice cream was ok but not worth the drive as I noticed on their signage Next time I feel like ice cream or custard and need to drive with no place to sit Ill go to my favorite place luv it custard at LV Blvd and Oakey,negative,125,100-150,599,500-1000
My favorite ice cream place in Las Vegas In fact its the only place I go to for ice cream Truly its always fresh and delicious  Staff were always super friendly and prompt Thank you Handels for recognizing the Veterans every single year,positive,44,25-50,246,<500
The ice cream here is fabulous They have very unique flavors here  the lychee flavor in particular was delicious But the real reason I wanted to write this review was to comment on this restaurants ramen night Widely publicized in Cleveland foodie circles on Facebook this little ice cream shop decided to take on a valiant endeavor during two weekends in the winter to try to introduce authentic Japanese ramen to the Cleveland community I attended the second ramen night and I am pretty certain there will be a third While I applaud these guys for the effort I unfortunately was disappointed by their ramen The ramen broth was great the meat was great though a bit on the fatty side and I wished I had more of it and the egg nearly perfect slightly on the raw side However the noodles did them in The noodles were doughy and quite unpleasant I am hoping that for the third ramen night these will find a different source for their noodles Then Id definitely be coming back for a second helping,positive,181,150-200,1021,1000-1500

I ordered a slice of carrot cake for my birthday March 5 two weeks in advance  while they had the slice ready for me when I arrived it was the worst carrot cake I have ever had The cake was super dry  fell apart easily Very disappointing,negative,49,25-50,245,<500
Being a huge fan of Christina Tosi I was beyond excited to try Milk Bar I was sadly disappointed I got a slice of birthday cake birthday cake truffles a corn cookie and a slice of crack pie The birthday cake was my least favorite The icing had a weird lemon like flavor The birthday cake truffles were sandy in texture tasted like a birthday cake pop from Starbucks but the chocolate replaced with sand The corn cookie was extremely salty Like someone replaced the sugar with salt And the crack pie was alright It was super sweet and hard to eat more than one bite It tasted like pecan pie without the pecans With all the hype and how expensive it was I was hoping for more,negative,128,100-150,689,500-1000
Ive been a fan of Hopscotch since they opened and continue to support them during lockdown and curbsideonly pickup but think customers should be aware that theyre not quite ready to handle more than a very few customers at a time Ive had several experiences in the last few weeks where my orders were wrong or seriously delayed behind others who arrived and ordered after me so be prepared And the maskdistancing of patrons standing outside is very variable you take your chances,positive,83,75-100,491,<500

Fantastic chocolate croissant Full of flaky goodness with the perfect amount of dark chocolate inside I am obsessed with the bouchon Namesake for a reason For 2 it looks quite dinky but it is a small price to pay for the amazingness that it brings Seriously its like the perfect little chocolate cake Tried some of my cousins bread pudding As good as any bread pudding Ive ever had even though Im not a huge fan of bp to begin with The strawberry croissant though innovative was a little too sweet for my taste Dont be deceived by its flatness Even though it is a little unsightly I think youll be satisfied Had a few bites of the pistachio macaron Not bad but Id stick with the morning pastries for guaranteed satisfaction Wish I had enough timeroommoney for the TKO Thomas Keller Oreo almond brioche beignets etc etc,positive,148,100-150,856,500-1000
I went to Carlos in Vegas and I was looking forward to it I waited in line for quite a while maybe 20 or 30 minutes The boy who was ushering people in through the velvet rope was busy chatting and a couple who were never in line walked right up to the counter and were waited on I got the California cheesecake It was okay Ive had better It was 1000 I also bought a mug for 1000 They put them both in a white plastic bag that said Thank You like you get from Stop and Shop Very embarrassing having to walk around a beautiful hotel like the Venetian with a Stop and Shop bag When I met up again with my other family who went on the Gondola ride one of my couisins said Gee you would think they would want to give you at a bag with their logo on it Veryvery disappointing,negative,157,150-200,793,500-1000
The ice cream was so wonderful it was soft  sweet  the perfect amount of flavor in each bite We tried so many different flavors and literally every single one was good I got the I think it was called sugar cookie which was to die for My boyfriend got the lavender flavor I didnt try it but he did say it was so good  after every bite he took he talked about how good it was I personally couldnt get o we the real lavender pieces but he loved it NOW onto the service The 2 workers there were SO nice  explained everything  every ice cream to us which i thought was really sweet They asked us how we heard of them we told them we just ate up the street so they asked us how our dinner was  they genuinely seemed interested in our night  then THEY thanked US for allowing them to be apart of our night not just thanks for coming in which I thought was so cool Overall a good experience  will most definitely be back,positive,188,150-200,939,500-1000
I am obsessed with this place I go there at least 4 times a month since its opened I love the flavors My favorite flavor is gooey butter cake The lavender cream puff and brambleberry crisp are also great Theres not always a line but totally worth it even then The staff is always friendly and you can try all the flavors you want they never get frustrated The line goes by fairly quick,positive,74,50-75,399,<500

Well since my last review got deleted I will try this again The staff is very friendly the desserts are tasty but not worth the money that you spend Youre basically paying for the name of Cake Boss If you just went to say you had a treat from the Cake Boss guy then by all means spend your money They charged my wife for the wrong item and the cannoli that my kids got did not taste better than anything I would have found from any other pastry store for 13 the price,negative,94,75-100,475,<500
Ive been going here since they opened Theyve always been good and their flavors consistent Sometime ago I couldnt have dairy and though they dont have a huge selection of sorbets what they do have tastes amazing And creamy Once in a blue moon I might give into a craving for their Campfire Smores sundae though,positive,56,50-75,320,<500

I wanna like this place so bad I have been three times I have now tried the cookie cake and cereal milk ice cream The cookie was average but still pretty good If I return I will stick to the cookie The slice of cake was extremely expensive While is was aesthetically pleasing the taste of the icing was not my favorite The cereal milk ice cream with corn flakes was honestly the nastiest thing I have ever eaten It tastes like spoiled milk and the combined taste corn flakes with it grossed me out I just have to worn people before they spend the money If you do buy this get the insta photo then immediately throw it in the garbage Also note the cornflakes are not included with the ice cream,negative,133,100-150,712,500-1000
Had to check it out after seeing chefs table I really dont like says very much but I have to say the cereal milk ice cream and crack pie were better than they were on the small screen You know when you watch a food show and wish that you could taste it well now you can I fell in love with the cereal milk ice cream The salty corn flakes they add to the side add a much needed break from an overbearing sugar rush Deff brings you back to being a kid eating cereal but more refined And for you alcoholics like me they also make a cereal milk white Russians Just take my money,positive,117,100-150,584,500-1000
Toasted coconut with salted carmel Do it Thats all I am going to say Oh and the Macaroons,positive,18,<50,94,<500
If youve ever thought that strawberry shortcake wasnt an appropriate breakfast food but wanted to do it anyways get the strawberry split This was by far my favorite of the donuts The cream brÃlÃe was a close second The glazed sugar on top gives a perfectly satisfactory crack when hit andor when bitten into and the filling was delicious We purposefully visited on the weekend for the expanded menu and of the specials chose the French toast donut which did not disappoint Well try the grilled cheese on a later visit I suggest you do the same Or take enough people that you can order all the donuts and do a sampling The staff was very friendly and the donuts yummy They are open until they sell out so get there early,positive,132,100-150,743,500-1000

This was the longest wait Ive had for an ice cream cone Also the most Ive paid for one Almost 10 for an ice cream cone Nothing to write home about This was a miss for me,negative,37,25-50,176,<500
Loved this place While standing in line trying to decide what to order the woman behind the counter asked me if she could help me choose I told her I was deciding between a cookie and soft serve and once I decided on the soft serve she handed me a cookie on the house The cereal milk soft serve with the cornflake topping was delicious and not too sweet The cornflake marshmallow cookie had a very different taste from what I was expecting but it was moist and delicious The only downfall of this place is the price 6 for that tiny soft serve but the free cookie made up for that I guess I would definitely recommend trying this place,positive,121,100-150,647,500-1000
Idk its not that great quality pastries And the prices make me less excited They get a gold star for the atmosphere though,negative,23,<50,131,<500

What can I say This place is just money Weve come here several times and just keep coming back despite the fact it isnt that close to homebut it is always worth the drive The adventurous flavors make this place really interesting compared to other places in town  truly creative some example are Chocolate Rosemary Watermelon  Chocolate Chip Blue Cheese and Fig my wifes new addiction and many many others have no fear plenty of traditional flavors as well Foodies will love this place The owner is so sweet too  she really makes the experience special My wife has a sweet tooth and a passion for ice creamgelato and this is pretty much the only place she ever wants to go anymore and weve been to a lot,positive,131,100-150,734,500-1000

Amelies is an amazing French bakery with a vast assortment of pastries breakfast items and coffee They easily beat out any French bakery in Raleigh and I knew I had to bring home as many treats as I could For breakfast I had the twice baked almond croissant It was so crunchy on the outside yet so buttery and soft on the inside it was twice baked perfectly and easily one of the best croissants Ive had I also got a latte and it was very strong I love the design they put on top of it as well a very elegant presentation I also tried the apple and strawberry kiwi fruit tarts Both were really good and the French cream was so smooth The salted caramel brownie was also amazing Salty and sweet gooey and crunchy everything you would want in a dessert The chocolate filled Ãclair and cream puffs were also classics cant go wrong with either The chocolate mousse torte was also decadently smooth and rich with cocoa flavor Overall everything I tried was really good You cant go wrong with any of their pastries and desserts Amelies is an absolute must every time I go to Charlotte now,positive,202,200-250,1115,1000-1500
Fresh baked goods Im here to talk about their Stromboli The meat one super delicious The spinach  sausage even better than the meat one Their pizzas are almost like Sicilian style Thick crust and very traditional Guys when they ask you if you want the red sauce trust me say YES you definitely want it Its probably the best Ive tasted in little Italy Their cannolis are also fresh and flavorful without being to sweet So lucky to have this place in my back yard,positive,86,75-100,481,<500
I stopped here for the first time last night and I cant believe how rich the vegan chocolate cake is The slices are very big and enough to share for two on a date The vegan chocolate slice was more flavorful than most other normal cake Ive had the couch in the front corner is also very comfortable,positive,58,50-75,307,<500

Biggest disappointment in Vegas was paying over 3 each for stale hard macarons and I had two different flavors so it wasnt just one bad batch The people working there were super friendly but considering I walked a mile out of my way to try the macarons I was really disappointed Maybe I just caught them on a really off day but these were some seriously bad macarons,negative,68,50-75,378,<500
Save your money and time there are far more delicious desert places on the strip I wanted to like it so badly but we threw away most of what we purchased The lobster tails were so hard you could barely bite through them the rainbow cake was mediocre and we also got a cupcake that was so so dry It seems like the quality just isnt there and its a shame because it could be so much better The service was good but the process isnt efficient at all You pick your deserts then another line to pay then another line to wait for your items,negative,106,100-150,547,500-1000
Before my flight home I decided I wanted something sweet and what better place than a Sprinkles cupcake Because I am unfamiliar with the area I parked at the Caesars parking garage and walked to the cupcake shop I select my cupcakes and hand my debit card to the cashier She then asked to see my ID I told her I dont have my ID  I left it in my rental because the Sprinkles that I go to often to in Northern California or the one Ive visited in Beverly Hills a few times never asked for my ID She then goes to ask a shift manager if she can accept my debit card She comes back and says no she needs a photo ID of some sort I was extremely heated because I had 20 minutes to return my rental and had to walk all the way to the Parking garage empty handed About a few days later I realized I could have used the ATM outside of the shop,negative,172,150-200,852,500-1000

Tourist trap Used to be good to your palette and your pocket a long time ago now half the stuff you buy is overpriced and old and tastes like refrigerator If you get one of their good items youll think its great and want to go back but its really hit or miss Fine if you need a quick piece of pizza If you want better quick Italian food thats worth what you pay go to Murray Hill Market down the street,negative,82,75-100,414,<500

Wowin an Im so sad and disappointed and broke way The selections were not very interesting compared to some of the really cool flavors they used to do I hadnt been here in forever so I was really looking forward to trying something new and interesting SO overpriced and bland The cherry rhubarb had absolutely no fruit flavor the sichuan chocolate was badvery bad and the HopKnot was bitter My husband had the almond buttercrunch which was good but not any better than Blue Bunny for sure and for 10 for two doubles I really dont think we will be back Going to stick with gelato from now on,negative,109,100-150,615,500-1000

My wife and I seriously loved it here The outside reminds me of a big backyard that you just want to hang out at Im sure it gets super fun when its a Friday or Saturday night But lets get down to the ice cream The ice cream donut sandwich concept is seriously godsend While Ive had it in New York Vegas and California it is just as amazing every time And the fact that they serve it with the donut warmed up is even more amazing My wife got the Cookie Monster ice cream donut sandwich and I had the caramel toffee flavor ice cream with a topping of Cookie Crisp cereal Wow Just wow Prices are very fair as well I cant even imagine how busy this place gets but we loved it and will definitely be back They are super friendly and its just a fun atmosphere,positive,150,100-150,778,500-1000
I love the flavors they have My favorites are very sweet to be honest with you which are their carrot cake and coffee and krispy creme Their carrot cake has bits of cream cheese frosting and carrot cake with carrot shred and a hint of coconut I taste Their coffee and krispy kreme has actual big krispy kreme donut pieces in them and the coffee flavor is a great base Im knocking out stars because you can only get 2 scoops or more 8 or so for two They dont sell 1 scoop ice cream Their candied apples are like 715 which I cant justify spending on but I get it its Vegas Also their customer service could use improvement but their flavors save them,positive,125,100-150,674,500-1000

Hopscotch bakery is such a delightful place to go when you need some pickmeup goodies I have tried their cupcakes flourless chocolate cake not pictured and lemon bars By far I think their sliced chocolate cake is the BEST chocolate cake I have ever had in my life I dont understand how the cake can be so soft and light when it is flourless Their coffee is also fantastic I would love to know what kind of coffee grounds they use so I can make some at home Their whole cake is also delicious and gorgeous I attached a picture of a cake order that I placed a couple of months ago for my boss I think I paid extra for the fancy cake decor but it is definitely worth the money if you are getting a cake for a special occasion or if you are extra like me haha The bakery also has coffee beanstea leaves stationery goods fresh flowers sometimes and other home goods such as candles for sale The vibe is so cozy and bright that it brightens up my day every time I visit However parking is very small and limited,positive,195,150-200,1036,1000-1500
The Milk Bar has finally arrived in Las Vegas with all the hype surrounding Christina Tosi the Crack Pie Birthday Cake and the cereal milk I was thrilled with anticipation in fact I even watched dessert clips to get pumped up When the moment arrived I was met with disbelief and confusion The experience factor took a dive similar to how Wile E Coyote falls off the cliff as hes chasing road runner I felt the portions were small for the exorbitant prices they were asking for the products 7 for a kiddie size soft serve and 650 for a mini slice crack pie is ridiculous I thought they both tasted great but not at that price point Whats worse was it was presented in paper cups and cardboard envelopes for a minute I thought I was at Mcdonalds I wish I couldve tried the birthday cake but they did not offer slices only in a whole Also no adequate seating I noticed a few lounge sofas across from me It was crowded people were sitting having cocktails I felt awkward eating ice cream around them I cant imagine this being Christinas vision as having that nostalgic ice cream experience this is far from it fortunately there are other options in Cosmopolitan that I do enjoy,negative,216,200-250,1205,1000-1500
Milk in NYC was a lot cheaper Vegas overpriced Located on the second floor food area of Cosmo Walk up shop Service was friendly You can sample the ice cream flavors Compost Cookie Soft Serve w Cornflake Crunch  6  150  Thick and milky soft serve Had the milk and cookie flavor Cornflake Crunch was a good topping but you only get a few pieces on top and it falls off easy I wish they would have layered it in the actual cup with the soft serve Good but so overpriced for what you get Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmellow Cookie  4  Comes prepackaged now Back when they were small time in NY they were baked fresh everyday Not sure how fresh these were,negative,127,100-150,676,500-1000
Very over hyped bakerycafe The decor is hideous although many people will call it abstract It looks as if you bought chairs and tables from 10 different garage sales and put them all in one location The desserts were not bad but not great either Ordered two desserts and two iced coffees when I visited The desserts were served promptly but the girl with orange hair that served the iced coffee couldnt be bothered as she was on her phone,negative,80,75-100,451,<500
Great ice cream I got the matcha tea I cream but two issues 1 came a with chocolate pocky sticks instead of matcha 2 greatly expensive I bought 2 for 16 Definitely not a great deal But at the end of the day they at least deserve 4 stars because I was impressed with the taste,positive,56,50-75,284,<500
I visited this location with my family  inlaws My inlaws are middle eastern My inlaws were speaking arabic  i noticed the staff making faces towards them They asked for any samples  staff said we dont give out samples They proceeded to shop  bought 100 worth of product Staff did not provide a bag We asked for a bag  staff said they dont have any WHEN we clearly can see the bags We all had to carry all the product back to Venetian where we parked  walked from The next day i called in  asked for a manager I explained the situation to him  he barely apologized I asked him about the samples  he said we used to hand out freely but policy changed We give to whomever asks Guess my inlaws dont deserve samples I then asked him if they ran out of bags  whats scenario is somebody spends 100 in the store He said they had bags  dont know why staff said that I usually visit this Ghiradelli once a month  used to visit it when it was next door to Imperial Palace Thats over 15 years of visits I love ice cream  Ghiradelli was my main choice but no longer Manager of this location should be ashamed of himselfherself  should replace his racist staff I wont visit Ghiradelli any longer nor tell visitors to go there I will share this experience with my friends in SF as well,negative,254,250-300,1308,1000-1500

Absolutely awful experience here recently Came in and saw a line forming in front of a register near the entrance Stood around until we realized no one was taking orders there and youre supposed to order at the dessert counter Why have a register there Why no signage to adequately direct people ANYHOW walked over to the dessert counter to check out what they had and someone came to ask if we needed help Since we werent ready yet she walked away and started building boxes Once we WERE prepared to order there was no one around to help Finally someone appears and I ordered a lavender lemon macaron and my friend went with the pecan sticky bun The person helping us grabs my macaron with parchment paper puts it on top of the counter without saying anything and walks away to grab my friends sticky bun So I assume Im supposed to grab it from the counter and do just that I grabbed it with the paper by the way When she comes back she lowkey shades me for taking my macaron and doesnt let me put it on top of the counter again for her to box because germs Okay weird that youre so concerned with germs when youre not wearing a mask Anywho we sit down and my friend and i decide the sticky bun needs to be warmed since it wasnt super fresh When she asks the same person that had helped us earlier they say that they cant take the sticky bun that we hadnt even touched to warm because of germs but can sell us another one Hmmmm why wouldnt you ASK patrons if they want certain pastries warmed before boxing them if you know that the germs are SO RAMPANT you wont be able to do so after the fact And again hilarious that germs are such a concern when not a single soul working there was wearing a mask or hairnet On top of the terrible service the pastries were also not worth the price Save yourself the agony of this wreck and hit up The Batchmaker instead Incredible FRESH baked goods with way better service,negative,364,300- 500,1966,1500-2000

I was walking on strip few days ago and I see Bouchon Bistro I love french pastries so I go in to get 2 croissants Total was 750 Ive paid with my debit card Today I see a charge of 13 which means that the Phillipina clerk rewarded herself a tip of 550 So beware when paying always have cash for small purchases or youll give greedy people direct access to your bank account Five dollars isnt much but if you overcharge all people who pay by card then it adds to thousands of dollars I used to live in Hawaii and this was a common practice for clerks to supplement their incomefraudulently overcharge people,negative,115,100-150,633,500-1000
on a recent trip a friend said to stop by and try the donuts and give him my thoughts well not a fan of the two donuts i had first i was surprised by the size of the donuts huge almost too big i am not sure you can call them donuts doughnut planet in nyc has big doughnuts but these were far bigger the variety was varied and all interesting but the two i selected were flavorless vanilla bean and boston creme the cakes of both had no flavor but the filling of the boston creme was delicious the shop is cute enough and the people friendly but please donut bar invest in paper bags for the donutswalking out of the shop with two donuts in a box seems like such a waste and not what the earth needs,negative,140,100-150,735,500-1000
This place had an assortment of different kinds of cool donuts The interesting thing is that their hours say an opening time but instead of a closing time it says they close whenever they sell out of product for the day That ensures they are fresh everyday and dont sell day old donuts Its a small shop and can get pretty hectic when its breakfast or lunch time so prepare to wait in line Donuts were very moist and full of flavor,positive,82,75-100,441,<500

No breads  just drinks We got the iced taro lavender latte with boba and mango strawberry smoothie with lychee jelly which were both wayyyy too sweet For the taro lavender latte I tasted absolutely no hints of lavender  just taro and sugar from the boba which I was pretty disappointed with The mango strawberry smoothie had no reminiscent of mango and the lychee jelly just made it way too sweet Although the toppings did make the drinks overly sweet the drink itself did not match the description and I would not get again,negative,95,75-100,532,500-1000

I came here yesterday to try it out for myself and see what all the hype was about I can say I wasnt disappointed The place has a great atmosphere and colorful theme that cultivates an inviting environment The only reason Im giving this place 4 out of 5 stars is because their ice cream is slightly expensive for my liking Given that they use quality ingredients and produce innovative delights unlike many other ice cream parlors it ends up being a tad bit pricey,positive,85,75-100,472,<500

Pricey but pretty good treats Ive been to the LA location a few times and I probably prefer this location better I am usually a fan of their cookies and ice cream The last time I came here was when I stayed at the Cosmo I do not drink dairy and asked them to make a Milk and Cereal Latte for me with something non dairy So I guess they couldnt with that option so I went with their regular size Birthday Cake Latte with almond milk instead 650 I didnt think it was anything super special but it was good and I was glad I got it I also got their Gluten Free Birthday Cake Truffle which I highly recommend 6 It comes prepackaged with three truffles inside The packaging is cute and they were SO GOOD I definitely recommend them I do appreciate that they have nondairy options and gluten free options available when not many dessert places do I also like that most of their sweets are pretty good but just pretty pricey,positive,176,150-200,941,500-1000
I know people really love this place I wish I could be one of them On the one hand I absolutely love the decor and the ambiance On the other hand I have never been anything but underwhelmed by their food The coffee is great but the bakery items are only visually appealing I have heard from most patrons that the Salted Caramel Brownie is amazing but Ive never tried it because Im not a big caramel fan So if you are Id recommend trying it I definitely think you should go here just to experience the atmosphere but dont expect to be impressed by the food Its probably great as a dessert stop after a few dinner cocktails though So thats something,negative,123,100-150,672,500-1000

Ugh I feel terrible only giving a two star but unfortunately Milk Bar just did not live up to my expectations I was like that crazy girl who stalks her prey on the internet before finally committing to findmeet the person or in this case restaurant in real life I watched Mind of a Chef I bought the cook books I follow on Instagram So last time I was in Vegas and found out they opened a location it became clear that the time had come First the line was long Meh Ive been to Disneyland I dont care But then when I finally got to order I felt really rushed and flustered Maybe it was just butterflies But then It took FOREVER for them to deal up some soft serve with cereal sprinkled on and it was good but not great It was SO much sugar And I know sugar I live for sugar I eat candy for breakfast I put maple syrup on almost anything But there was something that was just not there for me And the same could be said for the cookies and milk shake we ordered One of the cookies was good But the other two were down right bleh And on top of everything this ish is expensive If Im going to spend that much and wait that long then that monkey better get to dancin,negative,233,200-250,1191,1000-1500
This was a disappointing bowl of ramen especially for the price The soup lacked flavor but the toppings didntunfortunately they werent flavors worth tasting shoutout to the saltiest mushrooms in the Midwest To top it off everything was cold If youre going to come here I hope its for ice cream not soup,negative,53,50-75,319,<500
Subpar ice cream taste and water downed coffee in the affogato I do not recommend The toasted marshmallow was unique and prob the best part of it,negative,27,25-50,148,<500
So so oooooooo disappointing this place besides the long wait time the staff is rude and pushy to take the order now as a customer and a fan I expected more from this bakery I have always watched the tv show and the pastry look really good but no not at all in this location the cannoli filled with vanilla was not good is was simple no taste now before that I ask one of the staff that was controlling the line what was her suggestion and which one she recommended she simply said oh sry I havent tried anything yet am new I just been working for around a month wow Carlo bakery you need to let your employees try your pastry how can they recommend or say to customer which item is good if you dont let them try it before the consumer,negative,145,100-150,737,500-1000
Even just the smell of Jenis confirms its gonna be good Delicious ice cream and great job with touchless transaction YUM,positive,21,<50,124,<500
Wow wow wow What a great area at University area A glazed doughnut filled with ice cream then deep fried Wtf Why does it have to be soooo good Well done great area and a line out the door,positive,39,25-50,199,<500
Nice cozy place inside Very friendly welcoming staff Selection was not big but we did go close to closing time so understandable She threw in a few freebies for us which was really nice of her The big donuts are very nice and fluffy kind of a cake texture Not heavy or greasy The creme brulee and Nutella are also very delicious Parking was pretty easy but we did go on a Tuesday They have street meter parking and its very close to the old strip if you decide to park at one of the casinos Definitely a must try,positive,100,75-100,523,500-1000
To be quite honest the desserts here are mediocre My bf said this was apparently really good and lines were out the door so while dinning at momofuku we had the option of trying Milkbar via the restaurant We had the bday cake truffle and crack pie Crack pie was alright but it wasnt mind blowing The bday truffle which is a ball of dough was just odd Everything was way too sweet and I didnt find it to be very special,negative,82,75-100,433,<500
I love this place Too bad I cannot visit everyday Anyone who lives in surrounding areas should visit and indulge,positive,20,<50,116,<500
Cute little independent ice cream shop in the middle of an artsy row of houses Being from out of town we just used yelp to find a dessert place around Pizzeria Bianco In a winter afternoon in November it was a nice stroll from the Pizzeria to Melt The flavors are very seasonal as I was able to get sweet potato pecan and pumpkin pie How inventive Generous scoop sizes were also a plus Easy street parking around the area,positive,80,75-100,430,<500
Ive been to the location in San Diego and thought it was just OK SO I have been looking forward to trying Vegas location out I was pretty disappointed The donuts didnt seem fresh They seemed almost stale  The famous French toast was just OK I wasnt expecting just a soggy warm donut Prices high and just not worth it I wouldnt recommend or go back to either location at this point,negative,73,50-75,392,<500
I really wanted to love this place but if you have dietary restrictions or allergies you may want to rethink Im vegan and am allergic to dairy and eggs and came looking to get sorbet I politely asked the lady if the Blue Spirulina one was vegan because its in the same section as all of the vegan sorbets She said yes and so did the other person working so I ordered it After ordering it I had a weird gut feeling so I called the other location to ask the same This person AGAIN told me there was absolutely no dairy in this sorbet So I eat it only to find my stomach in shambles a few hours later I DMed the company and they told me it has both eggs and dairy I have an IGg reaction to these foods and ended up in the ER over it So incredibly disappointing and quite traumatizing actually If youre going to have options for those with allergies and restrictions at least train your staff to know which options are suitable for who Ridiculous,negative,183,150-200,965,500-1000
We stopped for dessert with friends and thought Butterwood was such a quaint little bakery with really unique flavor combinations The atmosphere was super cozy and more like being a guest at someones home than being in a bakery The employee was friendly The desserts were like nothing I had ever had before Typical bakeries have chocolate and vanilla but Butterwood uses unique flavors that were delicious We tried the mini chocolate cake with Strawberry whipped cream the olive oil orange cake with strawberry icing the fig cake and apricot cake with pistachio icing The cakes are definitely denser than what I was used to more like pound cake Everything was very flavorful The cakes were moist and the icing wasnt too sweet Such a nice little place to stop and loved that they are open late,positive,137,100-150,808,500-1000
The cappacino was good The chocolate croissant was delicious They have a regular coffee and croissant deal for 500 Its a bit pricey and dont confuse it with the restaurant which is on the 10th floor of the Venetian,positive,39,25-50,222,<500
AMAZING Growing up in Vegas we used to stop at Winchells on our way to school I tend to compare todays word of donuts to those of my bomb ass childhood Anyway the cream filled chocolate bars at Donut Bar are to die for They have an awesome and creative assortment of donuts so there is something for everyone The best part of our stop was the iced lattes Good Lord the coffee here is incredible I live way up in Summerlin but I can honestly see myself take a spin to Downtown Vegas just for some of their donuts and crazy good iced lattes While we felt prices were a bit steep I guess you get what you pay for as we Cesar Q and I left happy and wanting more The staff is outgoing and quite helpful when you dont know exactly which donut to indulge in There is street parking right our front of the shop so its very easy to run in and out Damn as I write this review I feel the need to go NOW for my afternoon pickmeup,positive,185,150-200,947,500-1000
I went in about 20 minutes ago The girls in there made you feel so unwelcomed The girl taking our order basically rolled her eyes at us when we asked if we could look at the cupcakes once the people ahead of us were done Any question was just an annoyance to her Then they forgot a lot of our pastries I dont know how she couldve forgotten when she wrote it all down But they definitely didnt forget to charge us for it Its not with going in unless you want someone treating you like youre bothering them,negative,99,75-100,519,500-1000
The quintessential Pittsburgh ice cream destination Dont let the long line and parking deter you The menu is overflowing with options and everything is delicious Prices are amazing and portions are generous They only accept cash and have an ATM onsite you can use,positive,44,25-50,270,<500
Love love love their Napoleon sheet cake Best Ive found in charlotte Its quite large wish it was a bit smaller For calorie purpose Everything is quite pricey but worth it Also tried the macaroons relish Also a nice place to hang well if we didnt have the kids,positive,49,25-50,269,<500
so i come on a friday at 1130 pm and of corse the place is decently busy and they only have like 3 flavors really the cupcake atm isnt working so its my birthday i get a free one but it looks dryed out and the icing looks scraped off sigh super annoying plus there was only one person working so you have to wait 510 minutes,negative,67,50-75,337,<500
Im not even vegan but enjoy an occasional vegan meal but these doughnuts are popping Man I will stand in line waiting outside again for these I love the menu changes every month too This place is awesome,positive,38,25-50,213,<500
Living in Florida gets depressing when you dont have access to these sweet glorious donut wonders And whoever rated these anything less than 5 stars Shame on you,positive,28,25-50,165,<500
This place was fantastic Took the kids and it was a real treat Vegas people this is a must,positive,19,<50,93,<500
Wow just had a cinnamon cupcake and its probably the best Ive ever had Tasted just like a snickerdoodle cookie Dont miss this spit on the LINQ Promenade Its full of little hidden gems,positive,34,25-50,192,<500
Coffee shops are my favorite places Give me a good coffee shop and Ill be a happy camper I can say without a doubt that not only is Amelies fantastic but its my favorite shop Ive ever been in Their coffee is great but possibly superseding their beverages including their teas and French soda is each and every pastry Ive had thus far Id heard reviews of their salted caramel brownie for months prior to going and it lives up to the hype However for me their Napoleon is worth the drive there Though the lines are long the wait is unbelievably worth it Best French pastries Ive ever had,positive,110,100-150,611,500-1000
I was disappointed by the staff When I went to the shop there was one other person in the shop I knew exactly what I wanted and stood at the cash register for over 5 minutes while the three staff members stood around having a discussion or playing on their phones before they acknowledged me Not exactly professional The treats I had were delicious but the entire experience was brought down by the staff who couldnt even describe what flavors they had of truffles When asked it was simple I dont know these with a point at where they were located The point of me asking was that some of them were not labeled,negative,114,100-150,624,500-1000
I know this place doesnt need another positive review but Im giving one anyway Its awesome There are so many great flavors of ice cream here it was tough to make a decision as to what to have However I realized that it doesnt matter what you have because its all fabulous I got a miniscoop and appreciated that they offer a small option for when you just crave a little treat I dont often have excuses to come to Cleveland but Im going to try to do so in the future just to go to Mitchells  fantastic,positive,99,75-100,519,500-1000
Watch out people First they dont honor your Yelp freebies AND they have an attitude AND the vegan coconut ice cream tastes like sugar water No flavor at all AND its EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE EXPENSIVE The young lady taking my order must have been in a place where she couldnt hear what I ordered I looked at the menu board and thought I ordered a cup with one scoop of ice cream and another cup with two scoops of ice cream I also had a free topping She distinctly told me that chocolate chips could not be swirled in I had no idea what she was talking about I said OK put the chocolate chips on the side thats OK for me She shook her head yes I ordered two scoops of ice cream for my other half And we were supposed to get another free topping with our Yelp Checkin Then she rang up my bill at 1586 I thought well four dollars for one scoop and six dollars for two scoops How does that equal 1586 I showed the cashier the bill and she rerang it up as 1186 Another little girl from behind the counter came up looked at my receipt and just said Nooooooooooo while shaking her head I was still confused but I went ahead and went with it I found out later from watching and listening to other customers ordering what they do is they take the topping and mix it in through some machine and charge a whole lot more money for that But how was I supposed to know that was my first time there My advice is ask questions before ordering Especially if its your first time because nothing was explained to us and it was our first time I personally will never come back here To me a customer and their service to a customer should come first I believe we were treated unfairly and to eat ice cream in such an environment where I am treated this way does not feel respectful or comforting which is the whole idea of going for ice cream to me,negative,356,300- 500,1877,1500-2000
Its over priced and the flavors arent very good Walk a little further and you get to two scoops Its flavorful and reasonably priced Dont waste your time at jenis,negative,30,25-50,170,<500
Really Really Really Wow The best icecream place in the world Nuf Said,positive,13,<50,76,<500
I love Amelies It is one of the first places I ever went to when I moved to Charlotte and I still get excited every time I go Being a student when I first moved I spent maaaaany 24 hour periods at Amelies and we got very well acquainted I have probably tried almost every deliciously amazing treat they serve Their sandwiches have always been on point and I of course love the salted caramel brownie macarons chocolate croissants and my serious obsession  the eclair I went through a really unhealthy two weeks of eating two eclairs a day because I was so obsessed and they are THAT good To my excitement they opened a small little express Amelies uptown and one treat they always have are the eclairs  thank goodness The decor is fun there is plenty of seating the people watching is great and the coffee and treats are fantastic I think its almost impossible to not walk out without a smile on your face maybe a sugar coma too but its worth it Only catch is that on a weekend night expect to wait in a serious line as its clearly always the place to be,positive,201,200-250,1085,1000-1500
This was my first time here It was super busy but the cashier happily told me popular items and picked out an item for me based on my preferences Cute little spot for a cute little dessert,positive,37,25-50,192,<500
We ordered the Crack Pie Milkquake Was awesome Nice in the sense that you dont need a lot to enjoy it given the flavor was rich,positive,26,25-50,131,<500
WE NEVER SKIMP thats a lie Ive been to Handels multiple times and have enjoyed great service knowledgeable staff and great portion sizes However I was very upset with my most recent experience The employee was untrained so he was not familiar with the menu and gave us portions that were half the size of everyone one else around us When I had asked for my ice cream to be served in a sugar cone instead of a dish he said that it would be an extra charge even though it says that the Tuesday special includes a sugar cone and Ive never been charged extra for a sugar cone in my past visits He also was not familiar with what the Boston Cooler was and when we asked for a Boston Cooler with banana cream pie ice cream he was confused what it was and instead of clarifying if that was not doable he charged us for both the float and the ice cream separately Usually when we receive our ice cream it fills up the entire cup and then some and our portion was a tiny measly scoop that filled up half the cup at best They really need to train their employees better before putting them at the front of service Having this terrible experience due to an untrained employee has greatly tainted my view of this place Ice cream was pretty good tho,negative,237,200-250,1260,1000-1500
Ive been living in Charlotte for almost three years and never reviewed this place until now I will say that you must visit this place Its rare to find a spot to bring your laptop and eat savory sweets so peacefully at 3 am Not sure if the Waffle House counts  Not only is the food awesome but the interior is great too Definitely worth your time,positive,68,50-75,355,<500
The customer service and the donuts were awesome I traveled from Lake County with my family and it was well worth the trip The doughnuts were well made and tasty,positive,30,25-50,164,<500
If you can find this shop located in the Venetian Hotel location kind of hidden away its subpar at best  greatly overpriced for what you get I got cannolis white chocolate covered strawberries  an MM cookie Im Italian so I know what an amazing cannoli tastes like  this was just okay The filling had a very grainy texture but the shell was done well The strawberries did not taste fresh  they were actually very mushy once you broke through the chocolate shell The only reason Ill give this place 2 stars is because the cookie was good but I dont think the majority would like them I love a crispier crunchy cookie to a soft one which is what I got Customer service here was good but quick which is understandable with their level of fame I wouldnt go back I would give their original East Coast location a shot because I know how Vegas an commercialize something  take away from the authenticity,negative,168,150-200,925,500-1000
Always a delicious treat to snack on Love their drinks desserts  teas Never a long wait  love the vibe of the place its very different,positive,27,25-50,142,<500
Not very happy I really should have got my 800 back for the worst banana split ever Who dosnt put hot fudge or chocolate or Pineapple or strawberry or somthing On a split ice cream nuts cool whip was it had to ask for a cherry and sprinkles because my 4 year old was so disappointed  ice cream was fair not worth 800 They need better customer service They need to clarify a banana split comes striped,negative,78,75-100,425,<500
I was surprised to this is a walk up place with no seating We went on a weekend evening and the line was 10 minutes long easy They had two windows open taking orders and moved through the line efficiently there was just a lot of people The ice cream was amazing Highly recommend and the line is worth it,positive,60,50-75,309,<500
The edible cookie dough is HORRIBLE I didnt read the ingredients first took a bite and thought it tasted just like butter THEN I read the ingredients and its basically just butter and shortening I took one bite each of two flavors then my wife did the same and we literally threw three tubs into the trash,negative,57,50-75,315,<500
Very good ice cream however the scoops are extremely small for a 395 single They are probably half to a third of what I would expect in a single serve and the ones we received are not even close to what is shown in the photo gallery,negative,47,25-50,237,<500
Had occasion to try the fudge brownie salted caramel oatmeal cookie red velvet cupcake pumpkin cupcake and cinnamon sugar cupcake so far You really cant go wrong here but that red velvet cream cheese frosting is particularly YOMNOMNOMNOMONMNMNMNOMMNOM One caveat is that I have no idea at all what they charge for this stuff since Ive been getting it free through a work thing thus the gluttony I might balk at the prices if I knew what they were but since I dont welp 5 stars,positive,86,75-100,491,<500
Completely a fan of this place Everyone is complaining about the wait but we got in and out in less than 10 minutes and we went on a wednesday afternoon For sure worth the wait The lobster tails are mind blowing Cannolis delicious and the cupcakes YUM I would for sure go back and I had been waiting awhile to try some of the cake boss goodies and it turned out to be everything I expected and more Stop with the bad reviews about the wait because on the show there is always a wait as well,positive,97,75-100,506,500-1000
Im not sure what the fuss is all about with this place The coffee is marginal and the baked goods almost as good as the coffee,negative,26,25-50,131,<500
OMG Soooo good Hot and tired from walking the strip Swing through the Cosmopolitan Hotel and stop by Milk Bar You have to get a cereal milk soft serve I got cereal milk with corn flakes It was awesome My wife had the compost cookie with hot fudge It did not disappoint The best part was just as we thought we were full we found additional toppings at the bottom of our cupswe just couldnt help but to eat it all Refreshing not just because we were hot and the ice cream was cool but because the flavors were amazing Next visit need to try the cookies and amazing looking cake slices,positive,112,100-150,600,500-1000
I ordered the pear dessert crepe listed on the menu YUK The rock hard pear was put put in the crepe unpeeled Two bites and thew the mess out YUK,negative,30,25-50,149,<500
How dare you charge 14 for a single slice of cake and not even try to make it taste good or fresh I am personally outraged and count this among the worst transgressions in a year of terrible injustices occurring daily Honestly if I wanted something tiny that tasted like shit and wasted my money and left me disappointed I would call my ex,negative,64,50-75,343,<500
Ghirardelli has a huge following Which is why I expected to be blown away with how good their ice cream and chocolate was But although presentation was beautiful the whipped cream and fudge was just too sweat and made me feel nauseated I guess when it comes to ghridelli will just stick to their chocolate squares with sea salt caramel instead of their fancy ice cream desserts,positive,67,50-75,381,<500
Not impressed Chocolate shake was watered down ice cream and the cookies scoop was really sweet not flavorful It was unique but not memorable Wouldnt come back and the location is TERRIBLE,negative,32,25-50,194,<500
milk ice cream tasted like milk kinda interesting compost cookie was just okay i asked for it to be warmed but it was wasnt warmed properly,negative,26,25-50,145,<500
I cant say enough great things about this place My aunt recommended this place since she said the ambiance was very cute and the food was great She was SO RIGHT As soon as you walk in youre transported into a different world that is so unique and warm They have so many different dessert and drink options And the food was so fresh and delicious I tried the turkey and brie and it was absolutely delicious For dessert I indulged in an apple pie which was the perfect ending to a great meal There are plenty of places to sit and I noticed there were several group meetings going on The place is also open 24 hours Just perfect I look forward to visiting again soon,positive,127,100-150,679,500-1000
Ill start off this review by saying this place needs to make some adjustments to their staff I was just in here with my boyfriend and little sister and we were looking at all of the flavors trying to decide what to get mind you we had only been in here for a few minutes at this point so I told the man behind us in line that he could go in front of us because we werent ready yet The man started to place his order and the staff member CASEY was his name said to the man wow thank you for knowing what you want and not taking a long time greatly appreciated in a very sarcastic tone Clearly Casey was referring to us for taking a few minutes to choose a flavor If that bothers him so much he should probably find another place to work because we will not be coming back here,negative,157,150-200,790,500-1000
Donuts may look and taste good but if you are looking for employment here look away The management is horrible  do not pay their staff for the amount of work they do especially the bakers They have also had incidents where they did not pay their staff at all for all the overtime hours they were forced to work Ridiculous working environment And a tip from a fellow past worker get your donuts in the morning or else they will taste old and stale by the end of the day,negative,91,75-100,476,<500
im a fan i stopped here for a quick dessert date with a girlfriend of mine and we both got one drink and one ice cream creation each i decided to create my own using their vanilla base with fruity pebbles mixed in and topped with more fruity pebbles it was soooo good it was dense and creamy  loved that the ice cream didnt start to melt right away too I also tried their Pink Cloud drink and presentationwise it was 55 Unfortunately I didnt try it before my ice cream so I couldnt get the true flavor or taste of the drink  that just means ill need to come back though Would def recommend if youre in the area,positive,122,100-150,630,500-1000
Was so excited for this place Came here on Tuesday April 12th with my 4 year old nephew and my boyfriend before the charlotte knights home opener 635 game we got here at 605pm to a handwritten small note that said be back at 630 Literally nothing elseI had this night planned for over a week with this being on the itinerary He was upset and we were annoyed as there hours state open straight 110pm Being that the game would have started we looked up hours and left planning to return at 845pm before bedtime We leave the game early and show up to the cereal bar at 850 to get some cereal long awaited at this point And it says sold out There is someone working so I knock and he just looked at me and looked awaynot letting me at least explain the situation and frustration For 8 cereal bowls you should certainly stick to your hours of operation and be respectful of peoples time Also if you sell out perhaps get more form the storeI assumed that is where an employee goes on break at 6pm Needless to say VEEY frustrating This was a huge night for charlotte and the downtown area and to close right up to the game time was very frustrating Hard to imagine cereal sold out 630840pm also,negative,226,200-250,1235,1000-1500
We stopped in after my daughters dance recital for a celebratory ice cream The only two flavors available cucumber sorbet and chocolate Really No thanks well take our celebration elsewhere,negative,30,25-50,196,<500
Pretty mediocre food for the price Would expect more than machine made coffee and espresso from a stall that advertises food fit for a king,negative,25,<50,142,<500
I stopped in for the first time today and was very impressed The person at the counter was very helpful and informative as well as patient as I dealt with my very excitedtoeatcookies toddler I tried a filled croissant and I was afraid it might be too cheesy but it was perfect The cookies weve tried so far were great too Cant wait to eat the rest of what I purchased over the next couple of days The girl at the counter also gave us a small loaf of bread for free to welcome us as firsttime customers Well be backsoon,positive,101,100-150,540,500-1000
We were Virgins tonite as this was our first trip to Handels and Trip it was as it was 20 miles one way to get there I say it was worth the trip The Flavors were not only good but plentiful and fun Lin had the chocolate marshmallows which she said lacked marshmallows throughout the scoop She also had coconut cream pie was the better of the two I had the Praline Pecan  Vanilla Oreo which were both good with the Praline the better of these two Our young man that served us lacked a smile and just kind of blew me off when I tried to say something to him Overall it was worth the 2 hours that we spent going to  fro and we met a cute lil lady that was in 3 grade but talked like she was in High School and made the wait in line a delight  I bought her cone cause she was a cutie too Thanks to the internet I found Handels and we will make a return trip,positive,179,150-200,867,500-1000
They had more staff than the number of guests but yet still completely lost and had us waiting This business doesnt even require actual cooking How can this even be possible Please have your staff trained properly and incase of getting your orders wrong or having your guest wait for ling at least have them look at the guests and apologize properly,negative,62,50-75,354,<500
My first visit to Amelies and I am a lifelong hymnsinging devotee I knew I can expect quality goodies from the many reviews I read but to try them in real time was another experience I went in after a late lunch with my sister we saved our dessert space specifically for Amelies Stepping in the insides were soooooo cute just makes you want to stay in for a couple hours  All the desserts looked simply indulgent and it was hard to select just 23 items I love tea cakes but when I couldnt decide between the raspberry and lemon the lovely lady said she would choose raspberryas did I And Im glad I did because it was so light yet rich and flavorful Light because I didnt feel the need for milk with it D I also got a Palmier very crispy and buttery and a cinnamon stick I chose smaller and lighter things because I had a big lunch I will be back to sample everything else and more time on my hands The service was excellent even with a line behind me the person behind the counter patiently waited while I selected Everyone was nice helpful and fast,positive,202,200-250,1083,1000-1500
All I can say is this place is the greatest homemade ice cream spot anywhere Try the Maple Walnut  so good Youll not be disappointed,positive,26,25-50,137,<500
I have been a fan of Cake Boss for quite some time now so when I found out about this location in Las Vegas I was beyond excited After years of wanting to try it out I finally went on my birthday 071118 and I was disappointed The line was long  service was terribly slow I tried the lobster tail and the triple chocolate chip cookies worst Ive ever had I will definitely not go back again,negative,78,75-100,404,<500
Sorry I gave them my money Super rude employees All four were occupied or pretending to be with their backs to the customers and when they did face the customers they did not make eye contact One more second of this crap and I was out of there Once helped we had to repeat our flavor selection several times Although the Ice Cream was delicious the scoops were small and expensive 757 for two small scoops was not worth it Lastly the cashier was a little shady I think he was attempting to scam me out of my change After giving him a 20 for the 757 that I owed him he gave me my receipt and then paused I think he was expecting me to walk away at this point He only gave me my change when I asked for it Beware people beware,negative,145,100-150,756,500-1000
Ive been craving sweets since yesterday  was really looking forward to getting my favorite at Sprinkles The strawberry cupcake But unfortunately when I went in they didnt have anymore So I opted to try something different  got the lemon blueberry It was surprisingly good Would definitely get it again,positive,51,50-75,314,<500
This is really a wonderful place with everything you could hope for in a neighborhood establishment While it is a small site the hearts of the owners and staff are quite large I am especially appreciative of the creative vegan flavors and of how much trouble they go to in order to use local foods Its also nice that even with the smallest selection they will put a couple of flavors together so you can have pretty much everything that interests you They also use biodegradable materials and their tasting spoons are real spoons and not plastic Bravo Helen  Jesse for bringing Masons Creamery to our neighborhood,positive,108,100-150,623,500-1000
Stopped by to try the cereal milk and cookies Maybe it was an off day but the texture of the cereal milk soft serve wasnt smooth but more airy like a mousse The flavor was on point and tasted the same from nyc milk bars though Some of the cookies also tasted dry and stale  Service was good though and staff offered samples,negative,64,50-75,331,<500
Dont bother unless you just want to say you have gone to Carlos Bakery We waited in a long line for about 45 minutes to get in 35 dollars later it was a disappointment We bought the lobster tail which was extremely dry hard and not tasty the cannoli was hard as a rock the chocolate chip cookie was alright nothing special the only thing I enjoyed was the brownie It was moist but nothing special We ate at his restaurant which is right across from the bakery and the dessert was worth it It was delicious and tasty Dont bother with the bakery go straight to the restaurant instead and have dessert there They serve it to you fresh,negative,120,100-150,651,500-1000

Place is too expensive 3 items for 2700 I was surprised I got cookies and a little cheese cake I was excited to try them because it was pretty expensiveBut when I did it was pretty average it didnt blow my mind,negative,42,25-50,224,<500
Friendly service The pretzel cookie was exactly how youd expect it to taste  salty crunchy and pleasant to eat For the service and cookie this place gets a couple stars The triple cinnamon cupcake was anemic and lacking flavor Barely a hint of cinnamon and it would be difficult to even call it cinnamon flavored The cake itself was dry and the frosting tasted of sugar and diabetes For a cinnamon cupcake Id expect more zing,negative,77,75-100,439,<500
Not sure what all the hype was about as I didnt think this place was any good I came here as my brides maids wanted to come and check it out and I ordered the crack pie ice cream and it was okay I didnt want to try the milk flavor or whatever as Im not a big fan of left over milk from my cereal Pretty pricey I probably wouldnt come back or even recommend this place to anyone,negative,80,75-100,386,<500
They only had one soft serve flavor as an option Soft serve was good But with the lack of variety only one of my kids consumed and I was running around looking for an alternative option for my other son,negative,40,25-50,205,<500
good at 2am when you cant drink alcohol but still have the energy for shenanigans not good when you realise price and quality do not match,negative,26,25-50,140,<500
They do not offer carry out orders I did not want any of the soft serve products and they still would not take order over the phone even willing to pay with credit card I was literally in the parking lot but had sleeping kids in car and did not want to leave them in car you themselves Also it takes a few minutes to make the food and it would still be hot to eat so ordering inside was not idea,negative,82,75-100,399,<500
Stopped by to try their famous pastries and grabbed a quick sandwich while on the go Ended up ordering their pork sandwich panini style perfectly pressed on a dutch crunch roll We tried the coffee cake and the cheese danish WOW oh WOW on the pastries The Coffee cake is like no other I have had Buttery and just the right amount of crisp on the top The Cheese danish should have its own twitter pageThat croissant was the lightest buttery creamy cheesy goodness one could ever have Wow I think Im drueling alittleSeriously try their pastriesYou will not regret the  or the calories Its not in the most conspicuous location but walk towards the Phantom area and its right by the escalator,positive,124,100-150,712,500-1000
WOW My Yelp review is mainly about customer service In town on my Honeymoon We stopped at Sprinkles after riding the ferris wheel We grabbed a dozen box and were greeted with some pretty awesome counter girls After we chatted for a few we went to leave and my new bride tripped on her dress and dropped our cupcakes all over the place One of the girls came running out to see if we were OK and then told us to hold tight while she helped us out Literally a few minutes later she came out with a brand new box of cupcakes free of charge and that there was also a special message waiting inside the box When we got back to our room we opened the box and the cupcakes spelled out Tie The Knot IN CUPCAKES Needless to say we were blown away and called the store back right away to rave about our experience They went out of their way when they didnt have to and you dont see that every day anymore Oh yeah and the cupcakes are BOMB 7 down 5 more to go Great frosting super moist cake but best of all SWEET service Thanks so much ladies you really made our day special and it will be a forever memorable moment,positive,219,200-250,1132,1000-1500
Came here again because of my colleagues Of course I decide to order donuts This time I decide to try something different and ask questions Dont ask questions because you will get attitude My colleagues love the fact the girls demeanor changed to rude towards me You sell donuts lady and you have a customer service job Smile and put the donuts in the box and the cashier will ring me up The donuts are good Yes they are because they are donuts The workers there need to humble down The previous donut shop had the customer service and the downtown vibe,negative,102,100-150,566,500-1000
The struggle between keeping your new favorite dessert place a secret and posting a 5star review on Yelp that it deserves I choose the 5star review There have been so many photos of the cookie cup from Fatty Daddys floating around Yelp Instagram  Facebook that I had to go in to try one as soon as possible First and foremost their icecream When we were there we were told that they invent their own flavors and work with a local dairy to bring all their creations to life This is why they have unique flavors like fruit loops cap n crunch blueberry muffin Netflix  chill popcorn flavored infused icecream with a bunch of stuff it etc Next the cookie cup To make one they take up to two icecream flavors of your choice and make a sandwich with a macaron The flavors of the macarons vary but the time we went they had fruity pebbles red velvet and vanilla They also toast up a marshmallow right in front of you and add any toppings to the cup that you may want My order was for a fruity pebbles macaron with blueberry muffin icecream and a toasted marshmallow The best part about this whole dessert was that everything was put together in layers so there were bits of all three parts in every bite The macaron was soft and chewy with a smooth outer shell the blueberry muffin icecream was packed with delicious blueberry flavor and the toasted marshmallow added another unique layer of flavor with a gooey texture Yum Lastly the service was spot on We were welcomed in right when we walked in and offered samples of icecream They were great in making recommendations and were happy to give us the time we needed to make a decision even as it was getting busy I cant wait for the next time to get another cookie cup,positive,319,300- 500,1761,1500-2000
We decided to check out Churn post an outdoor Easter event in the spicy Arizona heat We wanted to try it last night but the line was around the building so we saved it for today We waited in line but only for about 10 min They are requiring a mask and only 2 parties in the building at once Churn is the cutest little ice cream shop it has a retro candy shop vibe and cute decor I was pleased with the variety of flavors they offer along with tasty toppings to add to your ice cream The also offer coffees cookies and make your own ice cream sandwiches Yum My boyfriend and I each got 2 scoops I chose the coconut and the butter pecan to share with my little one and he chose strawberry sorbet and grapefruit sherbet All flavors were delish and I love how their ice cream doesnt taste artificially flavored and overly sugary I also love how reasonably priced they are cheaper than Baskin Robins and 10X tastier Our only disappointment was that there is VERY limited seating and the two tables they do have were full We had to sit in our vehicle and eating ice cream with a toddler in a car is not the most ideal but we made it work Being that they are quite a desired ice cream shop it would be wonderful if they had a few extra tables Otherwise we decided we will be adding Churn to our list of Phoenix faves,positive,255,250-300,1334,1000-1500
I would love to give a higher rating but I cant I never even got close to tasting the pastries When I arrived they were at number 47 My number was 66 I waited 30mns and they moved up to 51 Thats BS I left disappointed And more importantly my kids were disappointed They are big fans of the show and they were looking forward to trying the canolis Very disappointed Hopefully when I actually try the pastries I will give it the higher rating it deserves,negative,87,75-100,465,<500
Overpriced and bland I got the orange custard and the lemon custard both recommended by the cashier They all tasted like regular eggy custard If I closed my eyes I wouldnt be able to tell them apart Its also incredibly overpriced at 2something for a small scoop or dip as they call it The only flavor that seems to be good here is the chocolate Otherwise save your money and your time and just go somewhere else 1 star because its a campus novelty and apparently you havent gone to U of I until youve been to Jarlings,negative,98,75-100,538,500-1000
The ice cream and smoothies are delicious The only reason I rated them so long its because they have really bad customer service The person who helped me out had an attitude the whole time He acted like he was there against his will or something I would not go back because I didnt feel welcomed at all,negative,58,50-75,310,<500
The ice cream was okay it was confusing trying to find the place since now it is just a stand I wasnt too impressed with the flavors since they were so limited Also it was kind of pricy for the little amount that you did get,negative,46,25-50,229,<500

Their cannolis are awesome The store is clean and it is in The Venetian I also appreciate their ordering system They take orders while people are in line so by the time you get to the counter it is ready The staff was friendly and helpful I would gladly go again,positive,51,50-75,268,<500
Handels easily has some of the best ice cream in Vegas Everything is made daily and there is a wide variety of flavors and options when it comes to enjoying everyones favorite cold treat Also great value with 2 Tuesdays Be prepared to stand in line My family and I love this place Were here almost every week However there is no sit in area and the lines can get really long especially during the summer and during normally busy times like Saturday evening Small price to pay for some scrumptious ice cream,positive,93,75-100,521,500-1000
Maybe I dont know what a good cupcake is or maybe I just picked the wrong choice but I wasnt really impressed with my cupcake I really thought they were going to taste a lot better with all the hype but I found it to be rather bland,negative,48,25-50,236,<500
Took my husband who is from Egypt here and then ordered a birthday cake and salted caramel brownies for his birthday I spent 10100 We were going to celebrAte with my family however the floods came and we could not meet So my husband and I celebrated together and when we cut into the cake it was so dry that we could only eat the chocolate mousse and ganache I decided to call this bakery to see what their policy was I was told that they had 2 new bakers and maybe the simple syrup didnt get put on my cake The manager said come by anytime and they would let me choose what I wanted I called 2 weeks later and was told by another manager that they had made me another cake like the first one but I didnt come get it so they cut it and gave it away I told her I was never told this and didnt know She asked me how many people and asked me what I wanted I said 8 and the small cakelike the large one I ordered would be fine and the salted caramel brownies and gluten free ones for my daughter She said fine Ill have it all ready for you I could not believe that I was given 3 small cakes and some kind of small squares and 4 brownies and she said you can cut the small cakes in halfNeedless to say I went to Publix bought a 2400 cake and my husband my family and the waitress loved it,negative,263,250-300,1309,1000-1500
I got the treasure island warm brownie sundae Vanilla ice cream fudge whipped cream cherry and a Ghirardelli chocolate brownie the best part were the ingredients Although its like a 1000 calories its worth it The brownie was probably the best brownie Ive had up till now If you go here or any of their chocolate shops do try their brownie,positive,61,50-75,355,<500
Jenis is great every time The cones are fresh even the cake and sugar ones I think its entirely worth the 5 for a single scoop line or no line We rode the Lynx Blueline down just for ice cream and hopped off the EastWest stop Favorite flavors are coffeecream wildberry lavender and goat cheesecherry If you like sweet and salty at the same time then Jenis is just for you Salty caramel salted peanut and chocolate are always on the menu I cant wait for the next rotation of flavors when they come around I would love to see the pistachio honey again,positive,104,100-150,571,500-1000

MANAGER TERRI SHOULD BE FIRED IMMEDIATELY Sisters visiting from CA and love dessert First thought was Amelies being they have a great selection on French bakery items We waited in like for a good 68 minutes and as soon as I approached the counter to place my order I am screamed at by who I now found out is the MANAGER She began shouting at me infront of other patrons about refusing to serve me because of my mask My mask is clear from working with hearing impaired covers my mouth and nose She told me she wasnt going to serve me because it wasnt one that is provided at their front door Looking at other patrons including my sisters who were not wearing a mask that Amelies provides I was a bit confused I said Im sorry and why is that She then places blame on the OWNERS of Amelies saying he will run the cameras back and if he sees her serving me she will be in trouble Makes ZERO sense again because no one else in the building was wearing a surgical mask I am also a black woman who has a health condition and cannot believe the nature of this interaction The unprofessional attitude and literal screaming at me as if I had been told to put a mask ON and refused was unnecessary and embarrassing I am Manager of a very well known business and would never allow one of my team members to act in such a way She is a disgrace to Amelies and if in fact the owners trained her in this manner they too should resign She allowed me to stand in line with my infant in my arms look at the desserts attempt to order and then began screaming at me with no true explanation besides her fear of the owners watching the cameras I decided not to purchase anything will never recommend or buy from them again and left My sister had a few words with Terri after I left and too couldnt believe the unprofessionalism at hand Terri explained to my sister that the info on mask specifics were posted on their website They indeed are NOT I checked and it still does not excuse her behavior She also told my sister that EIGHT workers at Amelies tested positive for COVID19 Has nothing to do with me I was wearing a mask I called the store after I left and was hung up on by Terri twice because I asked for the owners contact It wont stop there though Terri Good luck on keeping a job And shame on Amelies owners if they allow this to continue Complete discrimination,negative,451,300- 500,2398,2000+
OMG I Love this ice cream but after going there this evening and noticed that none of the employees were wearing masks or using gloves I will not be subject to irresponsible practices We all need to be safe and courtesy of each others health You should also know that it is mandated by the Governor that masks are also required of your customers or they dont get served Whether you believe or not in this virus you do not have any right to disregard health directives So disappointed,negative,89,75-100,491,<500
I had an unfinished draft with a five star but my recent visit to this place was an utter disappointment Let me clarify before start that I had been a loyal customer for the last year and when I heard this place was sold to a new ownership I was wishing that the flavors will be the same Well they were the same they didnt add anything new or took out anything so I was relieved I got the smallest cup as I cant finish bigger ones with the usual macaron and marshmellow topped by myself but the small wasnt the same small That wasnt all My friend got a bigger size and we witnessed the lady I assume shes the new owner taking half a scoop back to the tank after examining how much she had originally scooped I didnt even feel like tipping her because she didnt say a single word until she handed us our orders Im not sure if they decided to keep the old employees because I never returned after but the other employees were actually really friendly I got my ice cream and it was good but I know this is not the only place I can get premium ice creams,negative,207,200-250,1075,1000-1500
I wish I could have tried Sweet Republic as it looked phenomenal when I stopped in Unfortunately after two groups came in after me but were helped before me I decided to leave I had already been there for 15 minutes and did not want to wait any longer when the staff clearly wasnt paying close enough attention to their customers,negative,61,50-75,334,<500
Despite ordering and paying in full over 2 months in advance Carlos did not make our wedding cake for our wedding day as contracted We did not find out until we went to pick it up on the wedding day To make things worse the supervisor had no idea how to use the computer to make things right it took myself The Groom going down there during the reception along with 3 other people to make a scene and push them to just refund us cash and make a new cake on the spot which was obviously extremely thrown together and not what we ordered This caused a big delay in our party while all our guests waited for me to get back to the reception Their excuse was that some hand off did not happen internally I understand things happen but you do not just forget to make a wedding cake Though the cash was refunded and we did end up with some kind of cake it doesnt make up for the guests missing out on the cake I specifically ordered and myself missing 45 minutes of my own reception Do not use Carlos catering for any event if you want your dessert as contracted,negative,206,200-250,1070,1000-1500
Worst cheesecake Ive ever had in my life texture was horrible and tasted even worse,negative,15,<50,86,<500
Cute little place great help but the product was lacking We got two cupcakes and a macaron The cupcakes looked delightful but tasted awful The banana cupcake was dry and icing was hard probably a day olde The chocolate piece on top was filled with a banana candy so hard I had to spit it out The Samoa cupcake was also dry and the chocolate on top was filled with a cream that was so gross it was also spit out Finally the macaron was larger than most It was hard and the cream inside was chunky and gross Overall they need to decrease the menu and focus on making a few great items instead of a lot of items that are not very good,negative,125,100-150,644,500-1000
BEST RED VELVET CUPCAKE I went to all the cupcake bake shop in Las Vegas and this bake shop has the best red velvet My mom will be ordering her wedding cake here soon The only thing I didnt like was one of the employee is really rude This was my first time coming here so ordering I didnt how they do it I was only going to ask her a question but held up her hand to my face She didnt even let me finish If I come back to this shop I hope she will not be there to do this to me again,positive,106,100-150,495,<500

Love Handels Its so much better than the chain ice cream brands that Vegas still seems to live by Its just an outside counter similar to Luv Its but with 5x the flavors and its ice cream not custard which I personally like better on most nights The number of flavors is both a blessing and a curse they will not be happy if you hold up the line because of indecision Figure out what you want before you hop in if you can I recommend the Graham Central Station Delicious,positive,91,75-100,484,<500

The baked goods are sweet but the customer service is sour I came here with my family tonight to pick up a few things We had been waiting in line for approximately 5 minutes when one of the employees questioned whether or not we had masks We did not have masks because we thought the Mecklenburg County mandate ended today The employee told us It ends tomorrow so I cant let it fly tonight Mind you it is 815PM and tomorrow is literally 3 hours and 45 minutes from now How ridiculous 1 Any place with good customer service would have complimentary masks to offer to people if they are going to actually force patrons to wear them nowhere else in Charlotte enforces this except for healthcare facilities btw We would have put masks on to be respectful of their rule even if it is idiotic if they had offered them to us 2The employee could have offered to take our order at the walk up window outside as a compromise but didnt even bother to offer that as a solution because he was too busy being the smug mask cop We have been frequent customers here over the last year but I dont think well be back again Spending my hard earned money at a place where the employees lack the critical thinking and interpersonal skills to diplomatically resolve what THEY perceive to be a problem doesnt sit right with me,negative,242,200-250,1343,1000-1500
FROZEN baked goods The lady in front of me asked for something that was out of stock in the display so the counter person said they could go check in the freezer for morecome on This is supposed to be one of the better bakeries in charlotte and they are serving frozen baked goods That is a big no no Ive been here a couple of times now and this time I came on a Tuesday around 12pm I had to wait almost 30 minutes to get a turkey sandwich I have never been extremely impressed by Amelies Seems like it is a bunch of bells and whistles,negative,108,100-150,553,500-1000
Churn has so many interesting flavors Many of the flavors do change Fun to stop by and sample a few of the new flavors before you choose the one for you that day Stopped in the other evening and the gals behind the counter were great Really enjoyed the ice cream treat,positive,52,50-75,273,<500
this was the 3rd chance i gave milk and honestly i give up everything sucks from cookies shakes cake soft serve cookies and cakes are always dry shakes are meh we tried the chocolate one and nothing home to write home about and extremely expensive for what starbucks considers a tall and what a joke to even offer the short size and soft serves always taste like theyre half salt half air the soft serves are so airy borderline whipped cream tasting more than they are ice cream its not the service i have issues with its the food,negative,99,75-100,557,500-1000
Very disappointed with my last visit to this bakery which is really sad given I live nearby I ordered the coq au vin soup which i was told was a hearty chicken soup the croissant sandwich with ham and cheese as well as a fruit tart The cup of soup had absolutely no pieces of chicken in it just a lot of broth and onions The croissant was a mess one side was not the entire croissant seems most of it felt out or got burned so removed The only thing that was good was the fruit tart as always As I ordered all togo I didnt noticed all this until I got home which was extremely irritating And this is not a cheap place,negative,125,100-150,631,500-1000
This is a summer in Cleveland staple Their homemade ice creams are fantastic I especially like the honey pecan My dog also enjoys a kiddie dish with a plain scoop of vanilla  I frequent one of Honey Huts locations several times a month Its a nice cool treat every time,positive,51,50-75,280,<500
Very disappointing we went in for a cookie but ended up getting cupcakes too The cupcakes arent that great for over 30 for 4 cupcakes and a couple cookies we expected something delicious but instead wound up with dried out crunchy stale cookies and the cupcakes we thought since they were small like kiddie party size they were going to be good but not at all impressed They tasted OK but they werent fresh either The whole experience was a disappointment We didnt even finish eating them,negative,87,75-100,499,<500
The cereal lattes were super overly sweet didnt have the greatest experience The service was cool but damn that latte was not good at all,negative,25,<50,140,<500
great local ice cream shop Try any of the snowstorms and you will love it My favorite is cheesecake snowstorm or the Heat bar snowstorm Yummy,positive,26,25-50,144,<500
Donuts are probable awesome but i have never been able to try them I have been in here a few times and they never have donuts They are always sold out So just be aware that there is a relatively good chance that this donut shop will not have donuts I am sure when they have them they are good Fool me once shame on you fool me twice shame on me Fool me a third time now i am just a moron who is not coming back But what do i know i am just guy that wants my donut shop to have donuts,negative,105,100-150,494,<500
Really good ice cream Definitely a popular spot which means it must be good has a great selection  I love that they make all their own stuff The employees were nice as well,positive,34,25-50,179,<500
This place had tasty ice cream milkshakes and among other items I tried the strawberry shortcake cheesecake milkshake and was impressed The milkshake wasnt overprices they had variety and the ability to customize I would recommend Ninetys Ice Cream to anyone looking for a good place with sweet treats,positive,49,25-50,309,<500
Hi There Need to clarify 2 things There is a Stand up  Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian casino level And The Cafe Bouchon on the 10th floor of the Palazzo seemed great place to have a breakfast business meeting being  Neutral as I call it A nice view of the outside patio See but dont touch  It was a GREAT morning Patio was closedOKAYY While I was waiting for my client I ordered the tray of assorted pastry Looked tempting But thought rude to start nibbling  My client arrived after the usual greetings we were both famished A very friendly waitress brought us coffee perused though the breakfast menu and decided I was in the mood for Classic Bacon eggs breakfast My client decided on the same Coffee was good We both tasted the Whatever pastry it was supposed to be TALKING ABOUT LOOKS BEING DECEIVING YUCK it tasted like a rubber toy  Okay Maybe it was a mistake Lets go on to the next pastry on the well served eye appealing tray we cut in half the almond something UHMM Other than a few decorative almonds on top of the PASTRY There was no hint of Chantilly cream no almond  Okay Lets move it along The pain Au chocolate I suppose it was to be a classic chocolate croissant Was Empty and dry Our eggs arrived A bit runny to say the least Hey but the coffee was good We ate the toast and drank 3 cups of coffee  BTW 2 eggs and a sliver of bacon 4  2200 each I wonder where the chickens came from The eggs werent certainly golden  The tray of pastry 4 PCs were not for human consumption BUT THEY LOOKED GREAT If you want a breakfast that looks good And your not Hungry This is the place to go   CIAOO,negative,318,300- 500,1717,1500-2000
I came to Vegas for a conference and a colleague kept telling me you have to go next door to the Cosmo for the Milk Cereal Soft Serve The last night there I finally said ok lets try it Best decision ever I had the fruity pebbles milk cereal the concept is they make the soft serve base out of what would be your left over Cereal milk It was delicious and the best part was it had a little bit of a saltiness,positive,84,75-100,416,<500
They are ok Personally I have had much better desserts brownies macroons turnovers and others from other bakeries that taste much better and sometimes are even cheaper You are paying for the name not quality of the product,negative,38,25-50,230,<500
Came here at the Las Vegas store expecting to have the same great pastry after visited multiple stores in San Francisco When I finally came home and opened it upon peeling off the baking paper at bottom of the taro bread I immediately saw the long hair sitting at the bottom Disgusting and felt sick to the stomach after seeing that This shows how bad the baking environment is behind the scene and who knows what else is going on back there Also whenever employees yell fresh bread and took out the trays please do not speak out while your mouth is on top of the pastry bad hygiene standard by all means at least wear a mask as if youre baking from the inside,negative,125,100-150,676,500-1000
I wanted chocolate cake with chocolate buttercream icing and I found this bakery on line and I was just so amazed that this small bakery is the best I have ever eaten at I wish that I could get anything close to that in Roanoke Virginia but there is nothing that comes even close to such a pure fresh feeling of the joy from eating excellent food from professionals,positive,69,50-75,367,<500
Tasted everything and was not impressed It was not like the items were bad just not worth the extra cost or wait Reminded me of sweetsdesserts you would get at a friends house after they rant and rave about them only to find they are only as good as store bought cookies and pies Maybe New York store is better Birthday truffles were the best but nothing THAT great,negative,69,50-75,373,<500
If youre not yet deeply acquainted with the Milk Bar birthday cake that should be your next priority Best Cake Ever And the slice from their Vegas outpost didnt disappoint Chocolate was also delicious Cereal milk soft serve is great but the cake is where its at Cookies are also amazing but sticking with my cake for now Service was friendly enough Busy Crowded But fine All totally worth it,positive,70,50-75,410,<500
First of all they shouldnt have kids working there second the lines are so longi know buddy wouldnt like the quality of the pastries his workers are putting out the pastries look like crap and way over pricedplz fix the lobster tail,negative,42,25-50,237,<500
This places is really hard to find The cannoli was just okay But the vanilla bean blender was really good Do think it over priced for a cannoli smoothie and a smalL coffee 1940  Guess you paying for the name,negative,41,25-50,216,<500
The ice cream is amazing but the customer service is awful They have no idea how to move a line quickly You wind up waiting a ridiculous amount of time compared to the other Handels and other ice cream stores around You could milk a cow and make your own ice cream in the time you wait for your turn to be helped This is the best ice cream in Vegas but until the Vegas franchisee figures it out the wait will always be abominably long,negative,86,75-100,440,<500
Place is amazing Cant say enough about how great the bread is The almond croissant is a fast sellout so get there early,positive,23,<50,123,<500
Was craving a Ghirardelli brownie so I went in specifically for the Lands End Placed my order and waited a bit only to be handed something that was NOT the Lands End When I said it wasnt what I ordered they replied with Oh ya Were out of brownies Weve been out for like a week They did offer to make me something else but when I said I came in for a brownie all 4 employees just kind of stared at me and then kept working Tasted fine but pretty disappointed to have spent 15 for something I didnt really want,negative,102,100-150,529,500-1000
This place is hard to find Anyway I was in the mood for some macaroons My partner in crime is dessert fanatic so was game when I mentioned this place Boy were we disappointed He had a chocolate pie and I had 3 macaroon Visually the macaroons looked appealing and the size was generous compared to other offering on the strip Taste was too sweet a lemon macaroon is not supposed to be sweet The chocolate pie was just like eating a chocolate bar And the prices were outrageous 2 espresso drinks  1 dessert and 3 macaroons for total of 26 I think there are better offering on the strip so look elsewhere,negative,114,100-150,616,500-1000
Managed to take a pretty idiot proof idea and make everything taste like sour milk Pass,negative,16,<50,89,<500
Meh Not impressed Got an ice cream flight 5 flavors Creamy Yes but flirting with ice milk texture Flavors are ok  not intense Its as if they took the same vanilla base  then added stuff to it The giveaway to my hunch The Salty Caramel Salty Yes Caramel Not really true caramel The color of the ice cream was vanilla white I dont believe its possible to make any kind of caramel without some sort of brownish hue Im a trained and working pastry chef  so guys get back in the kitchen and fine tune You have a fun store concept and it seems all the hipsters dig it But without substance Im afraid your devotees will move on to the next trend,negative,126,100-150,668,500-1000
There was no line and it STILL took over 30 minutes to get one smoothie My friend got a hot fudge Sunday and their world famous hot fudge wasnt even warm The employees moved at a snails pace I paid 10 for a berry smoothie Its obvious the employees dont care they dont have any regard for being efficient DONT GO HERE,negative,62,50-75,331,<500
First time here Great service Order came through quickly Clean The front desk guy explained the ordering system very clearly It was really hot so I didnt get the waffle fish just Ebi ice cream swirl in a cup The gal preparing my order asked if I wanted toppings which is included in the price I chose the toasted coconut and a fresh strawberry Loved the cold creaminess and the coconut and strawberry provided a nice contrast,positive,77,75-100,436,<500
First things first the graphic body parts decor was very unsettling and immediately disturbed my stomach but I pushed through and got their ice cream which was wayyy over priced8 It was good the first 3 bites but nothing too special The environment is very artsy and unique but not the best idea for an ice cream drink and food spot I was getting more thriftantique store vibes lol,negative,69,50-75,394,<500
Just the very best homemade ice cream Cute store with nostalgic candies and treats Staff is always friendly,positive,18,<50,110,<500
Shortly after landing in Vegas Friday morning I rushed over to the Venetian for a mid morning snack and cappuccino from Bouchon Bakery The bakery was tricky to find but it was worth every step I took to get there The walkup bakery has a great display of Frenchinfluenced baked goods I was lucky to beat the midmorning rush Shortly after ordering the barista commented on how perfectly dry the cappuccino was She handed me my drink and a precisely baked pain au chocolate that had a golden brown and flaky exterior that was filled with warm rich chocolate Not that I needed to but I couldnt resist ordering something for the road I chose a soft and chewy buttercream filled lemon macaron that turned out to be a delicious way to finish my snack Bouchon Bakery was a great way to start my Vegas weekend I had perfect timing beating the rush they had perfect service a perfect cappuccino and perfect baked goods In no time after finishing my first few bites a dozen or so people came charging in to experience the expertly crafted and enticing display of Bouchons baked goods,positive,193,150-200,1097,1000-1500
We waited in line for almost 30 minutes There is a window to watch the bakers in the back That kitchen was filthy You pick what you want at the counter Nothing has descriptions or prices on it We ended up getting a mini 10 cheesecake a 7 carrot cake cupcake and other ridiculously priced items The carrot cake was dry and bland The cheesecake was ok but not with 10 The lobster tail was hard and crunchy I would never come back Its only popular because of the Tv show but their baked goods are not worth it,negative,99,75-100,524,500-1000
 Best ice cream ever  No lie  I thought this place was all hype but after coming here Im literally hooked and obsessed,positive,25,<50,128,<500
I am not at all a fan of the Cake Boss Ive never seen the show However my cousin is and is the reason for my recent visit to Carloss Bakery When we got there the line wasnt as long as I expected from pictures that Ive seen which I was pleased with It was about a 25 minute wait to even get inside the bakery When we finally got inside and waited for someone available to take our order the man didnt even look at me or ask if I had been helped before he greeted the lady behind me I quickly said hello to him to get his attention only then did he realize he skipped over me My cousin and I had been standing for a while looking so we already had our order ready I watched the man write down my order correctly and stepped aside to wait to be called He called me over to check if my order was write It was missing two things I dont understand how you forget two things when you wrote it down and the case is literally two inches in front of your face not to mention it wasnt a very big order So Im finally called up to pay and the women repeats my order back to me before charging me and everything she repeated was correct It wasnt until I got home that I noticed she charged me for a large chocolate cannoli and not a large chocolate chip cookie even though she repeated back cookie The cannoli does cost more than the cookie so I was very upset with that No one in this place has any sense of urgency Everyone just kind of shuffles around slowly as if they didnt have a crowd outside of the door When we sat down to eat our desserts I was desperately hoping they would at least be good enough to make all this worth it But of course they werent All the desserts tasted like any other bakery They werent bad but werent anything special either If I wanted average food I would go to a regular bakery The lobster tail was good Ill give them that But thats about the only good thing I have to say about it All in all I would have to say I would never recommend this place to anyone The workers are incompetent the food is average and very over priced and the wait time is ridiculous,negative,417,300- 500,2132,2000+
Years you guys My visit to the Milk Bar has been at least 4 YEARS in the making when I first heard about the amazing Crack Pie and Cereal Milk ice cream I dont even remember where I heard about it but its been in the back of my mind since then I even made a copycat Crack Pie recipe that won a pie contest and was AMAZING So I just HAD to try the real thing Ugh it was disappointing I mean the crack pie was okay but Id rather just have like a 1 candy bar or something The cereal milk ice cream was interesting at first bite but after that I just didnt want to eat it anymore and thats not like me to stop eating ice cream I couldnt finish it My husband couldnt either I think he was annoyed that Id hyped this place up so much Sorry hon But now I know I can make a copycat crack pie thats better than the original,negative,170,150-200,840,500-1000
Unfortunately I cannot recommend this place Granted we stopped by at 9pm on a Saturday but they are open till 10 so figured we give them a try My first observation is that in a fridge full of great looking cakes none of them were covered What I mean is when you start cutting slices from a refrigerated cake you MUST cover the exposed inside of the cake with some type of food grade paper or cover to keep it from drying Out of about 67 cakes none of them were covered I thought these could not possibly be fresh and likely dry and tasting like a fridge So decided to skip those My wife opted for some sort of pastry that had a light cream filling in another cooler cabinet Wow I wish we would have taken a bite while at the place because when we did later in the car we almost lost a couple of teeth I mean this thing was hard like a brick tasted like freezer burn and was insipid Horrible Look I get it that on a Saturday at 9pm I dont expect necessarily for things to have been made the hour before but I have eaten at late night bakeries such as Amelies and I have never had to throw away something because it was not fresh At VIllanis they clearly do not care what they are serving late at night I get that maybe a few pastries would sneak in between the fresh batches but the fact that the cut cakes were completely exposed to the fridge air was proof enough that they simply are not trained in food freshness efforts Tip to them Cover your cakes toss old pastries and offer better If the goal is to serve the drunk crowd from plaza midwood then that may be good enough but not for anyone else,negative,314,300- 500,1637,1500-2000
What a Treat The ice cream  the employees especially JUSTIN  he was soo nice  friendly  informativeHe went out of his way to help us  the ice cream  anyone you get  is DELICIOUS we shall be back,positive,43,25-50,209,<500
Why dont you update Yelp and food delivery services that your Linq location is closed Delivery drivers are still being sent to Sprinkles at the Linq only to find it is closed,negative,32,25-50,178,<500
Honestly the first time I tried milk bar in DC it was awful The cereal ice cream is so bland and underwhelmingIm still not sure what the hype is about for this place I decided to give milk bar another try when I saw it at the cosmopolitan in Vegas This time I went for the birthday quake A quake is apparently like a blizzard It was better than the cereal soft serve but still had the same salty and bitter tasteits just not what I would imagine for ice cream Doesnt satisfy the craving The birthday truffles on the other hand are actually pretty delicious Theyre overpriced for what they are but probably the best dessert choice at milk bar,negative,121,100-150,661,500-1000
I loved this ice cream just the smell of this place is fantastic reasonable prices too,positive,16,<50,91,<500
I love the atmosphere here Its so cozy and timeless The cakes are always new and an inventive blend of flavors I would definitely recommend coming here to sit down have a coffee and some cake and relax,positive,38,25-50,208,<500
Delicious ice cream flavors cute shop Came in around 6 pm earlier today with my two cousins tried a few samples then a big group of people came in so we kinda felt a little pressured to hurry since there was only one employee working at the time I hate how small it is inside wish it was bigger other than that the employee was super sweet and very nice good pricing as well,positive,74,50-75,383,<500
Fun space in a very charming part of Ohio City Its mature tree lined on a one way street There is parking off street or on the south side of the building Mind you we went on a Saturday night The line was massive After waiting 40 minutes I was super excited for my choice And wouldnt you know it the person in front of me got the last of it Me and my big trap shouldnt have told my BF why I was so excited to try it grrr So the lady was super nice about having me try samples but was deflated and no longer excited The ice cream we got was very good Portions are the kind that make you wish you would have ordered two Not sure if I will ever wait that long again But would like to give it another shot,positive,147,100-150,722,500-1000
The best bakery Open 247 Amazing food Always long lines but so worth the wait We have been about 5 times and other than the occasional rude employee which is rare we have had exceptional service and never regretted our food choices They make their own lavender lemonade that is really refreshing One tip There is a ton of seating in the very back if you walk down the hall past the coffee bar My favorites include the salted caramel torte macaroons if they are fresh and bacon and cheese on a croissant,positive,93,75-100,516,500-1000
I have been waiting to go here and I finally got the chance to go tonight And oh my it was an amazing decision My fiancÃ got a macaroon ice cream sandwich They only had a couple flavors available but she got a birthday cake macaroon The ice cream had chunks of cake in it I got the doughnut sandwich I cant member the exact name but it was amazing They have a menu you can chose from but you can also create your own I ordered a cookie dough ice cream with strawberry syrup and strawberry short cake crumbs They make it right in front of you and then warm up the doughnut It was very good Will definitely be going back to this place many to try their many creations,positive,132,100-150,679,500-1000
I walked in with all three of my children as usual mask required sticker marker on the floor for social distancing The people who work their are super friendly Vegan donuts bomb AF They have vegan options for iced coffee too Sit down dining is outside only They have chocolate milk for the kids I forgot to take pictures but we liked the vegan strawberry one the most,positive,68,50-75,373,<500
Overrated Ordered a crack pie and cereal milk soft serve The chick didnt know how to make it I got a melted blob of a mess in one of their milkshake cups The spoons at the place are short wooden sticks so it was hard to eat The cereal milk tasted weird some bites were salty and it wasnt sweet thought it would be since its ice cream The crack pie flavor was okay at least it was sweet and not salty Not good enough to finish Ended up throwing away 14 in the trash,negative,95,75-100,482,<500
This was disappointing I went out of my way to go here for an amazing sundae on my birthday I asked the cashier if there were any special birthday things they could do and he just said NO No happy birthday no Ill check It wasnt very nice The 10 sundae was fine Meh I wont go back,negative,58,50-75,292,<500
Why oh why didnt I look at Yelp before coming here Perhaps because the smell off freshly made crepes was enticing We stood on a fairly long line with a gal bun in hair ring through nose and a nasty attitude Not may I help the next person but what do you want and move down Doughy tasteless crepe with green bananas You cant mess up nutella so that saved it She put the topping two inches away from edge so you just had one mouthful of dough after the other No and No save yourself the trouble and go get something tasty from a bakery,negative,106,100-150,550,500-1000
Wanted to try this place out from the great reviews I had heard from friends Long lines no where to sit overpriced pastries and service wasnt that great,negative,28,25-50,159,<500

As far as ice cream goes this place is pretty average The flavors dont have a lot of mixins like you might find in a pint of Ben  Jerrys Not many toppings either Three stars for just being average with one more star knocked off for their mask policy Enforcing a mask policy at an ice cream parlor is in my opinion laughable,negative,64,50-75,336,<500

Ordered a pint the soft serve lacks flavor the toppings taste stale For 18 they were too cheap to give us the clean milk bar container like the one on the menu we got the unbranded paper cup instead Totally not worth it not even IG worthy,negative,47,25-50,246,<500
I know I am going to get flack about this but I think Amelies is over rated The pastry is small and over priced I think this is an example of growth diluting quality When I first went I was impressed Good quality kitschy decor embodiment of NODA Now its just average I know that it is difficult to find a good bakery in Charlotte but they have become  just another place Im just saying,negative,76,75-100,405,<500
I was excited to try the place Ive been to Bouchon restaurant and it was a good experience I was hoping that the bakery was as good We got some macaroons and a croissant I expected better especially for the price The macaroon fillings were too sweet The croissant was cold and not flaky It was just a bit better than the ones you get from Costco Therefore it wasnt worth the price You can almost get a whole box of croissants at Costco for one croissant here,negative,88,75-100,473,<500
Went there at 750am before they opened There was a line Not impressed with it at all Decided to try it for a second time the next day Got there at 815am didnt walk out till 9am Same disappointment in the goods not good Not recommending unless you have lots of time to kill for average baked goods Way over rated It must be their marketing tactic to create a line outside because they work slow compared to norm No sense of urgency or efficiency They ate slow They write down your order instead of pulling it out from the case as you tell them then they have you wait while they grab your order n box it Then you go up to this really sweet cashier lady who is at the same or slower pace N when you are ready to eat your 40 min wait goods theres nothing wowing to it Super average,negative,155,150-200,801,500-1000
The best ice cream I have ever had I know have a reason to move to PhoenixScottsdale and the reason is Sweet Republic The menu is like a all star list of ice cream and it took me a while to make a decision of what to try beyond the obvious everything I went for a classic with the Madagascar Vanilla and a unique flavor with the Honey Blue Cheese to try to get an idea of Sweet Republics range WOW they blew me away The honey blue cheese was an oddly wonderful taste that I enjoy in its normal incarnation but found the ice cream version to be somehow better The flavors were well developed and not over powering especially the blue cheese which could have been a bully and ruined everything A subtly savory sweet treat The Madagascar vanilla was nothing short of perfect the flavor was dead on texture was perfect and best of all the silky creaminess worked together to develop my first official ice cream addiction needing intervention The iconic ice cream flavor has a new high mark set with this one I will without hesitation go out of my way to stop in at Sweet Republic anytime I am in the state of Arizona My only request dream is that they have a tasting menu I would gladly hand over 1020 for a well rounded spoonful of each flavor available Out of this world Sweet Republic thank you for delivering the best culinary experience during my stay in Arizona,positive,255,250-300,1388,1000-1500
Ive been wanting to try this place for so long since I missed out last time I was in New York But I was very disappointed maybe its just how I tasted it but it was not appealing to me at all Located right next to Momofuku they have a lot of different things on their menu board So much that I could not see where the soft serve flavors were There was too much going on We were able to try some samples and Im glad we did The cereal milk flavor was very surprising to me It tasted like soggy cereal milk without tasting the cereal bits The first taste is also a bit salty I was really taken aback with this taste and disappointed because I thought it would taste really good We also tried their crack pie flavor which is a brown sugar custard That was slightly better but I just expected a bit more taste and more flavors Sad to say I wont be coming back but it was worth a try Definitely get some samples before you purchase though,negative,185,150-200,955,500-1000
This is my first time to visit this Bakeshop bcoz one of my girlfriends raved about this place Well as a family who is always on the lookout for  good pastries this place is very disappointing First its overpriced  its Vegas duh  We ordered the cannoli taste is bland nothing special  the cream even tasted  grainy We also ordered 3 different flavored croissants  I really think we were ripped off We left it overnight for the next morning  the croissants became really hard to eat Lastly we also bought the apple crumble pie  tasted like we bought it from Vons Ralphs  We Wont come back not worth the money at all But the staff is really nice thats for the star I gave,negative,132,100-150,705,500-1000
Great selection of baked goods I enjoy their Pain au Chocolate and their Gruyere Croissant Touchless payment available,positive,18,<50,122,<500
YeahIm going to have to agree with everyone that this place is all hypeonly good thing was that I didnt have to wait in linethe first time I tried it was more than an hour wait so I left,negative,39,25-50,197,<500
The ice cream here was fantastic and the staff was energetic and friendly I tried the pretzel cone which I was a little bit disappointed by because it tasted kind of stale and was REALLY salty All in all I loved the food and the old fashioned candy shop vibe that the store has Parking is very limited but we came late enough in the evening that it wasnt a problem for us,positive,73,50-75,379,<500
After some sampling of a few flavors of ice cream I decided to go with the raspberry cheesecake ice cream with a waffle cone and surprisingly I didnt enjoy the ice cream at all It wasnt anything special and my ice cream melted very quickly Im an ice cream lover and I was not a fan of this location at all,negative,61,50-75,315,<500
Very overpriced honestly have had better shakes at Burger King Nothing special about this place at all I got a slice milk bar pie I thought it would come with ice cream and it didnt it was like paying 650 for a cookie A milkshake there runs ya 10 totally not worth it,negative,53,50-75,276,<500
This place is an absolute joke In the matter of 3 minutes they lost 8 customers due to the embarrassing amount of donuts or lack there of in the cases Why do you stay open all day when you have 3 donuts to offer customers Im no business person but it doesnt take much intelligence to know that youre actually wasting money trying to pawn off the few stale donuts left from the morning while you are paying employees I will never return Yuck,negative,84,75-100,452,<500
Tried their macarons wasnt impressed and given the number of raving reviews here Id say I was disappointed,negative,18,<50,112,<500
Welcome to Las Vegas 85C Located in Shanghai Plaza Spring mountain and Wynn Rd Came in here two days ago and its extremely busy We stood in line for almost 25 minutes to get in and waited more at the check out This location is a bit smaller than the ones I always went to SD I love how they have a kiosk to order your cakes and drinks to avoid the line Breads and Pastries were always great at affordable prices ranges 23 My favorites Cheese bread Choco bun Taro marble bun and milk tea bun Egg tarts are sooo good a must try They continually restocked fresh pastries and you will probably hear them yelling fresh bread literally every few minutes Fresh bread all day long Cashier named Nancy was super nice Ill come back here more often for my bread fix without long hours of drive,positive,149,100-150,814,500-1000
Am I alone in the world here Amelies is a beautiful whimsical place great for doing work or people watching But the pastries are a flat C Ive been here four times since Ive moved to Charlotte and not once have I had anything that could even be described as good Not the eclairs saltwater caramel brownies macaroons chocolate mousse almond cakesnothing Im sure there are way tastier and less expensive offerings around the QC Dont get me wrongits really pretty in there Like a girls daydream after watching Amelie and the only reason Im giving 2 stars instead of 1 12 The treats and I loooove treats just arent that great,negative,112,100-150,657,500-1000
What can I say that hasnt already been written about Amelies If you appreciate the occasional sweet treat this place has the best in Charlotte I am a fan of macaroons and theirs are simply delish The macaroons I have tried here include pistachio lemon salted caramel passionfruit and coconut I particularly enjoyed the coconut and the lemon Another favorite treat here is the salted caramel brownie  it has the perfect balance of sweet and just a hint of salt in the creamy caramel There are so many goodies behind the counter that I have not tried yet and I am always looking forward to my next visit The hard part is choosing between the Ãclairs napoleons tarts and all of the other yummylooking pastries Thank goodness they arent close to my work or home or Id be having to put in a lot of extra gym time to work off all those extra calories,positive,156,150-200,871,500-1000
Stopped in here for some sweets while walking back to our hotel Got a small box of milk and dark chocolate strawberries mixed with milk dark and white chocolate cherries Outstanding especially the strawberries,positive,34,25-50,214,<500
I heard many reviews on this place Not much of a pastry person especially for breakfast so didnt try that I came across this right after I won a few bucks on a slot machine and thought I deserved a treat I grabbed a carmel macaroon OMG Was perfect Ive never had a macaroon before but so glad I did Dont know what Ill do now since I wont be able to get my fix at home I should had bought a dozen,positive,83,75-100,419,<500
Finally got a chance to try 85C Bakery however it was not as good as the hype I tried two items Taro bun was too sweet coffee flavor bread was very average Havent tried the pork bun I got yet but it looks oily To me their items are not high quality My friend did not like the milk tea she ordered because it was way too sweet and didnt taste fresh Disappointed overall Service was friendly,negative,77,75-100,403,<500
We have been coming here for years and always enjoy the delicious ice cream amazing cookies and nostalgic gift shop Tonight changed everything for us We brought our two small children with us and the employee was a male dressed in complete dragfake eyelashes heavy makeup etc For a familyfriendly environment children should NOT be exposed to this We will not be back How disappointing Upward Projects,negative,67,50-75,414,<500

I could not have been more disappointed My friend and I were SO excited to have the famous Sprinkles cupcakes while on vacation in Vegas this week We each ordered 2 different flavors and couldnt wait to dig inwhat a waste of money All of them were the same qualitywe both said they tasted like weekold stale cupcakes that wouldnt have been good when they were fresh The frosting was too rich which for me to say is something and the cake in each one was dense crumbly just unpleasant We are both huge fans of desserts especially cake and cupcakes and both of us ate only about a third of each of the cupcakes before we sadly threw them away We both agreed that we have had MUCH better cupcakes from our local grocery store They are obviously just riding on their fame and know they dont care if they have return customers So disappointed,negative,156,150-200,862,500-1000
All I can say is AMAZING AMAZING AMAZING The best doughnut ice cream sandwich in Phoenix My partner  I love to try new foods sweets are on top of our list ,positive,33,25-50,160,<500
I loooooooooove ice cream its my weakness and the most important on my cheat days I had somi in Cali a few years back when it first started so I was thrilled when it made its way here The ice cream is so creamy and the fishy has the best crispy gooey texture to it Its probably more dangerous for me because I live down the street eek The plus side is this location is a little slower than China town so I dont have to turn myself away from long lines,positive,92,75-100,462,<500

Cue the music Sugarohh Buddy Buddy You are a candyman and you got me forgetting youuuu Ill keep it short and sweet unlike the lines and the pastries for sale here Bland Overhyped Not worth the wait Or the money Or the calories A handful of mediocre cookies and pastries 1500 Two important life lessons taken away from this horrible place priceless Lesson 1 If youre ever feeling down just remember that as long as you have a personality everything else will be just fine Lesson 2 Money really does buy nice things including but not limited to one hell of a Marketing Director,negative,104,100-150,609,500-1000

The lemon blackberry ice cream was excellent Good staff good service good stuff We be back to Oberweis again You should check it out,positive,24,<50,137,<500
Their ice cream is so delicious We went to celebrate my daughters birthday and got a huge banana split for all 4 of us It was incredible They even put a candle in it for her so we could sing Highly recommend The shop itself is in a little strip mall that is not the greatest but once you step in it is defiantly an old fashion style Very cute,positive,70,50-75,352,<500
While the lobster tails were very good cannolis not so much Rugelach was goodbut OMG pricy Like 23 or 24 dollars a pound Here is my big complaint I spent about 2400 but then I was charged over 200 tax I was POed I promptly phoned Carlos and the gal who answered told me they charge tax on everything I asked who the manager was and I was told TINA I left my name and number and asked if Tina would return my call This was 6 weeks ago and I am still waiting Well I am so angry I had phoned the franchise tax board who confirmed that I should not have been charged sales tax Here is this tremendous business who is overcharging customers over 8 on every single purchase The only item they could charge tax on is a beverage or a pastry eaten at their counter Another example of the tax scam is go to Sprinkles at the Linqs If I order 4 cupcakes no tax For all the people who say they watched Buddy on Foodnetwork they dont know what they are talking about His show was on TLC,negative,194,150-200,1000,500-1000
nom we just checked in and first thing we got was  macarons at bouchon bakery  yes they are expensive at 350 a piece but they are also 2x the size of your regular macarons these are palm sized  its as if two macarons merged and formed voltronmacaron got pistachio and coffee  both have great chewy shell tepid to the touch so not hard and frigid and delicious lightly sweetened fillings  i think i may favor these over lettes will have to grab more on our way out edit  got more we had 2 butter crossiants the vanilla macaron and chocolate macaron SO DELICIOUS that we made an extra trip back for this  Favorite macaron was the VANILLA,positive,124,100-150,681,500-1000
This place has changed and the portions are much much smaller Instead of getting a a top and bottom to the macaroon cookie in the cookie cups you get one on top of the very very small single scoop of ice cream with a toasted marshmallow This is completely not worth 695 Also the single scoop is the smallest single scoop I have ever gotten I would recommend Melt over this place any day,negative,74,50-75,394,<500
Let me begin by saying that a year ago I wouldve given Amelies 5 stars I think the problem is that Amelies is pretty much the only one of its kind in Charlotte and its now too crowded and understaffed or staffed with people who dont care Every time I go there is a huge line dirty plates on every table and a mass of people My favorite bakery items are the twice baked chocolate croissants The last few times Ive been they were either out of them that happened twice or they said they had them and then gave me the twice baked almond croissant by mistake realized that when I got home or they had them so I was so excited that I got two  they were both stale Really disappointing Also one night we got a Napoleon to share there we tried to take a bite of it and it was frozen I shouldve said something to one of the people behind the counter but I was just fed up at this point and felt like they wouldnt do anything about it anyways I just asked for a box to take it home to defrost I used to be really excited about going to Amelies now I just try to avoid it I do have hope that it will go back to what it used to be,negative,231,200-250,1151,1000-1500
First the interior is a huge kitsch Second the food wasnt good I orderd tartines with ham brie and figs The bread was ok nothing special Instead of normal ham there was fried bacon Brie was melted and tasted like ordinary melted cheese and figs werent fresh write in the menu that the figs are from jam I paid 6 for that I think it didnt worth it I havent tried pastry so I cant tell anything about Maybe its good and people come here because of it so that is why not 1 star,negative,95,75-100,503,500-1000
I walked past this bakery several times and the macarons caught my eye I definitely had to stop by before I left so I came and got the package of macarons which were like 1750 and consisted of 6 cookies They were huge compared to the ones I had before and run about 360 for one I also got a red velvet cupcake which was huge Love the presentation of the frosting garnished with pieces of chocolate It was about 350 for one and they put it in a cute little box The macarons were good they were soft and chewy and not too sweet I absolutely LOVE the red velvet cupcake BEST EVER Its not too sweet at all just about the right amount of sweetness and the vanilla bean cream cheese frosting is fantastic It spreads all over the top of the cupcake and through the core as well Totally worth it Spent about 25 they didnt have much of a variety but Im satisfied with my purchase ,positive,171,150-200,908,500-1000
Despite how nice he was the teenage counter boy totally judged me when I ordered a double scoop right after devouring a cup of triple scoop Not the best ice cream Ive had and a little pricier than most places but definitely good enough for my afternoon recess time when I just want to indulge in being fat and alone Get salted butter caramel peanut butter chip lavender white rose medjool date Add toasted marshmallow bacon brittle bits Try everything like I shamelessly did,positive,84,75-100,489,<500
A little overrated but still delicious Their set up is a little confusing They have two different doors one side for cupcakes and the other for ice cream Every time I went they had people standing outside in attempt to answer questionsdirect you into the right door I like the concept but didnt like the execution I was honestly a little intimidated I felt like they were very nicely attacking me with flavor menus It also felt a little awkward because Im used to walking by a store front and going in on my own terms I knew going to the Linq that Sprinkles was on my must try list but when I actually got there I felt pressured to go in Anyways the ice cream is delicious My first time there they recommended the cookie ice cream sandwich You order first then wrap around to the other end pay and wait for the goods While I was waiting I couldnt help but notice there were flies landing on the cookiesbrownies sitting in the window they had Im by no means a germaphobe but felt very disgusted I kept watching the flies to make sure they didnt go near the cookies I chose and honestly in my mind they probably already have I just didnt wanna admit it Everything is a bit overpriced here but I expected that Im not a HUGE fan of cupcakes I only tried a couple bites from my friends Pretty good but their frosting is a little sweet Totally biased on my end though Lost my sweet tooth years ago I hope this review doesnt garner hate or offend anyone I was turned off during my first visit with the whole fly thing but I have gone back twice since then didnt notice any flies the last two times Im still a fan just not super impressed,negative,312,300- 500,1690,1500-2000
After the updated COVID19 procedures the University placed on restaurants I expected that Cafe Bene would follow the new rules I even called ahead of going in to do work as I wanted to make sure they were still open and still sanitizing However I am sitting in the cafe right now and there are multiple people without their proper face coveringsmasks on with no food or drinks on the table Additionally I saw the managerowner walk by and employees going by and saying nothing I am extremely uncomfortable and am going to report this as a concern for safety to the University This is absolutely not okay for a business to do at this time especially with cases of COVID19 rising,negative,122,100-150,690,500-1000
I go there a lot but lately Ive been really getting bad I went there and got cookies today the cookies were so hard old nasty I couldnt believe it next time I go I will let them know now Im glad I didnt buy what I was going to buy,negative,51,50-75,234,<500
This place is expensive I guess you would call it Vegas tourist prices From the show lobster tails and cannolis are their specialty Nothing fantastic lobster tail is like croissant with pastry cream and the cannoli has a ricotta filling They sell a small box of assorted butter cookies for just under 1000 and I mean small Been there no need to go back,negative,64,50-75,369,<500
Love this place I tried the 4 sampler for 450 It was well worth it as I enjoyed trying their unusual flavors such as heavenly hash buckeye graham central station and coconut cream pie all of which were delicious but my favorite wax the heavenly hash Great place to take the kids Only down side the indoor seating and they only have two benches outside so having a place to eat your ice cream can be a problem,positive,78,75-100,418,<500
Worst 11 chocolate milk shake ever  according to me and my 4 kids  seriously  UCk,negative,18,<50,91,<500
Came here on a Saturday afternoon with a couple of friends There were a few people in line  2 people behind the counter taking orders  preparing them I think there were 45 people in front of us  it was about a 15 minute wait I usually get the sprinkles sundae The cupcake with a scoop of ice cream The portion is pretty big so I suggest sharing I got the dark chocolate cupcake with the coffee almond fudge ice cream I wasnt a big fan of the cupcake it was too sweet and it was more of a milk chocolate rather than a dark chocolate The ice cream was pretty good though They offer a mini size for the sundae however they only have limited flavors for the cupcake I would probably opt for that one if I come back You can seat your party outside because they have a few tables  chairs They also have a cute cupcake ATM if you dont wanna wait in line  super handy,positive,174,150-200,885,500-1000
This is the review you hate writing Sloans ice cream looks great The people behind the counter are lovely and helpful truly wonderful service The problem is that the ice cream just isnt good Between the five of us we tried 7 different flavors from the usual chocolate to more elaborate concoctions None of the ice cream had much flavor and some of the add ins like pretzels actually tasted stale,negative,71,50-75,406,<500
Ive been here twice its definitely overrated and customer service could use some work also I wont be coming back They packed my carrot cupcake in with my daughters strawberry shortcakenot a good ideal It was a mess by the time we made it to our room and we ended up throwing it away I wasted 25 on absolutely nothing Save you money and time and go to Sprinkles Its just not worth it,negative,74,50-75,399,<500
Excellent bakery sandwiches chai tea BUT I wish their outdoor seating included some area in the sun Charlotte does indeed have 4555 degree day time temperatures so if you have a dog with you you must sit outside in the shade Midday Yoghurt Croissant sandwich too Chai tea,positive,48,25-50,277,<500
Best softserved ice cream I ever had At first when receiving a very dauntingly large ice cream cone I was worried about my ability to finish it But to my surprise tthe ice cream was perfect The temperature was perfect wasnt too cold and didnt melt to fast The matcha flavor of the ice cream was definitely present but not over powering with the addition of the vanilla swirl to add some extra flavor The ice cream had the perfect amount of sweetness I dont have a sweet tooth but I still able to finish the ice cream in one sitting The ice cream was flavor were very subtle easily melting in your mouth yet somehow so perfect in making you addicted to taste more If youre not trying this ice cream and youre from the area you are definitely missing out,positive,142,100-150,767,500-1000
Always friendly Quick service The ice cream reminds you of the old school ice cream parlors The location is great for a for an afternoon at the boardwalk,positive,28,25-50,157,<500
Was so excited to try Christina Tosis milk bar soft serve after seeing her on master chef but ew Tasted like sour spoiled milk just nasty I once got a shake from somewhere else that tasted similar and they told me they accidentally served me from the side that needed to be cleaned This was supposed to be funnel cake flavored but was more like raw funnel cake  The gal at the counter overheard my son say he didnt like it and said the trash can is behind you I stammered a response in shock to that comment another employee came over and they offered him a sticker or cookie but he had wanted ice cream So in the trash can it went  should have asked for a taste first I guess My other kid liked his chocolate shake but I thought it was gross and sour milk tasting too oh well We went next door and paid more for an edible shake,negative,164,150-200,858,500-1000
Excellent selection of items at a good price The macarons are larger than Ladurees and taste much better We picked up six for the price of one this day An amazing deal,positive,32,25-50,172,<500
The best donuts you will ever eat A little piece of heaven I recommend Jack Frost to everyone,positive,18,<50,98,<500
Oh how I wanted to LOVE Hopscotch The interior is darling and some of the artistry done with frosting is magnificent For my birthday I heavily hinted to my husband that I would really really love to have one of their works of art as my cake and he delivered The cake he brought home was pretty although not exactly what he has asked for roses instead of peonies but really not a big deal but the flavor was what we were excited about vanilla blackberry We eagerly cut into the cake after letting it sit out for two hours as instructed to find that on sight it resembled very stale soda bread It was incredibly dense and heavy  and really tough to cut sawing was required Still we remained hopeful but on first bite we struggled to chew the cake that was tough dry and not even a little sweet and I prefer my desserts on the unsweetened side There was no taste of vanilla or blackberry and there was a definite smell and taste of frostbite or perhaps just something very artificial Neither of us could finish our pieces and the rest of the cake was tragically trashed The worst part of this was not that my birthday cake was a total dud but rather watching my husbands face fall as he realized what a disappointment this cake was I am quite pregnant and not able to partake in some more typical celebratory indulgences so he had hoped to get me an epic cake to make up for it I hope others dont have this experience but also hope that the bakers at Hopscotch can work to prevent any future disasters All the pretty icing in the world wont help a cake thats too tough to chew,negative,300,250-300,1615,1500-2000
Some of the best ice cream in the world Period And definitely the best in The Land Favorite is the Caramel Sea Salt,positive,23,<50,119,<500
The place is clean and the staff were friendly But we waited for 15 minuets to get our order and they were not even making ice creams to order as Jarlings does I got the chocolate almond coconut and my friend got their lemon blackberry special Mine was half melted when I got it My friends seemed better but overly sweet It seemed like they have mixed overly sweet blackberry jam with overly sweet lemon ice cream It wasnt lemony and refreshing at all We barely finished our expensive melted and overly sweet ice creams and left Never going back,negative,100,75-100,559,500-1000
Cute little ice cream shop in Scottsdale The toffee banaffee sundae did not disappoint Delicious ice cream and a fun atmosphere,positive,21,<50,130,<500

I went in there for a cup of coffee and found a variety of desserts that looked really appetizing However since it was the morning and I wanted something to go with the coffee I chose a breakfast croissant sandwich and it was the best I feel like Ive had in a long time The croissant wasnt too crisp or dry like other croissants Ive had and the sauteed bell peppersonions on top of provolone cheese  egg was something Ive never thought of doing before I was really glad I went and I hope I can find some time to go back and try the desserts,positive,107,100-150,552,500-1000

I scream you scream we all scream for ice cream I discovered Jenis while living in GA and was so happy to find the south end location here in Charlotte Jenis is the epitome of small batch artisan ice cream The ambience Uber cute tiny shop off Camden road in the heart of south end Its across from Hawkers also amazing The bright Jenis Ice Creams sign can be seen from up the street The line can be seen from there as well Theres almost always a line The food ICE CREAM I love the variety of unique flavors they offer at Jenis Everything from basic vanilla bean and darkest chocolate to sweet cream biscuits and peaches There are also non dairy flavors most with a coconut base Theres even frosÃ You can sample as many flavors as youd like and build your ultimate frozen treat They have single double and triple scoops My fave is the trio Three half scoops of any flavor Accompanied by an amazing piece of waffle cone I came on my birthday the gave me a free trio with a full waffle cone on the side Score Stop by be prepared to wait but itll be worth it,positive,203,200-250,1109,1000-1500
Service bad Disappointed with the cold shoulder and dismissal of the staff Especially the man with the glasses and grey bandana I have been there many times before greeted with great staff but this time was different I am not sure if it was because it was loud cold or just a bad day but he was very rude When I asked if it was good to take the food he waved at me with the dismal like a dog and shortly said Bye At first I was not sure to take this personally but by the way he called out numbers and spoke to other customers it seemed that is just who he is I think other customers felt similarly I got a lunch special from the counter my first time and it was just okay I am not sure if I will be back This store is a really mixed bag between good and bad service food quality is decent Really just disappoint me the first time a waiteremployee has ever treated me this way in general,negative,179,150-200,914,500-1000
In a word meh Had the lobster tail chocolate canoli and a cookie The cookie tasted like it was a day old The canoli was hard and tasteless And the lobster tail was runny and lackluster The staff was also unemotional and stale Im a big fan of Next Great Baker but this was a huge disappointment I feel like Buddy would be ashamed of this place,negative,67,50-75,356,<500
Im disappointed at this Milk Bar And my sister was too after having a good experience at their LA location So I was actually in New York when Milk Bar was getting popular I watched that Chefs Table episode and realized I missed out on trying her cereal milk soft serve After watching the episode I knew I had to go to their Las Vegas location during my weekend getaway there I got the twist of cereal milk and crack pie soft serves Unfortunately I didnt know which side was which because theyre both white It all kind of tastes the same and after 5 mins I threw it all away I tried to finish it especially after paying 6 for it but my stomach started hurting I also wanted to try a slice of birthday cake but it was 14 I know Vegas prices are high as the rent at the Cosmopolitan is high but 14 for a slice of cake I dont care how large it is its still steep especially when the prices are more reasonable in LA If youre wanting to try Milk Bar I say go for it just so you can say youve done it But if youre from LA just try it there And if youre from NYC go to the original location if you havent been there already And if you do plan on eating there the lines can be long Though when I was there around 9pm on a Friday there was no line Tables are between Milk Bar and Eggslut and scarce so just be aware of that,negative,268,250-300,1365,1000-1500

Apparently people rave about this place maybe I talked to the wrong people cause nothing I bought 45 worth was any good Simply put I find Walmart offered better pastries than what I purchased Sad I had high hopes,negative,39,25-50,219,<500

Tried the chocolate almond croissant It was really good but a little too sweet for my taste The pistachio macaron was good,positive,22,<50,125,<500
They should call their salted caramel brownie CRACK Overheard while I was in line Server 1 hands server 2 a box Server 2 gracias Server 1 you should probably say thank you in French since we work in a French bakery Server 2 oh how do you say thank you in french Server 1 hmmmmmmm Merci I think Nothing about Amelies is French BUT their petite fours  salted caramel brownies are aaamazinggggg,positive,73,50-75,408,<500

Came in here for cannolis and wanted to try the lobster tail When I arrived no one was there which was nice and they still had cannolis and lobster tails I ordered 2cannolis 2 salted caramel lobster tails and one cookies n creme lobster tail The cannolis were good but the lobster tails not so much The shells while good I think were slightly over baked The filling on the salted caramel had no caramel flavor at all and the filling for the cookies n creme only had a hint of cookies n creme flavor My mom tried one of the salted caramel lobster tails and agreed they had no flavor Disappointed that I paid 26 for 5 pastries that werent amazing,negative,122,100-150,659,500-1000
I dont think this place is all it is cracked up to be I have had multiple pastries from here and I personally wouldnt recommend it but others I have been with like it,negative,34,25-50,169,<500
You would think at how expensive this place is youll at least get greeted by the person working there  Walked up super excited and didnt even get greeted by the lady that was there  She was RUDE didnt greet us and was not interested in having any kind of customer service skills  Honestly for the price you pay its not worth it  We got the 23 buck pack and I was shocked by how small the pie was  Lol the treats are good but I wouldnt bother coming here  After the fucked up service you get by these rude employees save your money ,negative,110,100-150,543,500-1000
My hubby and I went today and like a lot of other helpers here stated Yep it was a line Mind you its Tuesday around 818pm But please get a number as soon as you see the line because thats who they go about receiving your order I got the California cheesecake which was okay and was nothing to rave about I also got the vanilla buttercream icing cupcake which was a little dry and the salted caramel cupcake which was HORRIBLE The line isnt worthy it whatsoever Please save your money and find another bakery Im still in search of a really good one,negative,105,100-150,569,500-1000
My wife and I have been watching the tv show featuring these products and finally went to the Venetian Hotel to try them We bought two cannolis that were soft and extremely tasteful The cannoli cups were filled with cheesecake that was delicious and beyond all our expectations Dont listen to the negative reviews on these delicious products,positive,58,50-75,347,<500
When I first starting going to Amelies the food was great and the service was great Over the past few months I would occasionally go there to get breakfast and coffee Every single time Id go Id be waiting an hour for my food and almost every single time they would forget an item in my order Today was the last straw I ordered an egg sandwich with soup Took them 30 minutes not busy to get my food and they Forgot my soup And didnt put EGG on my egg sandwich Im done throwing my money away,negative,98,75-100,514,500-1000
I dont get the people who think this is the best bakery in the world I have tried something here a halfdozen times and each time the only thing I ever thought was OK was the coffee The last 2 times I didnt even bother going in Instead my wife and her friend waited in line for an eternity to get small boxes of treats to eat on the way home from the breweries Although I am always pleased to create a reminder in my google calendar when I can remind my wife of a time I was right  it will also remind of a time when my wife spent my money on overpriced pastries that are dry and more or less bland Both times my wife agreed that it was not very good when her friend asked why is it so busy then my wife responded sheeple Luckily Abari and Free Range brewing are close enough to where the wife was able to drop me and her friends husband off to drink and play TMNT the arcade game,negative,180,150-200,903,500-1000
The absolute worst customer service I tried to make a phone order and apparently because she was too busy she felt my order must not have been important The lady on the phone was snarky and rude Told me to go to their website and the website said to call for whats available Its clear they dont want you to call them Absolute worst service Ive ever received Plenty of other local bakeries that would take my business I am just astonished by the lack of professionalism and the horrid customer service WILL NEVER RECOMMEND OR RETURN,negative,97,75-100,549,500-1000
hit or miss really crack pies are good but the crack pie latte is awful this place is lacking consistency,negative,20,<50,108,<500
I was excited to try their cupcakes after hearing all the rave reviews Unfortunately I was disappointed by what I tried My wife and I bought 4 cupcakes in 4 different flavors A red velvet chocolate marshmallow Dark Chocolate and another that I dont recall On all 4 the cake was pretty dry and crumbly and not moist at all The cake also lacked flavor and was really quite bland The marshmallow cupcake had hardly any filling in it at all The one saving grace was that the frostings were all pretty flavorful but not enough to save the cupcake Ive had Georgetown Cupcakes both shipped to my home and visited their location in Los Angeles and theirs are far better than Sprinkles To add insult to injury they charge 375 per cupcake which is more than Georgetown Overall theyre overpriced for an inferior product I probably wont waste my money on their cupcakes again,negative,155,150-200,888,500-1000
Do not get MILK TEA or BOBA Tea from here They had to remake my drink The first time did not have ice And it did NOT taste good NO FLAVOR Tasted bland and gross There are better boba places in Vegas,negative,42,25-50,207,<500
Ive read great reviews on this place and still see friends suggesting it to other friends heading to Vegas but we were not impressed to say the least The cake was terribly dry and obviously way over priced Would skip this and just enjoy desert at one of the fine dining that is readily available in Vegas,negative,57,50-75,309,<500
Want in for breakfast bough cream cheese danish and coffee everything was just delicious very next morning we want in for coffee and a Han and cheese crason Turkey baget crason tested fine but the turkey baget was unadable we both agree it must have been sitting there from at least two days dont serve people food you would not eat yourself for 4000 we could have a brakefest buffet at the Cesaers Hotel,negative,74,50-75,411,<500
Creamy soft serve End of story its so good that you can eat it plain But why when this place offers dips Cherry chocolate and yes even blueberry Its a semi soft candy shell My daughter got the medium cherry dip cone it was huge I had a yum turtle Sunday The soft serve covered with chocolate sauce caramel and pecans heaven in a cup Menu has all sorts of Sundaes Saw people enjoying Some were eating out right huge ones We brought home ice cream sammies Chocolate cookie filled with that same dreamy vanilla This place is that good A line on a cold spring night 38 degrees  At 930pm If that doesnt tell you something You order at the window This is Outside my yelping friends outside,positive,130,100-150,693,500-1000

For the many times Ive been to Vegas I never made it to Bouchon Bakery when it was open The closed sign is the worst when all you want to do is sink your mouth into an edible delight that is a macaroon Fear notas I made it a point to get here for a tasty treat this time around The salted caramel was extra caramely and sweet but ohsodelish,positive,70,50-75,354,<500
one of those crazy people who waited in line for 20 minutes during the soft opening at 900 pm on a Friday night yes its good yes its really good and really fresh their dairy free chocolate is incredible it is so rich and satisfying Ive had bites of Justins dairy concoctions which have included lavender chocolate chip and salted caramel from memory they havent had mint chocolate chip yet but Im sure they will at some point weve been twice now but on the third time when the line was over 20 minutes we decided to bail thrilled that CLT is one of the few cities that Jenis has expanded to its such a bright literally spot in South End which makes our neighborhood even better,positive,127,100-150,714,500-1000
TERRIBLE Im hoping Buddy sees this I was so excited to try his bakery without the flight east Everything looked awesome but then we took a bite We tried the rainbow cake and Im sorry but I could make a better tasting frosting with my eyes closed It was so gross But we continued on to the famous lobster tail I didnt know it would be like eating an actual lobster tail It was hard and EXTREMELY chewy It truly was disgusting and inedible Next we had the cannoli and third time the charm Ill say it was better than the other two but nothing Id buy again How did he get famous with horrible deserts Ill never know Im ready for Buddy to prove me wrong,negative,127,100-150,678,500-1000

Hm for an italian bakery they have rly bad cannolis I took a bite and threw it awayI got it chocolate dipped and the shell was a little soggy but fine The filling was odd tasting like spoiled milk Luckily the strawberry eclair was better  The choux pastry had a nice crisp on the outside and slight softness on the inside The cream wasnt too sweet and strawberries tasted fresh However for such a wellknown bakery it was very subpar Ive had so many more cannolis and eclairs elsewhere that have been so much better Cake boss let me down ,negative,102,100-150,557,500-1000
The only French cafe Ive ever been to in Charlotte is Renaissance Patisserie so I wanted to try a new place out of curiosity I know Amelies is very popular here in the Queen City so I decided to go here one night after a romantic dinner date at a very nice Italian restaurant Upon walking in to Amelies I felt like a stepped back in time and was transported to France Gorgeous decor and I really love the style of the place It made me feel like I was inside a little dollhouse The food did not impress me like the decorations did I got a slice of chocolate peanut butter cake and it was SO DRY I couldnt even finish it Absolutely disgusting I took 3 bites and tossed the rest in the trash I also got 2 macarons and those were alright It didnt taste as good as macarons Ive gotten from other places I was very disappointed with the food here and I cant believe this place is so popular in Charlotte Im gonna stick to Renaissance Patisserie whenever I want to go to a French cafe,negative,191,150-200,999,500-1000
So bummed but this place is definitely not open It is surrounded by caution tape and its boarded up,negative,19,<50,102,<500
I have never been more insulted I used to love this little gem in Noda but after visiting tonight I plan to never go back The Young woman behind the pastry counter with her hazard of a razor blade necklace was ridiculously rude and publicly embarrassed me I didnt hear her the first time I thought she had said I couldnt be inside without a mask So okie dokie I grabbed a mask and reentered Completely understandable Oh no she yelled at me that I couldnt be inside the establishment because I have open wounds well no I do not have open wounds I have poison ivy rash Its not contagious YOU HAVE TO GO OUTSIDE its a health concern you arent allowed inside as she chases me out while im exiting now that I realize it had nothing to do with not having a mask the first time According to her management doesnt allow people with poison ivy inside im a health hazard Now I ask had i said it was psoriasis or another skin condition would she have treated me the same Likely This business should be ashamed I could understand if I had Covid or another serious CONTAGIOUS sickness but wow,negative,204,200-250,1121,1000-1500
The pastries are absolutely divine We had a bacon egg croissant and best cheese danish on the planet That being said the service was terrible My husband had a 20 min break from his conference so we came here to grab a quick pastry After 15 min of waiting for our croissant my husband went to ask well it was still in the toaster oven The workers never apologized they just got another croissant and began toasting it again Wish the staff was better trained on what to do in these kinds of situations they were flustered and just gave us the new croissant and brushed us on our way,negative,110,100-150,595,500-1000
We stopped at Novel tonight after dinner The guys running the shop were great explained everything gave us samples I didnt hold out much hope for ice cream in a donut but that was the headliner so I gave it a shot It was probably one of the best deserts that I have ever had Enough said It was that good It wasnt as heavy as I expected I will recommend this place to everyone I know Quality product great service,positive,81,75-100,428,<500
I am not impressed and quite frankly I think this place is overrated Yes for local standards their bread is better than the usual horrors of American bread That said the bread is not great I bought a baguette at Batch Bakehouse on a Saturday morning by 3 pm it was hard and stale This tells me that the bread was either already a day old when I bought it or they dont know what they are doing I spent the better part of my life in Europe and believe me fresh bread does not behave like this The brownies they sell are way too sweet and the croissants are just meh While I am willing to pay  for good bread and baked items I dont think that their quality and price match,negative,134,100-150,688,500-1000
The atmosphere is great and the coffee was good However the tiramisu was frozen on the inside In a neighborhood with so many options for great Italian food go somewhere that actually bakes everything fresh,negative,35,25-50,210,<500
Good carbs bad carbs I dont really care Its located by the clock tower in Venetian and thought it would be perfect to grab a light breakfast from here They have many delicious pastries and drinks to choose from The line was long at first but went by quickly with how fast the employees were attending to everyones order The best part of service is also keeping in mind about time and not making customers wait too long which I found to be a great at Bouchon bakery because they were fast My husband and I both ordered iced coffee which was good both times we came here Tasted like regular iced coffee and had milk cream sugar on the side for you to add your own preferred amount As for the pastries we ordered the strawberry danish chocolate almond croissant almond croissant and fachiche Seriously all of these pastries were so good that with every bite I didnt know if I should feel guilty or happy The almond croissant and strawberry danish were my top favorites Ive never tried strawberry danish and now its one of my favorites thanks to Bouchon My husband loved the almond croissant and barely shared with me which shows how delicious it was This bakery is convenient delicious and not too pricey so do check this place out,positive,224,200-250,1256,1000-1500
My favorite is the ice cream sandwiches The cookies are huge and yummy Little over priced for ice cream but fun flavors and great welcoming environment Staff is incredibly friendly,positive,30,25-50,185,<500
Ordered the cappuccino splatter at their Pemberton phx location Horrible Had no cappuccino or coffee flavor at all and cost 8 for one cup Complete ripoff,negative,26,25-50,159,<500
Drove over an hour to get here Parking was a bit rough on a Sunday morning It was quite busy when we first arrived I felt a bit lost being a first timer Apparently you have to pull a number and they will help you It will be good to know what exactly what you want bc when they call your number you will feel extremely rush the first lady wasnt very helpful at answering any questions I had regarding to the bake goods Then a second girl took over my order bc I guess I asked too many questions lol The cashier computer system was down so it was so hectic The food was mediocre If you live around the area its a good place to spend your morning but its definitely not worth an hr drive Not even a 15 mins drive considering how bad parking is The food or bake good isnt worth the hassle thats for sure,negative,161,150-200,818,500-1000
Buddys baked goods are not overrated I wanted to sample everything I visited Carlos twice during my trip The 2nd time especially I got greedy ordered too many items ate them all couldnt stop SO GOOD,positive,36,25-50,210,<500
Stopped in to make a quick purchase of a bottle of milk They were in the process of closing and had one person working the counter and three people cleaning up in the restaurant Literally stood at the cash register for four minutes with a bottle of milk no one else in the place except one person mine something at the counter Finally asked one of the people closing the restaurant downbakery hey do you sell this milk or not Oh I only clean up he only cleans up shes the only person that can help you keep your milk keep your crappy cookies next,negative,105,100-150,553,500-1000

Love love love the pastries and atmosphere The salted caramel brownies are orgasmic I also recommend any of the layered tortes My only complaint is that the counter is crammed up front which creates long lines Otherwise I think this is the best bakery Ive ever been to and Ive been all over the world Its sinfully good,positive,58,50-75,333,<500
I got the cake and shake combo for 22 This should be considered robbery charging people 10 for what tasted like a Wendys frosty with chunks of cake and sprinkles Because of the sugar rush from my Shake i have yet to try my 14 slice of frosting packed cake 2 saving for getting the combo more like 22 in the toilet Fear of a diabetic coma wins this review,negative,70,50-75,371,<500
Good ice cream Kind of pricey Super unique and artsy part of town We had a drink next door and stopped by after It was good,positive,26,25-50,128,<500
Carlo has good desserts The lobster tail my husband tried and the cannoli I tried however the service is the laziest I have ever seen Standing in line for over 20 mins and then after ordering from the slowest waitresses to then having to stand in another line while they wrap your food then wait for cashier to pay Bad reflection on the manager to have a staff with no urgency in a city like Vegas with tons of people I feel the service can be so much better The ladies stand around chatting while wrapping at a slow pace One girl held up the line waiting on tiramisu that was already in the case and she didnt know it Sad sad service Utter ridiculousness Never seen anything like it,negative,130,100-150,695,500-1000
They are super nice and helpful here I was a first time customer and they gave me helpful opinions so I could choose a flavor I went for a boba drink mango with strawberry popping boba Ive never used a paper boba straw so that was cool they had that My drink was a little too sweet for me but I think that was just my personal preference I would definitely come back and try something different,positive,77,75-100,403,<500
All you have to say is Babcock Hall Ice Cream The best in the state This shop is in the Memorial Union in addition to the location near the dairy barns in Babcock Hall Going to Babcock Hall as a child was always a treat for our family Glad its now easier to get to in the Memorial Union All the flavors are great tasting,positive,65,50-75,328,<500

Unfortunate that youll stand there waiting for service and no one will speak to you Then another customer comes in and is immediately helped Walked out without buying and will never visit this place again,negative,35,25-50,208,<500
Customer service sucks came to pick up my online pre ordered cake and pastries for my wedding anniversary manager or lead there said they sold out the cake and the pastries that I pre ordered so just pick out a random cake that is same price but thats not right and that is straight so wrong I pre order and paid for it to make sure I will get the right cake for my occasion now they ruin my anniversary They should have called me to let me know that they sold the cake and pastries I ordered ahead of time  Hoping that this store have a better system taking care of their pre orders or they will lose a lot of customers ,negative,125,100-150,629,500-1000
YUM If you have never been to Jenis you had better crawl out from under that rock youve been under LOL Jenis is the goto place in Charlotte for ice cream It is sooo good Be warned the line is almost always 20 people deep and snaked outside of the building The line does move quickly and Ive never waited longer than 10 minutes to get to the counter to order My go to flavors are the gooey butter cake salted peanut butter and the brown butter almond brittle Love their waffles cones  they are fresh and you can watch them make them in house It can be a little bit pricey especially for pints but it is certainly a treat with flavors you wont find elsewhere,positive,128,100-150,675,500-1000
Handels we love coming here Your ice cream is top notch but your customer service has slipped and fast With no line tonight and orders for 2 hot fudge sundae why could not the team chip in and help make the 2 orders Instead we stand around as 2 employees look at social media sites and take pictures Poor service makes me question coming back,negative,65,50-75,347,<500
Bay bay thats baby in normal lingo lol Let me tell yallIm never going to a corporate ice cream spot Ever Like ever ever This spot was the absolute best It sits on a corner with limited parking and the inside remind me of a tiny home Its a tight squeeze the two individuals working were super sweet and kind They explained all the flavors where they came from and offered samples of anything we wanted We got a single scoop of freckled lemonade the Madagascar vanilla on a waffle cone a single scoop of Cookie Monster Ill talk about that in a min and the donut thing ice cream sandwich made with donuts wbutter toffee with homemade caramel First there should be a disclaimer or warning sign for the Cookie Monster although she gave me a wipe My son made the biggest mess Sheesh I was trying to eat more of my wifes ice cream because it was so refreshing My review could go on and on but yall get the point It was really good and everyone should support this local business,positive,184,150-200,1010,1000-1500
Conveniently 24hrs awesome macaroons I didnt try them all but definitely a bit pricey I havent tried my salted caramel brownie yet but I hear great things The croissant was nothing special to be honest I wonder if I couldve asked for it to be warmed up now that Im thinking about it,positive,53,50-75,297,<500
So dissapointed with my last trip there first I absolutely loved this little place  I love how they are open late and the location and the flavors of the ice cream so delicious  BUT my last trip learned they discontinued the flights of ice cream  And it was hot as hell outside and they were out of water like wtf  Were in Arizona why the hell are you out if water  then the guy at the register was kind of dumb or stupid not sure which one but I had a punch card that literally need one more punch to get a free ice cream and he said we dont honor those anymore  Excuse me  So now that Im the last one you dont honor them anymore smh  bad business move if you discontinued it fine but you should still honor the remaining cards people have then he offered to still punch the card for shits and giggles I guess what a fuckin idiot lol smh Ill never go back there ,negative,180,150-200,901,500-1000
I was going to give three stars because I dont really get the hype tbh But after comparing prices with cold stone I decided Novel should get a cool 4 stars I got the ice cream bourbon toffee iirc in a donut It was good But I think any store bought ice cream inside of any store bought glazed donut would taste exactly the same Yummy sweet ice cream and donut Nothing special or unique flavor or texture wise The donut gets a little soggy I think they may have heated the donut but I couldnt tell for sure It was lukewarm Not sure how it is supposed to be not a criticism just an observation Id get it again if in the area and having a craving for ice cream,positive,131,100-150,681,500-1000
Oh my goodness So yummy It was about 930 pm and there was a long line but my guy and I were ready to wait because everything looked so tasty The line moved fast and we left with 4 cupcakes chocolate marshmallow vanilla sprinkle pumpkin and red velvet we had some that night and the others the next night They were all delicious and moist You must try them,positive,69,50-75,374,<500
My wife is a fan of the show so we stopped by while visiting family in Vegas While in line we asked the employee monitoring the line if lobster tails were still available because it was late and near closing She went to check and told us that they would make some for us Fantastic When we made it the counter we ordered two tails and the worker told us she would check She asked another employee who rolled her eyes and said Just tell them we are out She did and I explained what the other employee had said and so she went to check in the back She came back with two tails I forgave the bad attitude because it was late at night and I understand that the workers wanting to go home However the other part of our order was filled incorrectly which we did not discover until we got home The store was closed by then so there was no way to remedy the error The items were good but not what we wanted A few days later we stopped by on our way out of town and got some treats An hour later on the interstate we opened the boxes to discover that one item had been left out of our order It was a cookie that my seven year old wanted Because of the show he wants to be a baker when he grows up After arriving home I called and asked for a refund for the cookie we did not receive I was told that they could not do that and instead they offered to replace it Great except that I was in Boise Idaho and could not driving back to Vegas for a cookie I explained this and was told If you dont want it thats your choice and they hung up Because of the way I was treated in person and on the phone I will not go back and I recommend that you avoid this place as well I would give zero stars if it were possible While the lobster tail was delicious the other things were just okay Poor employee attitude and lackluster customer service have killed many businesses Unless Carlos fixes these this location is doomed to fail as soon as the novelty of visiting a bakery seen on TV wears off Shame on you Buddy for allowing this to happen at your familys store,negative,408,300- 500,2087,2000+
I was very excited to try this place as a coworker and I had a very long stressful day at work and needed a quick pick me up Upon arrival we were greeted and found it surprising that when we asked to see the menu the cashier left for about ten minutes After taking our order I asked of we could add an additional item to which have rolled her eyes and headed back to the kitchen As we were paying she provided me with the receipt and was annoyed when I asked for a pen to sign the receipt We sipped on our drinks and surprisingly they were bland and gave us all a headache Unfortunately we will not be returning back,negative,123,100-150,622,500-1000

I have been following this place on Instagram since before they opened and finallyyyyyyy got across town to try it out I got the oatmeal pies and Oreo truffle cookie and let me just say it was the best cookie Ive ever had in my life No exaggeration It taste exactly how the pictures look lol only minor minor complaint is that it was obvious I had never been there and the cashier wasnt any help at all I asked was there a menu I was aware that they dont always have the same desserts and the cashier stated there wasnt one because it changes daily then I asked for prices and she told me between 24 then kinda walked away just wouldve like to had known details on what were in the treats and specific prices I wouldve bought more if she was a tad bit more attentive The treats made up for it,positive,155,150-200,816,500-1000
This place is amazing My number one go to for ice cream in Cleveland Located in the Ohio city hingetown area Every flavor Ive had of ice cream is superb My favorite is the matcha green tea ice cream when they have it Love that they create unique flavors They also have vegan options as well and sorbets Once a month Ive noticed they do a pop up ramen shop Superb best ramen in town They get good food and a sense of community at this place The owners are kind and amazing If your in the area stop in you wont regret it,positive,104,100-150,533,500-1000
If you want to wait in line for sub par cheesecake this is your place Its drier then their biscotti Cheesecake Factory for once a much better stop,negative,28,25-50,151,<500
Since I live in the south now I dont get to enjoy the ethnic bakeries like I did when I was a kid growing up in Cleveland I was literally a big kid in a candy store except the candy store was an Italian bakery and deli Got a nice variety of cookies and a small antipasto Kolachys and macaroons were my favs We arrived at 3pm in a Saturday and there was no wait Parking wasnt too bad just found a spot in a side street Staff was very friendly Will be back,positive,94,75-100,467,<500
I cannot believe this place has 45 stars overall it actually blows my mind I have been to hundreds of bakeries including the amazing bakeries of NYC and have to say this is the worst bakery I have ever been to First of all my fiancÃ and I ordered one coffee and three very small pastries We had an apple pie to eat at their cafe and took home a chocolate matcha cupcake and a coconut cream pie The apple pie had a decent flavor but was mostly crust The apple chunks were extremely small and there werent nearly enough to make it a moist apple pie My fiancÃ did say that his coffee was good The following day we tried our desserts that we choice to bring home and they were inedible My chocolate matcha cupcake tasted like dirtgrass We each tried a bite and then ended up throwing it away My fiancÃ said the coconut cream pie had next to no flavor and that was partially wasted as well I cannot believe that I wasted 22 on this place So disappointing to say the least,negative,187,150-200,993,500-1000
Terrible customer service I dont want to fault her too much because Im sure serving drunk tourists for a living is not fun but the cashier had a really negative vibe and attitude Lots of eye rolling curt and terse dialogue and she even threw down our order on the counter I had the slice of crack pie which Id say is overrated It was good but not 700 good for an 18 slice of a maybe6 inch pie The store itself and the pie had a whimsical presentation Glad I tried it but its not something Id crave,negative,99,75-100,516,500-1000
Came here with my sister for the first time Their service is very friendly and inviting They location is difficult to find so just keep your eyes open for their sign I ordered their ice cream macron sandwich which was amazing Their cookie was tasty and soft This place is great for children and families,positive,55,50-75,309,<500
Stopped in today with my niece and nephew It was 90 degrees outside and we rang the doorbell on several occasions and they still opened 10 minutes late and didnt apologize My niece and nephew requested certain items nothing unusual vanilla and chocolate and were told they could only have one or the other And also they werent allowed to pick out which sprinkles they wanted Were in the age of COVID and thought getting some ice cream together as a family would be a nice idea but this experience and the young woman working made it such a bad uncomfortable experience that we will never come back It put a terrible taste in our mouth and Im not only talking about the ice cream,negative,125,100-150,690,500-1000
I was super excited to try Carlos bakery Ive been a fan for a long time and everything looks so good I ordered 4 cannolis 2 lobster tails I only got 1 and a box of sprinkle cookies I payed 50 something to have one missing from my box Pastries were nothing special and pricey Definitely not a place I would recommend or go back to Not worth my money,negative,70,50-75,361,<500
Okay I am Dripps regular now and I have to go with 5 stars Be it their ice cream or tea they are incredible Not only do they boast of Instagram worthy pics but they are unbeatable in the taste wise too They are sisters from Pokitrition and must say they know what works Eat at Pokitrition and get 20 off at dripps I have tried their thunder Oreo minions icecreams and each one is different from the other and totally good Their rose milk latte is my fav the Flavors are so good and its definitely for the rose lovers Overall a must place though their price range is over the top its definitely worth it,positive,117,100-150,618,500-1000
The staff were so nice  helpful And the donuts were yummy theyre just really really sweet thats why I gave them 4 stars for all the ups The only downfall The prices Its really pricey But they only sell til they run out so get there quick,positive,48,25-50,249,<500

Yesterday I paid a visit to my favorite bakery in Charlotte to only find out that they are price gauging their long term customers It was very noticeable that they were no lines at all on Saturday We noticed immediately that the tartlets were marked up over two dollars more than the normal pricing A simple small cake which is now 529 A tartlet we would normally have for 329 is now 529 I think what surprised us the most was the quart of soup that was always 999 is now1400 The plates are even smaller to Even soup and sandwich was marked up 300 higher and a much smaller portion of soup They dont even give you bread with the soup anymore They even took the water cooler from the back away Yes it was very obvious change in management or pure greed  We asked why the prices soared so high and her answer was production cost The soup is the grandmas recipe and it is a simple recipe for the leak soup Shame on you for taking advantage of your customers This is deplorable and disgusting Your employee looked it at us straight twice and said production costs We would normally bring home box of goodies to share with my daughter This was a very special place for both of us to spend our Saturday afternoon We notice how your customers were not walking out with boxes of goodies We noticed your lines were very short actually obsolete If you sad to see an ioconic establishment cheap their customers for the almighty dollar You definitely lost us as a lifetime customer  Do not go there unless you want to be ripped off,negative,286,250-300,1561,1500-2000
Good ice cream inept staff and leadership We were in town for the Final Four and went to Mary Coyle on that Sunday My daughter unfortunately left her sunglasses thereRay Bans a gift from her grandmother I called the shop that night and they said that the glasses were found theyre behind the counter and we could pick them up the next day Monday Unbeknownst to us and the staff apparently the shop is closed on Mondays and we were leaving first thing Tuesday morning We left town I called the shop when they opened on Tuesday explained the situation and asked if they could please send the sunglasses to our homewed gladly reimburse via check or I was happy to PayPal someone for the cost Id even transfer the money first just so they knew I was good for it That was over a month ago In that time after multiple calls weve been told that the manager needs to get involved to the owner needs to get involved weve even been told the owner had already sent the glasses back to us We still dont have them its been a total runaround No one on that staff from top to bottom has had the decency to do the right thing Its been treated as totally insignificant and the right path is so easyquote me a number Ill PayPal you the money and then drop it off in the mail Ill even kick in a tip for your troubles Ive now asked a friend who lives in the area to drive over there pick them up and hes going to ship them back to us Just insane to have to go through this,negative,284,250-300,1513,1500-2000
I hadnt been to Prestis in years and now I remember why The days of the pride that bakeries like Corbos and Prestis use to have is long since over All it takes is a few generations and a lack of wanting to preserve something of value and just general laziness to ultimately lead to a businesses downfall I ordered a breakfast sandwich and asked them to toast it in the toaster oven to heat it up The outside seemed warm enough but when I bit into it the egg was lukewarm and the sausage was cold I asked if they could put it back in because it was still cold the reply was not after it has crossed the other side of the counter Seriously She said oh well you can use the microwave Sure I could if I want to have a soggy mess If you are going to sell premade breakfast sandwiches expect your customers to ask to have them heated up Or better yet take some PRIDE in your work and make them fresh I should have demanded my money back I will NOT be going back Customer service is LAST on their list,negative,198,150-200,1035,1000-1500
OMG This place is eclectic and the food awesome The staff are super nice and helpful It is unfair however the desert counters are first when you are in line and they are so good you HAVE to buy some deserts Then you get to the regular food section and selection is good and tastes great,positive,56,50-75,293,<500
Our new favorite ice cream shop in all of Cleveland and believe me I have tasted almost all of them Incredible inventive flavors super staff who really want you to get what you would like best and aloe you to taste as many flavors as you please Our favorites so far have been captain crunch marzipan oatmeal cream pie and banana pudding,positive,62,50-75,343,<500
Im a big fan of CAKE BOSS so going to the bakery was a must I was dissapointed The lobster tail was meh and the canoli wasnt very tasty The chocolate cupcake was also not very good I rather make my own ghiradelli boxed cup cakes at home ,negative,49,25-50,248,<500
Best cupcake ever beats out Georgetown cupcakes hands down Red Velvet Vanilla and chocolate I just wish I had bought more,positive,21,<50,130,<500
Most overrated ice cream in the city Its not bad by any means but definitely not worth standing in a line for Theyve got maybe one great flavor Plus its overpriced and not worth the small portions Save yourself the time Theres at least two other ice cream joints that are worlds better in close proximity You may not get the super cute selfie in front of the sign like you can at Jenis but at least youre actually paying for good ice cream instead,negative,85,75-100,464,<500
Today is Feb 6th I purposely drive out from my home to 85 degree to preorder a cake to be picked up on Feb 11th I waited in line and finally got to order a cake then I was told it must be 7 days in advance I thought I heard her wrong but she reconfirmed that MUST be 7 days in advance if I want to preeorder a cake The cashier also told me to stop by on the 11th and see if the cake that I wanted to order 5 days in advance is available for sale I am not sure if there was a sign saying 7 days in advance for any preorder cake but I think this policy is the worst I have ever heard from a bakery Suzuya only need 48 hours in advance therefore I am going to Suzuya Goodbye and good luck to you 85 degrees,negative,153,150-200,714,500-1000

Love this place Great desserts in a great area The area is really cool looks like they took a neighborhood asked the residents to leave and turned the houses into places of business But nice businesses Im sure thats not what happened but its a great neighborhood Lots of different delicious looking flavors I go with the ever safe chocolate every time Yummy Service was great and place was cute Check it out,positive,73,50-75,423,<500
Their Macarons are really really good compared to the 2nd tier ones in restaurants They have a range of flavors like Chocolate Vanilla Pistachio and Raspberry I like the Pistachio one the best They also have seasonal flavors like Cherry Chocolate lemon and strawberry the strawberry one this case was bomb The price for one is ok I ordered an Iced Latte once which was good but its really strong coffee so if you like Dunkin Donuts its a complete reversal For this review I am referring to the Bouchon inside the Venetian Casino not the one near Las Vegas Blvd Theres actually two Another good thing about this establishment is that since its located at the Venetian you get free parking on the Strip I would definitely come back because the macarons are the best I have had there is no inconvenient parking and theres no wait time,positive,149,100-150,855,500-1000

I came to Prestis Bakery during my stay at Ohio and its probably my favorite part of little Italy Its shockingly busy after dinnertime because everyone wants to have a snack after their actual dinner Be prepared to grab a ticket and wait in a line for over several minutes if you come during popular times of the day Also parking sucks anywhere at Little Italy Their cannolis are delicious and should be considered a heavy snack The amaretto lobster tails were kinda okay Dont get a lobster tail if youre older and have issues with your teeth because you can truly hear the crunch that resounds out when you bite into it The second time I went before lunchtime it wasnt busy I ordered a chocolate mousse and said itd be a togo order So the guy across the counter came me a takeout container Later my companion and I decided that we should eat inside the cafÃ Im an environmental friendly person so I took the plastic takeout container back and apologetically asked for a plate instead Well the guy gave me a stare down and scolded me saying that I was at fault because I didnt ask for a plate earlier He still gave me a plate in a huff though Dang dude I already apologized and its not skin off your back to give me a freaking plate Im not sure if Id recommend this bakery After all Corbos is next door and Im sure their workers nicer based on the first time I went to Corbos,negative,261,250-300,1418,1000-1500
Definitely not good for kids Very offensive music playing I dont think Yelp would let me repeat the lyrics in a review so how is it okay to assault our ears with that shit It belongs in the club or at home I wouldnt take my family here again My daughter didnt even like her icecream It was mushy and dripping and she loves almost all icecream Avoid,negative,68,50-75,360,<500

Tonight I went to Jenis which I LOVE the ice cream but I paid for a doubleplus tip 10 total and got a single 2 bites of ice cream Obviously the line was super long and its during covid 19 so they were busy and I didnt have a chance go back to the register Im so upset,negative,58,50-75,283,<500
Ice cream was mediocre and I had to ask for the marshmallow which the cookie cup was supposed to come with Only had 2 flavors of macaroons too which were bland Tiny two scoops for 8 dollars,negative,37,25-50,192,<500
Best coffee flavored icecream Ive ever had I had the Vietnamese coffee ice cream on the pretzel cone The saltiness of the pretzel cone mixed with the sweet coffee ice cream was amazing It was hard to get a bite with ice cream and cone though,positive,46,25-50,247,<500
Well when your daughter has a hard time talking because she cant resist the next bite Id say youve found a great spot When you walk outside to enjoy it then when you go to leave decide to go back for some to go for the mrs and theres a brand new flavor Id say its one of the best ice cream places around A must try if you love where you live Local AZ,positive,75,50-75,359,<500

I hate to say it my husband and I were severely disappointed here The ice cream was bland It sort of made sense for mine with vanilla ice cream to be bland but my husbands cookies and cream was blander than my vanilla The presentation of our choices was good but not worth the price nor the taste,negative,58,50-75,304,<500
What can I say This place is iconic here in the South Hills of Pittsburgh Rich with history you cant go wrong on a summers eve with their treats Ive never tasted their actual food they keep adding nondessert items to their menu but there is something about their plain old softserve that does the trick I think its just the fact that its from Pages that makes it so good They also have great milkshakes dirt sundaes and countless varieties of snow cone flavors There may be a line to the street but its worth it Skip Diary Queen and make your way down the street,positive,107,100-150,585,500-1000

I think the place is super cute The employees working the counter were nice  the guy made suggestions for me since it was my first visit I was reading reviews on here  decided I had to try the slice of birthday cake and also got a baby chocolate malt shake I was disappointed in the cake It tasted like regular cheap grocery store cake Had a few bites  threw it away 14 for the cake The chocolate malt shake was very good I enjoyed it Creamy  the pieces of malt were a good ratio My friend ordered the White Russian shake that contains kahlua  vodka He wasnt a fan It was watery  he said it had a weird taste he couldnt describe However there are quite a few choices  these are only a couple things I would not return,negative,146,100-150,742,500-1000
Amelies Its an absolute Charlotte staple honorable mention to the salted caramel brownie but some of the most apathetic service in town in my opinion Im not too amped on going to Ameliesreally at all If youve never been check it out If youre visiting from out of town its a must If youre into kitschy decor by golly what are you waiting for If youre into good pastries look elsewhere When I first moved to Charlotte we were all about this joint Board games open 247 ample seating inside and in the atrium of the 28th Row and plenty of caffeine for latenight work sessions So why 2 stars Apathy The service is just abysmal and the products tend to suffer the consequences as result The trendy little kids behind the counter go out of their way to serve you and dare I say ask whos next in line There are plenty of things right with Amelies Get some staff that actually KNOW the products give them a little more love and then put them in front of people Every time Ive visited which has been sparse in the past few years Ive been in line with newbies They should be swept off their feet as soon as they make eye contact with the staff But instead Ive seen them met with obligatory welcomes and blank stares Upon our last visit we went with some gotos  Vanilla eclair and the chocolate croissant Both were kinda blah Dry had been sitting in the case for what tasted like a good two or three days and arent what they used to be You knowas long as the salted caramel brownie stays the same Im a happy camper I still love you Amelies Youll always have a place in my Charlotteloving heart but your service is just less than desirable,negative,309,300- 500,1717,1500-2000

Since this Mitchells opened up in our neighborhood we have been regularly going here Maybe a bit too regular Im happy that W 25th has a placespace that is accommodating to all ages and backgrounds Everyone loves ice cream I have to admit that I wasnt a fan of Mitchells before this location Many of the locations were out in the burbs and I didnt find it worth it to trek out there I was surprised and happy when I found out they were moving their headquarters to cleveland proper they do love Cleveland and are northeast ohio born and bred The new HQ is beautifulclean light and with modern decor A total revamp of a former movie theatreclub lol They also keep their playfulness their signature model train runs along the ceiling of their main room The ice creams that Mitchell does well and are my favorites Toasted Pistachio Cherry Red buttermilk vanilla tart cherry seasonal Toasted hazelnut  seasonal highly recommend with free pretzel Caramel Sea Salt Rum Babka  seasonal Their vegan ice cream is just ok Good attempt I guess They usually only have 2 flavors available Other places do vegan ice cream better But its cool that Mitchells is a place for vegans too,positive,209,200-250,1219,1000-1500
Very disappointing For the cake boss this place is a complete step in the wrong direction I ordered cannolis which were bland and dry I ordered lobster tails which were absolutely disgusting The sfogliatelle which they are usually very good at making were not available This was in the morning when the bakery should be ready to go at 1030 AM The service is just OK I cant see people who work there seem excited to be there I think they are just there It is right opposite Buddy Vs restaurant It is very expensive For eight lobster tails pastries and six cannolis it was 74 Expensive The worst part is that people who tried everything when I brought it over were less than impressed and I was less than impressed as well I am surprised this bakery is still open because I have been several times and I have been disappointed pretty much every time I finally felt that it was appropriate to write a review because Ive been here at least five times and cannot say Ive ever been all that impressed Very expensive yet not that great,negative,190,150-200,1056,1000-1500

I was waiting for this place to open in Las Vegas because every time I went to California I would stop there and buy a lot of pastriesbread to bring back to Las Vegas I went to the Grand Opening and understand that there was a line outside the store and not a good variety of breadpastries yet because after all it was their first few days operating a new business HOWEVER a few days later 47 outside a VERY COLD EVENING and a young lady lacking TOTAL experience in dealing with people stood at the door and made us wait in the cold NOT too many people inside but the wait lasted about 20 TWENTY minutes After inside and waiting in line again to pay I noticed that someone else was standing at the door and letting everyone else in without waiting I havent been back since then and have told all my friends and coworkers about this lack of respecttraining in dealing with people It needs to be addressed because people will not come back to a place where they were mistreated It NEVER has happened in California Southern or Northern California stores It is a local mismanagement Thank you,negative,202,200-250,1117,1000-1500

I am big fan of Donuts and believe me I have been to palaces where they have amazing donuts This is by far one of the best donuts place I have been too It is like hidden gem in downtown Place opens on Sundays at 8am pst You will find line forming from 730am 8am store opens and some one comes out from store and counts how many kids they have in line with their family at that timeChef and his assistance comes out with plate of freshly made donuts for kids and gives them each Assistance hand over balloon to kids Then they start serving you You get in the shop and welcomed with smile and amazing smell of fresh donuts cream and coffee They take time to serve you answer your questions and get your order ready By the time you get to cashier your order is ready Place is clean great happy environment awesome service and amazing donuts MUST VISIT THIS PLACE AND HAVE DONUTS,positive,168,150-200,904,500-1000
The best ice cream place I have ever been to I cant believe I havent reviewed this place till now but trust me I have been coming here every chance I get This is a small store but with some award winning flavors Brandon is extremely nice and makes his customers feel super welcome He takes his time to explain all the flavors while being patient as everyone gets to try the flavors The ice cream itself is so creamy and on the thicker side so it just feels and tastes so much better than any other slowchurned ice cream at the store They have rotational flavors as well but their award winning vanilla and butter pecan are some of the best of those flavors I have ever had ever Everything about these flavors taste authentic and real and there is no other way to describe the flavors other than to try them yourselves I will keep coming here whenever I am in the area and this place is there I have yet to find a place that is as welcoming and amazing as this place and I really think this shop brought back the ice cream loving child in me,positive,201,200-250,1061,1000-1500
Very slow service As soon as I was up to order he immediately rushed me and started rolling his eyes as if I was taking too long to order 3 classic crepes I handed him my card he slams it on the counter instead of handing it to me Very rude and disrespectful stay away,negative,55,50-75,272,<500
We found this gem recently and so happy about it We have tried halo halo and tahoso delicious They also have very interesting ice cream flavors that are very tasty too Cant wait to go back again and try everything A huge bonus that everyone there are incredibly nice and helpful,positive,51,50-75,287,<500
Extraordinary customer service from the guy and gals at the counter today Its consistent too Every time I have been here the service has been great Todays candy cane shake was cool and refreshing in a pepperminty type way The salted chocolate chip cookie was fantastic and not too heavy on the chocolate like some chocolate chunk cookies are Be warned Churn is not cheap but theyre definitely serving up high quality ice cream and baked goods Its a good place for gifts too they had very nice makeyourown cookie and hot chocolate sets plus little toys and unique candies If youre willing to fork over a few more dollars than DQ further down the road youll be pleasantly surprised Dont forget to use the newer super convenient parking lot next to the WindsorChurnHub building,positive,135,100-150,802,500-1000
Bad news SR has been hit with the ghostly unsolvable sulfur  egg  sewer  hair salon stink that attacks all Scottsdale businesses that dont complain to the city I swear theres a valve the city opens and closes to push the odor to the next business when the previous one complains Ive smelled it from Frank Lloyd Wright to Shea Make no mistake about it when you walk in it smells putrid Service  Older lady working all alone that can only do one thing at a time complaining about how her arm is going to get a good workout today Slow to say the least and theres hardly anyone in here Ice Cream  Delicious original something that sort of makes the comments above worth it Please remove that funky air you got up in there,negative,139,100-150,740,500-1000
This place had me at the ice cream cookie sandwiches Ive never had something that amazing in all my life but be warned its a meal I admit it that was my dinner one night and worth every single calorie There are so many different ways to eat the ice cream there you might not be able to choose to be honest but the cookie is one of the top ways to go,positive,73,50-75,359,<500
It was a little too high in cost for the lack of taste in ice cream I got the coffee flavored ice cream My kid got a cup cake ice cream that was way too rich in taste and was a waist,negative,42,25-50,185,<500
Extremely hard to find Its located under an escalator at a deadend area of the casino Unless you walk all the way to the front door of the Venetian theater and turn around itll be behind you then you could easily spend 30 minutes searching for it like I did Another reviewer said its near Lux Cafenot really Its a good bit away from it The casino signs for it stop when youre still too far away to find it and casino staff seemed not to have heard of it I asked two  one sent me to the Lux Cafe bakery the other tried to send me to the restaurant which is located on another floor Fairly pricy Service was average staff let a drunk woman cut in front of me and said nothing about it They got my order wrong but fortunately I checked my bag and they did fix it when I asked But the biggest reason for 2 stars Seriously underwhelming pastry I ordered a macaron TKO Thomas Keller Oreo a bouchon a croissant and a mini almond loaf and coffee The only things I would have ordered again are the coffee not exceptional but good and the almond loaf which was quite tasty if not ideally fresh The TKO was decent but too sweet  that white chocolate ganache didnt blow me away Im pretty damn sure that everything except possibly the TKO was not baked that same day I went around 11 AM perhaps things are betterfresher earlier,negative,254,250-300,1366,1000-1500
With all the hype surrounding this place I had much higher expectations for it I ordered the cereal milk soft serve 6 with cornflake crunch 1 and was highly disappointed The soft serve straight up tasted like milk with barely any sweetness to it I was expecting it to be like honeymee where the milkiness just meant the soft serve was creamier NOPE I was glad for the cornflake crunch for adding some texture  crunchiness to the soft serve BUT it was salty What I was expecting some frosted flakes typa thing but boy was I wrong I was struggling to finish it because I paid 7 for the thing but I ended up throwing the remainder away anyway cause it was just that bad Overhyped overpriced and not worth I may give it another chance by trying something else on their menu but Im not eager to come back anytime soon,negative,153,150-200,840,500-1000
Amazing donuts and fun staff Come hungry and with a sweet tooth Their donuts as so delicious,positive,17,<50,95,<500

Son of a Batch Why why are you blocks closer to me now Even worse Im at Ace everyday it seems picking up hardware for my new digs and its so easy to pop across the street to the new space Rawr The chocolatechocolate cookie is insane INSANE Im not sure what gives it the cakey yet solid texture but whatever it is it rocks And on days when you dont have any I cry a little inside Truly I did find a super solid alternative today though the salty chocolate brownie Its almost like the cookie in a fluffier more square shape I really dont think theres anything I havent enjoyed I have yet to take breads out for a test spin next on my list once I make sure Ive made my way though all the sweets When I moved to Madison my friend Dan said Batch is best and I have to hand it to him he knows what hes talking about,positive,165,150-200,849,500-1000
Delicious Get here early or else they will sell out Definitely a must when downtown We had the pop tart donut the homer and the fresh strawberry one that tasted like funnel cake So good,positive,35,25-50,191,<500
One night after a big dinner friends and I stopped by this place and gave them a try The hardest part is finding a parking spot since the downtown area can be quite hard to navigate Melt was quite small and overall quite clean Unfortunately no public loo for me to try And I was ready The dairy products helped tooJk We got a scope of cutecumber which was very refreshing even the neighborhood kitty thought so And a scope of Cookie Monster which my friends thought was the perfect amount of sweetness and chewiness from the cookie and stuff And the blue colour was amazing Overall a great and fantastic little place and we highly recommend you come here today And the cat does too shes hangry,positive,128,100-150,717,500-1000
Im only giving this place 4 stars because Im in love with their crack pie It is everything I want dessert to berich sweet and decadent Maybe its me or my tastes have changed but the cookies just dont hit the spot like they used to Tried the crack pie soft serve this time around but I dont think Id order it again,positive,63,50-75,328,<500

Phenomenal Came in early on a Sunday morning and was lucky enough to snag a French toast donut with the butter jam and syrup sides Got a birthday cake donut stuffed with an Oreo the creme brÃlÃe donut the strawberries and cream donut and a smores pop tart donut The strawberries and cream donut was hands down my favorite light fresh and absolutely incredible 1010 They were all awesome my only gripe was I wish the birthday cake donut had actual birthday cake filling in it besides and Oreo that was the whole reason I got it lol Nonetheless love the vibe here and all of the amazing creations Wish I would have gotten more than 5 but could not physically fit more in my stomach lol Will be back Atmosphere 1010 Value 910 Flavors 1010 Service 1010,positive,138,100-150,780,500-1000
Not the best when it comes to caramel popcorn Its usually stale and the bags are FULL of crumbs and kernels For the price Id expect better quality Shop is cute but doesnt house many really fresh items,negative,38,25-50,207,<500
During my first visit to Amelies I was blown away by the size of the location Despite extending through half of the building it can be difficult to find a seat and Ive struggled to connect to their WiFi The pastries are disappointing and the food is not great either I think its a good place to go if you want to grab a cup of coffee and be amongst others,negative,71,50-75,364,<500
Great desserts and always fresh Have not tried the food,positive,10,<50,57,<500
This place is overrated I would rather do Starbucks The pastries are too pricey and taste stale Coffee is disgusting I have tried almost every kind of coffee here and nothing tastes good The menu is written in unreadable text and the worker doesnt want to help you choose anything and always refer to the menu,negative,56,50-75,316,<500
Stopped into mitchells while traveling through Cleveland and what a gem I got the maple walnut and key lime pie and both were fantastic While there we got to watch people make the ice cream which was a fin experience One of the best ice creams I ever had a must go,positive,52,50-75,269,<500
A Charlotte institution Amelies serves up delicious desserts sandwiches and coffee in a hip NoDa location  24 hours a day Admittedly Ive had better pastries but not at 1230 in the morning While a little removed from the bustle of Uptown it remains one of the best spots in Charlotte to satisfy that latenight craving for caffeine sweets and free WiFi Settle down in one of their comfortable armchairs or grab a cozy table for two order a coffee and a chocolate torte and just enjoy the atmosphere,positive,89,75-100,516,500-1000
I was really excited to try this place after all the great reviews after a special event In fact My husband and I chose it over Payard due to all the excellent reviews We were very disappointed as everything we tried was very ordinary Tried the coffee macaron and chocolated dipped pistachio macaron Good coffee flavor butno pistachio flavor Pistachio one actually reminded me of a chocolate dipped mint oreo cookie Regardless both too sweet Strawberry croissant tasted like a strawberry Entenmanns coffee cake No kidding Carrot cake sandwich thing unmemorable and lacking in flavor Nutter Better cookie sandwich also forgettable and a bit on the overly sweet side Cheese danish was the most likeable of the items we got but also unimpressive The only reason it stood out in any way was the excellent cream cheese frosting on top Overall skip it,negative,143,100-150,863,500-1000
Disappointed I had a big event going on in vegas for a friends birthday and I only wanted the best of the best cakes and since Im a huge fan of Carlos bakery I own all of his baking books I decided to place a cake order on June 5th weeks in advance everything was set until my friend got really ill and we needed to cancel our trip I called about 8 days before I needed it and cancelled it They said they couldnt give me my 98 back but that they would give me a gift card to use at any Carlos bakery as well on the website I was 100 happy with that and I didnt mind at all But Its now July 28th and I still havent received anything I called them twice about it and although they are very nice they need to learn how to work the phone because I got put on hold and hung up on like 3 times Both times Ive called they apologize and they say they are sending it out but its been over a MONTH already and still havent received my gift card Come on Carlos Bakery get with it guys Disappointed fan,negative,205,200-250,1021,1000-1500
Oh Jarlings you are my favorite little ice cream shop I look forward to your opening every spring and mourn your closing every autumn Although they dont have quite the flavor variety of other shops what they do they do best Their vanilla is rich creamy and pure I usually get a snowstorm with just chocolate shavings Its the perfect compliment They offer tons of mixins if youre into that But like I said I think the pure and rich taste of their ice cream custard or whatever it is is the real deal Be ready for the crowds this place is super popular,positive,104,100-150,574,500-1000
I cant rate the quality of the donuts due to the poor service I received I left without purchasing any If you have a certain greeting for your 1st time customers it should be practiced with ALL first timers not just those the staff choose to give the new customer greeting to When I made it known that the same courtesy was not given to me the response was well do you want to buy anything after that disrespectful treatment I made the choice to not patronize this business ever,negative,90,75-100,491,<500
really rude service we went to get two crepes and a customer in front of me said excuse me to get the attention of a worker She annoyingly said yes in a very short tone then another worker was also short with her overall rude and rushed even tho there was no line food overall is just average it costs 150 max to make a crepe but charges u 6 for an average sized crepe with skimpy fillings very underwhelming and disappointed in the very rude service plus food save your money and make crepes at home im surprised they werent better staffed and equipped considering they are barely getting service bad representation of west side market sadly needs new management,negative,121,100-150,682,500-1000
Not too impressed with Prestis I go because everyone claims its amazing but its super crammed and the number system doesnt really work They microwave their pastas and sandwiches so its not fresh They have a great variety of baked goods but Id prefer The Stone Oven or Lunas bakery for that I had their egg and cheese croissant and was super disappointed because the bread was NOT flaky and the cheese was the very cheap kind Prestis is also more expensive than Lunas and stone oven but their quality is not worth it Will say they do have a huge variety which I think makes the place so great and lots of space for studying,negative,116,100-150,641,500-1000
An all around good place for ice cream that has a unique menu with lots of other treats I was a little nervous when I walked into the store because of a group of maskless teenage girls walking around the store and talking very loudly it was hard to hear the server We ordered small ice creams with two scoops each I got kulfi and horchata and my husband got kulfi and german chocolate I was impressed by the unique flavor selection they have flavors like play doh and unicorn poop The ice cream itself was just ok though,positive,99,75-100,531,500-1000
Man oh man do you have to look for this place I had the carrot cake muffin with cream cheese icing which was awesome and the sticky bun which was as delicious as i ate it and what was left on my fingers  Must try more tomorrow This place is well worth the walk the hunt and at about 4 each piece really not that bad of a price for heaven in your mouth,positive,75,50-75,358,<500
I was hoping 85 bakery to open in Las Vegas for a long time and its finally here I have been here five times since it was opened I will probably coming here everyday If its closer to my home My favorites are taro marble salted butter taro danish and lemon cupcakes They tasted the best when you consume within one day Their drinks are also good and prices are very reasonable I wish they could open another location in the other side of the town,positive,86,75-100,458,<500
This place is delicious I love a baked good and man do them make some super tasty ones here From bread to cupcakes to coffee cakes to scones they have it and make it The workers are super efficient friendly and theyll help you make a decision even if its telling you to buy both You only live once They take cash and card,positive,64,50-75,331,<500
Best soft serve in Pittsburgh Especially when blueberries are in season,positive,11,<50,73,<500
bought a 6 pack consisted of a red velvet lemon meringue black  white milk chocolate Cuban coffee and strawberry Cupcakes were all very good moist and not too sweet I also got a scoop of captain crunch ice cream on a red velvet waffle cone because 6 cupcakes wasnt enough right Lol Desserts were good staff was friendly and helpful I never heard of sprinkles before so Im not biased of the hype put upon them but they do certainly have good treats,positive,84,75-100,463,<500
I love this place and they have some of the best breads and pastries Ive had especially for the price but they need to better train their employees to slow down regardless of how busy it is inside On my most recent visit the cashier charged my order wrong including accidentally adding extra items and charging for a more expensive bread than what I got I was offered either a refund or to grab the extra breads I was charged for This shouldnt be the way things are done Because the line was long I just went and grabbed the extra breads that I didnt want or need as to not hold up the line So be sure to check your receipt before you leave the store,negative,127,100-150,665,500-1000
You ever take a bite of something so good and for just a split second youre mad Like youve wasted so much time on other things Their oatmeal pie is incredible Its without a doubt the best oatmeal cookie Ive ever had and the cream filling is a perfect compliment Its not too sweet Its a hefty sandwich about the size of a hamburger with a price to match but its worth every penny We bought some other treats that we havent even touched but if theyre even half as good as the oatmeal pie theyll be fantastic,positive,98,75-100,524,500-1000
Love Amelies coffee  bacon egg  cheese croissant I add spinach  its wonderful,positive,15,<50,86,<500
I had to try this place after seeing it everywhere TRASHED it after 2 bites The reviews are mixed so I wanted to play it safe I got the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes sour tasting soft serve and regular ass corn flakes on top I dont understand how this place is still in business with sooo many other choices that actually taste GOOD in Las Vegas Save your money you WILL BE DISAPPOINTED McDonalds soft serve is better than Milk bar,negative,84,75-100,457,<500
The best ice cream shop in all of Arizona The dough melt is the best combination of pastry to ice cream that Ive ever encountered The owneroperator of the shop is also an all around cool human,positive,37,25-50,197,<500
I am a fan of Thomas Kellers and after having purchased his Bouchon bakery book I was pumped to try the treats to see how mine compared We had a horrible time trying to find this place and had I not been so big of a fan I would have just given up BTW it is located in the building with the clock in a small location right by the strip The place is super small and has a little patio outside with a few seats These seats unfortunately were overtaken with a few homeless people and some drunk people sleeping the night off We tried a TLC TKO and the carrot cake cookies The only one that stood out was the carrot cake cookie  the rest were unimpressive I really wanted to love this place but alas I did not,negative,142,100-150,718,500-1000
Adding to the chorus of praise below Mitchells is a Cleveland legendworthy of the highest accolades If you havent been to their storefront or bought their pints at the grocery store before charge ahead full speed and dont hold back This is a splurge Side note when doing your Yelp research ignore the 1star tantrums of those clueless Yelp users who do us no favors by rating a business based on a 5second interaction with a clerk or a perceived slight they felt from the floorsweeper Amongst those of us who actually eat the ice cream Id be willing to bet there is almost a universal 5star consensus On to the product on creaminess alone Mitchells rises above just about any ice cream youll find on store shelves The flavor selection isnt as wild and experimental as some outfits these days but youll find stunningly good versions of your favorite avantgarde ice creams from the 80s and 90s  cookies and cream butter pecan cookie dough pralines and cream etc Youll also find yourself muttering in awe at how well Mitchells is able to extract the flavor from a given ingredient and infuse it into an ice cream creating simple and exquisite classics coconut pistachio coffee smores etc Their pastryinfused ice creams are especially aweinspiring banana cream pie apple pie strawberry rhubarb pie caramel fudge brownie the baked goods they use in these concoctions could win contests on their own What I love about Mitchells is that its not just the tastiest ice cream out there its also the purest When you pick up a pint and read the ingredients you wont see a laundry list of unpronounceable ingredients and stabilizers xanthams guar gumsetc etc Instead youll mainly just see the wholesome and timetested basics that gave ice cream its international fame cream skim milk organic sugar sea salt vanilla egg yolks,positive,312,300- 500,1890,1500-2000
Cool spot for late night ice cream Came around 930pm on a Wednesday night and there were a bit of people coming in still They make all their ice cream right behind their register and you can check them out too on their 2nd floor viewing deck Staff was nice and let you have a few samples Very creamy and a lot of flavor Not too sweet either Great selections of flavors and about 5 vegan options chocolate chocolate hazelnut mango sorbet raspberry sorbet salted caramel praline,positive,87,75-100,489,<500
This place is a Charlotte staple The salted caramel brownies are amazing I ask for one every day on my birthday They also have great breakfast baguette sandwiches and coffeesteas The decorations here are so unique and fun to look at Its a great place to work remotely or have a meeting They also have an event space for bridal showers baby showers etc,positive,64,50-75,362,<500
Very disappointing The quality has gone down hill ever since they got popular Almost every donut in the box this time was dry and stale The famous creme brÃlÃe donut barely had any cream Its especially disappointing since this place is supposed to be top rated I think they need to focus on their product and not their trendy appearance,negative,60,50-75,346,<500
I didnt get the chance to try Milk Bar while I was in NYC so I was excited to get the chance to try it while I was in Vegas I got the famous cereal milk soft serve I was told it tastes just like the milk at the bottom of a bowl of corn flakes but for 6 I was thinking surely theres more to it than that Well theres not It tastes JUST like the leftover milk after you finish eating your corn flakes Dont expect anything more If you dont like sweet desserts  this would be an option for you since theres barely any sweetness to it I decided to add cornflake crunch around my tiny cup of soft serve because it made it look more appealing I mean I asked myself what the perfect topping would be for cereal milk soft serve  obviously the cornflake crunch NOPE Not only was it 1 extra but I thought it was seriously on the salty side Yuck I appreciate the sweet and salty combination I love salted carameland dipping my fries into milkshakes but this combo that Milk Bar put together was a no no in my book My friend got the fruity cereal milk soft serve and I thought that had a pretty nice Fruity Pebbles milk taste Was it 6 good though Granted this review is only based on the cereal milk soft serve so dont let that stop you from trying their other menu items Whats unique and exclusive to the Vegas Milk Bar is they have Milkquakes so maybe give those a try,negative,270,250-300,1402,1000-1500
Awesome ice cream alert I love that Honey Hut makes different flavors throughout the year The seasonal fallwinter flavors are my favorite This place is a hidden gem Just walk up and get whatever ice cream you have a taste for and then grab a seat on the nearest picnic table In the summer this place can get packed They also close during the cold months so get as much ice cream as you can while they are open for the season,positive,82,75-100,432,<500
Omg these donuts are amazing  Get there early so you have a great choice as its first come first serve ,positive,22,<50,106,<500
We shared a BIG massive slice of the birthday cake along with a cup of the cereal milk and chocolate pretzel soft serve covered with their corn flake sprinkles and we devoured every last bite of everything The cake was so good and had the wonderful surprise of having little sugary cookie pieces baked INTO the cake itself unexpected and delicious And the corn flake sprinkles made the whole dessert extra special a textural wonder Loved it Excellent service from Amy super helpful and generous,positive,85,75-100,512,500-1000
Not great  we went here because The PussyCat gelato place was closed holiday We had been to the PussyCat gelato place in Old Towne last night and it was amazing Sorry Fatty Daddys but your gelato is too sweet  like its made from a premade mix Toppings didnt help The skimpy scoop was hollow inside,negative,57,50-75,310,<500

Just stopped by for a snack and I was blown away First the theme is great Second there is such a huge assortment of options to choose from its overwhelming I opted for the spiced chai donut which was 3 and delicious Very flavorful and the actual donut wasnt greasy but instead light and airy We got two coffees which were also on point I will be back especially with the awesome and shaded outdoor area perfect for the Vegas weather,positive,81,75-100,445,<500
You can buy jugs of house made milk tea AND they sell the elusive and glorious Hokkaido Cheese Tart The prices are fantastic and they are taking all precautions very seriously during the pandemic Social distancing special packaging and display Terrific My new goto japanese bakery,positive,46,25-50,288,<500
I drove across town to give this ice cream a try I truly love ice cream and Handels is top notch The sampler which gives you 4 decent size scoops is a great deal at just over 4,positive,38,25-50,181,<500
Im not sure what happened to the Amelies I have known and loved It is not up to the same caliber as it used to be The coffee was bland and served in paper cups instead of a real cup I could see abundance of them on top of the espresso machine Not only that No attempt was given to make it even look good No design My cappuccino was mostly foam I used to love coming here and drove here 20 minutes hoping for a great cup of coffee but was met with disappointment Needless to say I will not even dream of coming back here,negative,107,100-150,532,500-1000
Im not a big fan of ice cream but we both had a cone here last weekend and the ice cream was as good as anything I have had The science fiction wall mural is awesome,positive,36,25-50,168,<500
One of my favorite place to grab pastries and dessert Grab a few pastries and sea salt coffee with boba Tried the aussie pot pie with impossible meat and that for sure was tasty The bread compliments the meat flavor The sea salt coffee with boba was made exactly how I want it Its a straight up coffee no cream beside the foam on top so you can definitely taste the coffee They always have new pastries to try,positive,79,75-100,417,<500
Good ole fashion ice cream They were busy for a Friday and the staff went out of their way to be kind and prompt although they had a large group outside with a big order The parking isnt great and I wish there were more seats outside but the ice cream was perfect,positive,53,50-75,268,<500
They have to have a better update on their store hours on Yelp or website Was there on Friday  4292022  thinking to pick up some pastry and they decided to open at 9 by just sticking a sign up Called the store the lady just simply said we are running behind and sorry about that Which store does that Ridiculous,negative,62,50-75,323,<500
What is up with all the frigging Macaroons Wasnt impressed Big stale overpriced cookie Plus side is I always like a bakery in my hotel when traveling and this one generally didnt have much of a line The people behind the counter werent too quick to offer service or too friendly Maybe they sensed I wasnt succumbing to the Macaroon spell they were attempting to cast,negative,66,50-75,376,<500
After trying what is supposedly the best of the best macaroons Ive finally realized that I dont like them very much at all I always thought that it was because I had not found one that was good Everyone talks about Bouchon like its the all mighty creator of macaroons So I tried it but for me it was all hype I tried every flavor they had available Maybe its the texture that I dont like I expected something that was more crunchy or crispy It just felt like chewed gum in my mouth I am not saying that macaroons are bad in general Im just saying that they are not for me My favorite was the chocolate one however It tasted like a brownie I wished I tried the other desserts The red velvet cupcake was huge twice the size of a regular cupcake and it cost almost as much as one macaroon,negative,154,150-200,810,500-1000
The cake was great however nothing I couldnt get at Grand luxury cafe for less time I gave two stars because we waited 25 minutes because the bakery was so inefficiently run in order to create a line and grab interest That is a fail like When we could have been out inout in 5 minutes,negative,56,50-75,291,<500
Ive been meaning to go here for a while as I had heard from a number of people what incredible donuts they had Unfortunately the location is a bit far for me but the experience was worth it Jack Frost is not a place that would stand out when seen from the road side The stores outer decor likely meets hole in the wall criteria which makes it all the more charming when you walk in and see the plethora of donuts awaiting you A wide variety of donuts were available most frosted and filled in all sorts of manners and every one looked appetizing I had a very hard time picking the dozen donuts I ordered but luckily the kind and patient staff was very willing to help me out with my picks And the donuts themselves were quite tasty soft and sweet albeit perhaps a little overly frosted In the end I was quite satisfied with my trip and if I am in the Parma area in the future I would definitely make a point to stop by again You should to,positive,184,150-200,965,500-1000
I think this place deserves between 3 and 4 stars I really liked Cristinas episode on Chefs Table so we decided to go for a dessert The place is really cute and nicely decorated We had the cereal milk soft serve and a slice of carck pie I really enjoyed the idea of having such an ice cream It truly reminded me to cereal bowls from my childhood Regarding the crack pie I was craving this pie so much that it ended up disappointing me I personally feel it was too sweet buttery and overpriced for such tiny slice,positive,99,75-100,524,500-1000
I have never written a review on yelp but I had to take the time to do this one We were in Phoenix for one night on our way to California and decided to go to Novel for the Dough Melt The customer service was incredible the surroundings wonderful and the ice cream marvelous,positive,54,50-75,280,<500
Not possibly real ice cream Had texture of vegetable oil I do not understand why there are so many great reviews I sampled six flavors and each had a mealy oily texture Went with strawberry cheesecake because i thought how can u mess that one up Nopesame horrible texture,negative,49,25-50,279,<500
Weve been to the San Francisco Ghiradelli and now the Vegas one and theyre both great We went on a Friday evening and the store wasnt crowded at all and there was no line Lots of great options to choose from the smell of chocolate is everywhere Be prepared with a sweet tooth we split a large sundae and couldnt finish Good location and nice service,positive,66,50-75,362,<500
Great large coffee shop and bakery Ample parking and nooks to work Amazingly this place is always packed with long lines but they have line control down to a science It would be nice to have a self service black coffee line but I would assume people would take liberties If you need to kill an hour head here Would be five stars but the coffee is pricey and not very strong All the baked goods are 35 stars depending on your taste,positive,83,75-100,442,<500
So disappointed went to the Venetian last night excited to try some pastrys at Carlos Bake Shop I am a big fan of his show Cake Boss so I was expecting the sugar cookie and chocolate cookie I ordered to taste AMAZINGfirst bite in the cookie crumbled into tiny pieces half in my mouth half on the floor It was so dry that it was more like powdered sugar Total let down,negative,72,50-75,385,<500
The customer service here is shameful I went in yesterday with a friend to finally try their ice cream and after asking for the manager all of the girls working were staring at me and gossiping I sampled the red velvet coffee fudge almond salted caramel and peanut butter cup All of the flavors were under developed and a few didnt taste like the flavor advertised The red velvet ice cream was basically an icy vanilla ice cream with red velvet cake sprinkled on top I was expecting cream cheese ice cream with red velvet cake mixed inside or some type of rendition of a red velvet cupcake The coffee almond fudge ice cream tasted like a very strong coffee with no hint of fudge or almond Salted caramel was the best of the 4 but it was too sweet We didnt want any of the ice cream but the cookies in the display case looked good so we ordered the snickerdoodle cookie Instead of taking the cookie out of the case the girl working took out a prepackaged cookie from below The cookie was hard as a rock and was much smaller than the one in the display case Everything about the cookie was suspicious so I returned the cookie and when I was getting my money back I saw ants crawling on the floor I told the male manager at the register and he says  thanks I know with an attitude If you know why arent the ants being cleaned up off the floor Sprinkles Cupcakes employees are extremely rude and the ice cream is sub par I will never step foot in this location again,negative,279,250-300,1489,1000-1500
They have the best macaroons in town but the virus is messing up my macaroon eating they were closed and open at 5 I always stop after attending the theater next door but they happen to be closed too The bakery is at the entrance to the Grand Lux Restaurant,positive,50,25-50,259,<500
On a Friday night in October the door says cash only which is odd since there is a coin shortage I entered the door and no greeting from the cashier No one was inside at all I love looking at the Ghirardelli chocolates packaged for Xmas I just a small chocolate bar since I borrowed few bucks from my sister The chocolate bar was delicious and hit the spot 2 stars no greeting when entering 4 stars plenty of chocolate to choose,negative,82,75-100,435,<500
What a shame Definitely hasnt lived up to the hype The cupcakes are extremely dense almost bagel like and taste store bought They were barely average Also we bought the blue cake with brown polka dots that is shown on the show quite a bit Just average and kind of chemically in taste On the bright side the cream puffs were amazing Overall it most certainly wasnt worth the hour wait and was way overpriced We live near Retro Bakery in the NW part of town Their cupcakes and cakes are WAY better than CBs desserts,negative,96,75-100,533,500-1000
I will honestly never get Clevelands obsession with Mitchells I would say Graeters and so many other ice creams are much better It just is mind boggling to me why everyone acts like this ice cream is amazing All other locations of Mitchells for me are a solid 3 stars because the ice cream is average Nothing to write home about also not terrible I REALLY do not like their chocolate or vanilla ice creams and when you cant get those right its hard to make a fan out of me However Ive recently tried the shakes and I got a Peanut Butter one at this location and I enjoyed it However I hate that they only have one size of a milkshake It ends up wasting money and food when you only offer one size which would be most other places medium or large Its just too much and I cant even imagine how many calories are in that thing Yikes This location gets a 4 star review from me because it is the flagship location and is a cool place to take outoftowners after a bite to eat or drinks in Ohio City So all told ice cream is a solid 3average This location is fun though and has good efficient service,positive,214,200-250,1127,1000-1500
I go here every week for coffee with friends Its a fun atmosphere good pastries and great service Love the Park Road location,positive,23,<50,131,<500
Hailing from Southern California Im well versed in 85 bakery since their first one opened in Irvine more than ten years ago Came by before I realized they even had their grand opening so I realize theyre still ironing things out However the Hawaiian chicken that I got lacked toppings Their cakes however are on point I didnt give them five stars due to the poor customer service I understand that theyre still in soft opening phase but the drink I received was wrong from the one I orderedreflected on my receipt When I pointed it out the man serving drinks tried to lie and say that they only charged me for the regular mountain green tea when I was clearly charged 345 for the sea salt mountain green tea Additionally it listed SSALT MT instead of apologizing he took my drink and just added sea salt on top despite it being already cold so the consistency wont be right Its supposed to be milk teaesque and mix when its hot so I was very disappointed I saw that they were very busy so I didnt push the issue further but its something they can work on apologizing to the customer when theyve made a mistake,negative,206,200-250,1142,1000-1500
This place is a landmark in CU Not too expensive great variety comforting ambiance If youre not a local you will still get those nostalgic feelings when you stop by here A,positive,32,25-50,179,<500
My family and I have tried many of their bakery items In my opinion stay away from the floured cakes cupcakes dry as a bone better cupcakes at walmart cookies and donuts Go for the italian and any of the custard filled pastries such as the Lobster tail and Napoleons with the powdered sugar and the cannolis Cheesecakes are OK Also anything with whip cream Those are the pastires where they shine They discontinued one of the items I like the cannoli cake tower Maybe I was the only one buying it Overall this place satisfies our longing for the italian baked goods in NYC Little Italy where we all moved from such as Ferraras Has been hard to find decent italian pastries out here in the west coast This one comes close Have never been to the Carlos in NYC because I never heard of it Maybe it didnt exist back then But it would be hard to beat the italian bakeries in my neighborhood,positive,166,150-200,920,500-1000
We drove here for dessert after dinner The place is a little hidden and has some weird parking LOL The guy who worked there was super nice He allowed us to try ice cream and wasnt rushing us at all I got the coffee ice cream with the vanilla macaron and marshmallow on top Delicious He gave us a pretty huge amount The decor was simple but there was room to sit and chat Liked this place a lot Should give it a try,positive,84,75-100,427,<500
Love the breakfast sandwich with egg spinach mushrooms and cheese Of course you cant go wrong with any of the pastries I personally love the fruit tarts In the summer the passion fruit lemonade is amazing,positive,36,25-50,213,<500

Sprinkles is officially open I was able to go to their sneak peek this past Wednesday as someones guest and we were able to get four free cupcakes and two free scoops of ice cream The outside of Sprinkles is so cute and I love that a Cupcake ATM exists I definitely plan to make my way there during after hours for cupcakes Just take my money The inside of Sprinkles is just as cute and I love that its stated on the wall by the cupcake area that they donate to local charities and food banks Go you Sprinkles I got vanilla bean and salty caramel for ice cream flavors They were both really good though I had to cut the salty caramel bite with a vanilla bean bite to balance it out but I knew that ahead of time which is why I got both flavors The cupcakes I got were vanilla milk chocolate peanut butter chocolate chocolate marshmallow and cinnamon sugar With each bite I took I was in cupcake heaven I think chocolate marshmallow is my favorite of the four but I think Ill have to repeat this experiment further You know for science Tip Double check what cupcake or ice cream flavors are available because not every flavor is available every day As an example orange cupcake is only available on Tuesdays,positive,227,200-250,1235,1000-1500
The texture was good but the taste was absolutely TERRIBLE We tried four different flavors and all of them had a horrible metallic taste to them throughout every single bite Ended up throwing them out such a waste of money Unless you enjoy the taste of licking a metal pan I highly recommend saving your money and heading to an ice cream shop where they have food handling standards  customer service skills The owner of the place is who served us she handled the money with her bare hands  then scooped our ice cream without washing her hands or putting on gloves MAJOR HEALTH CODE VIOLATION If thats how the owner is handling the food she serves then I have zero confidence that she trained her staff to have proper food handling skills Nothing worse than leaving a place feeling ripped off and wondering what else those dirty hands touched before handling your food Another review stated that the customer found pieces of plastic in their ice cream definitely wish I had read the reviews before subjecting myself  my children to this place,negative,186,150-200,1064,1000-1500
I went here after a friend recommended it to me Her being an ice cream lover had tried an exorbitant amount of places one summer trying to find the best ice cream in Arizona and after trying it I agree that this is the best ice cream shop in Arizona or at least within the Phoenix metropolitan area Their butter pecan is absolutely amazing,positive,64,50-75,347,<500
Bouchon Bakery is a classic tourist trap in the Venetian on the Vegas Strip I came to Bouchon Bakery one other time a year or two ago and the experience was so forgettable that I dont remember what I ordered or ate This time they wont be so lucky I ordered a ham and cheese croissant 694 and requested it warm Their version of warming up a croissant sandwich is apparently putting it in the microwave without actually turning the microwave on Whatever treatment they gave it resulted in a smooshy and sadlooking croissant but one with a decidedly cold filling The ham was of the normal sliced deli variety Despite being billed as containing dijon mustard I couldnt taste any mustard My eagerlyanticipated croissant ended up being nothing more than an unfortunate waste of emmenthaler cheese and a waste of 7 I would have had a more satisfying croissant sandwich at Dunkin Donuts I also ordered the kouign amann 416 which was not as bad but also no better than the kouign amanns I get at bakerychain Paris Baguette in San Diego for half the price Rather than being rich and buttery with a cakelike consistency Bouchons kouign amann simply tastes and feels like a large croissant with a caramelized top or bottom depending on how you plate your kouign amanns My pastries were accompanied by an iced latte 532 that was poorly conceived and negligently put together with my syrup of choice fully sinking to the bottom of the cup before I could even take my first sip Middling chains from Starbucks to Panera Bread to Coffee Bean have solved for this by using thinner more soluble syrups why cant Bouchon Bakery Anyway Shame on you Chef Keller Understand that when you put your name on an establishment that serves food your customers reasonably expect that establishment to represent your culinary ideals and perspective regardless of whether or not youre directly overseeing the operation or engineering the menu Your name has value and people are willing to pay extra for that given your wellearned reputation I have to believe that if one of your pastry chefs ever tried to serve anything of the quality Ive had at Bouchon Bakery to your customers at French Laundry or Per Se youd fire him or her immediately for gross incompetence Do the right thing and put this abomination of a bakery out of its misery  your reputation is at stake FoodDÃcorService 1233NA,negative,412,300- 500,2438,2000+
My daughter and I were big fans of Cake Boss and were excited to try this Las Vegas iteration Buried deep within the Venetian it wasnt easy to find but thanks to some kind hotel staff along the way we were finally able to locate the bakery across from Buddy Vs namesake restaurant The Good  Friendly and knowledgable staff  Gorgeouslooking cakes and pastries  Good coffee Had an iced black Americano that was spoton The Not So Good  No place to sit inside the bakery  Pricey 3200 for four pastries and a small coffee  Quality was lacking All four pastries looked legit but were all very dry My daughter loves cupcakes and her peanut butter cupcake in particular was undersized and as dry as the Sahara Weve had supermarket cupcakes that were far superior I had the coffee cake and though it tasted okay again the cake itself was so dry and hard that we snapped the plastic knife trying to cut it into shareable pieces I wish we could recommend this place but unfortunately at these prices and at this level of quality Carlos Bakery Las Vegas gets a hard pass from us,negative,199,150-200,1102,1000-1500
Honestly Im a fan of the next great baker And Ive been wanting to try Carlos Bakery for the longest So today it finally happened and I dont understand what the hype is On the show Buddy was very big on the importance of the sponge in a cakecupcake It should be moist soft and delightful Me my mom my brother and his girlfriend all bought one and tried it together and both cupcakes the red velvet and the carrot cake were dry We tried a Canoli which was good and the Lobster tail was good as well but nothing was amazing The service was good but the desserts were a disappointment Not to mention the desserts were pretty pricey so yea Im not coming back,negative,126,100-150,682,500-1000
You know I really want to give these guys the benefit of the doubt but I can not even begin to describe how severely overrated this place is I went in with high expectations considering the fact that it has nearly 500 reviews and a 4star rating but I was extremely let down My chocolate hazelnut ice cream was very underwhelming the macaroon tasted cheap the cardboard type of macaroon not the yummy rich macaroon I was expecting It was thin and tasted like grocery store candy It didnt look anything like the macaroons in the photos Truly the people who have given this 4 or 5 stars do not know GOOD ice cream The ice cream didnt even taste like it was made with quality ingredients it was the same ice cream I could have bought in a store for a lot cheaper Nothing special at all The concept was really unique but the location ambiance price and quality of the actual product did not impress me in the slightest The only good thing about this place was the friendly staff I would not recommend this place to anyone,negative,190,150-200,1046,1000-1500
Not happy  Always get to order a special pie for next day pick up today the staff was rude they didnt even ask if they could just said no they dont do it,negative,34,25-50,158,<500
Not knocking them on their food cause its not that bad of a bakery but the service is terrible I orderered a cake and in the instructions it says to go straight to the pick up which I did every associate from the cashier to whoever was making the drinks didnt once even acknowledge me just standing there I stood in line until someone helped me and they didnt even have my order ready at the specific time and even made it seem like I didnt order at all I showed them the reciept and whoever was looking into my order was acting clueless and didnt move with a purpose At the end of the day terrible service,negative,118,100-150,622,500-1000
The ice cream is great and they offer a lot choices The marshmallows are the best I like how they sell them too I plan on buying marshmallows once hot chocolate season is here This was a good place to bring our young family The kids sat at a little table and we played Connect Four and other board game that is provided here I hope they open a closer store but it was worth the drive,positive,77,75-100,392,<500
Love My favorite ice cream ever  Ill never eat ice cream from the store or anyplace else ever again Lots of great flavors All the ones I have tired so far Strawberry cheesecake chunk Chocolate Strawberry Mint chocolate chip and my very favorite Deep dish apple pie AMAZING Staff is great to Oh so very patient  A Big Thanks to the genius guy that brought Handels to Vegas ,positive,71,50-75,387,<500
Their tarts are fantastic but the true measure of a french cafe are the Eclairs they put there stamp on them for crying out loud Ive been to everyone location and the pate a choux was overcooked or BURNT every time Im in the industry I get it you forget the last tray or the ovens too hot the first batch but you DONT serve those There is literally a waste sheet for that Worse than burnt product is the apathy served by the staff when you draw their attention to the problem When a customer points out a flaw in service FIX it I will not be back til they do,negative,112,100-150,573,500-1000
Amazing sweet treats and the service was fast and friendly First time here and could not be more satisfied There are a lot of sorbet options and the flavors are true to their name Must try the coconut and limebasil sorbet,positive,41,25-50,226,<500
Great slice of life bakery in the heart of Little Italy Stopped in midafternoon after visiting the art museum The place was still bustling but the counter staff were all very pleasant It was an impossibly tempting set of choices but I went with the Napoleon and a cafe au lait Despite a little bargaining with myself in the direction of restraint I pretty much devoured the pastry It was wonderful and a little unusual compared to other Napoleons Ive sampled and yes I know I had a French pastry in an Italian bakery My tummy knows no borders But at any rate the pastry layers were light and flavorful The interesting thing is that the creme pÃtissiÃre was a rather substantial custardy layer not especially elegant but very delicious It gave me the strength to walk up from Murray Hill back into my home turf in Coventry A mustvisit in Little Italy,positive,153,150-200,875,500-1000
Mid at best Overpriced and overhyped The limited edition cereal crunch cake was extremely dry small serving for 13 a slice The cost is not the issue Its the quality correlating that The cookies are okay but they tasted just like any other store bought cookie Processed and packaged We also got the sundae and shakes because we wanted to experience the milk bar menu they were also mediocre To me its Not worth the  We just expected a more elevated experience for over a hundred dollars of designer treats thats all lol,negative,94,75-100,539,500-1000

Cool spot for late night ice cream I received my birthday cake from here Im not fond of chocolate but i loved my chocolate ice cream cake And the lingering essence of warm waffle cones in the air once you get there can have me sit there all day,positive,49,25-50,248,<500

Its very unfortunate that I need to change my review but after my recent experience I wont be returning I was online about to order like Ive done so many times in the past year when the lady behind the counter  Sunday morning started yelling at me telling me I had to change my mask to one the store provided or leave She tried to humiliate me and embarrass herself in front a a dozen customers I dont support businesses which treat the customers badly so I left What the lady assumed was that I was wearing a mesh mask when in fact the mask I was wearing had a cotton layer inside The mesh was just on the outside A little less aggression and a little more compassion and understanding towards humans at a time like this wouldve gone a long way The lady was repeatedly yelling at me Telling me I needed to wear a cloth mask She then told me to go to front door as they provided masks Except the masks they provide are PAPER She clearing doesnt know the difference between cloth and paper From reading other reviews it seems that 8 employee have caught covid and the manager apparently plays back the store videos to monitor the employees but this is no way to treat the very customers providing you a living I will NEVER give this place my business again,negative,238,200-250,1281,1000-1500
Amelies is so an eccentric atmosphere with impeccable savory sweet Macaroons are my fave but your honestly cant go wrong Its opened 247 so if you need table to work from 2430 pm and again after like 9 pm except on weekends that party and pastry line doesnt die down until like 2 am but it a great place to put all AllNighter I know that was my goto spot until I graduate nursing school Cool ambiance  check Tasty treats  check Great lattes and coffee  check And if you got really hungry their sandwiches are a big fat  check,positive,103,100-150,552,500-1000

I have been to Carlos bakery before and the line was a bit long but I didnt care because I was excited to try it I got the lobster tail and it was good I recently went back again on November 1st and they was no line at all The staff was there but no one would help me After standing there for at least 5 mins I ask the girl do I order here or at the register she said someone will be with you in a bit Really I was the only one there So I waited and they finally helped me I ordered my items then she said someone will ring you up in a bit I waited and waited until a guy went to the register never made eye contact and blurred out the total twice I said oh is that my total I didnt know you were helping me Very rude staff and unprofessional The baked goods were not worth the wait nor the treatment,negative,170,150-200,819,500-1000

I love this restaurant I am a pastry chef and came across this spot as it is near my home in the fun area of NODA and just fell in love I loved the decor the product selection the beautiful case with all the goodies they have great teas and fruit drinks plus the lighting is very special and artistic I have tried many things here from the crunchy buttery croissants the mini fruit tarts and I have had them all the mini tea cakes chocolate tarts i always purchase macaroons in many flavors the colors and selection is wide and exciting They have meal options from fresh creative salads to what they call Tartines that are open faced sandwiches and my FAVORITE is the Fig with Bacon and Brie I cant tell you how many times I have ordered the full order and ate the whole thing in one sitting Every time I go I enjoy what I order and always try a new item from their case The only issue for me is if you do not hit this spot at the right time the line can be 20 or more deep while they do have a decent sized staff it is not enough to always handle the long line But you do get in and out with good service great food and many things to look at They have seating indoor and outside and offer all ToGo and the containers are well thought out and your food gets home safe and sound and tastes great I would recommend this restaurant to anyone that is not watching their calories loves pastry loves sweets and wants to try some new fun tastes and flavors Again this is a popular spot and there are a couple locations to check out A new one is coming soon and they are calling it their Flagship shop cant wait to check it out,positive,320,300- 500,1648,1500-2000

Only thing is ice cream is good for is pictures If you care about taste I wouldnt come here I dont know how this place has good reviews unless the people who tasted this ice cream came here during the pandemic and didnt realize they lost their taste yet Drove 15 minutes here and was so disappointed Ice cream taste like someone went to the dollar store bought the cheapest vanilla ice cream they could find added a bunch of unnecessary food colorings which gave the ice cream a metal aftertaste and dumped a bunch of sugar in it Taste like something I would give a bunch of two year olds at a kids birthday party but thats only if I didnt like the kids But I love kids so I would never do that Im the type of person where even if I dont like my food Ill finish it so it wont go to waste but I happily threw it out after the second bite,negative,167,150-200,854,500-1000

Okay I get it its a place from tv But to be honest this place isnt that amazing First off the lady who took my order shorted me on not one but two things And it took her 5xs as long as any other person to pack it They need someone too double check the orders before they send it out I mean come on they pretty much stole 10 from us,negative,72,50-75,344,<500
Service was excellent and I was intrigued by the Crack Pie flavor seeing that our local Milk Bar does not serve that Server was also helpful by offering a larger container to prevent spillage,positive,34,25-50,194,<500
So delicious Many great flavors High quality ice cream Mitchells might be the best place to get ice cream,positive,19,<50,110,<500
This ice cream is delicious Its super creamy  the flavors are something special Today I had a donut melt donut ice cream sandwich with half  half honey lavender  London fog latte Honey lavender tasted like a sweet cream honey with a hint of lavender London fog latte tasted like earl Grey tea with cream  sugar Stuffed inside a large glazed  holeless donut this was an incredible treat Price 550,positive,74,50-75,415,<500
Honey Hut is simply the best This place has the best honey pecan Order scoops with a waffle cone and absorb the frozen nectar of the gods True story I once had a dream that Jesus and I went to the Honey Hut after we ordered everyone followed us down the brick road street starting at the corner Amazing This place is great for milkshakes too Truly a cant miss opportunity for you This place is very good and therefore a common sighting place for obese Clevelanders in perspired tanktops Doesnt bother me at all its that good I am filled with peace after I eat the ice cream We can talk philosophy at the picnic table and have a great time I miss you lets go get some ice cream,positive,131,100-150,695,500-1000
Stale cupcakes with mediocre chocolate frosting Biscotti is better from the Costco tub Staff that was more interested in yaking with each other than providing service Growing up in Philly with plenty of Italian bakerys  Got me once not again,negative,41,25-50,248,<500
I came in for a cannoli but when I saw all of the choices I opted for raspberry mousse So light and airy I also bought an iced coffee Its a busy place Make sure you grab a number as soon as you walk in and start making your decision so you can keep things moving,positive,56,50-75,269,<500
This place is amazing Definitely a unique dessert option We had a pineapplestrawberry ice cream cup with a strawberry macaroon and toasted marshmallow Soooo good Well be coming back often,positive,30,25-50,194,<500
No complaints about the food and the coffee is super strong but the service there blows We stayed at the Venetian and went there twice each morning and it seemed like chaos every time My friend waited a good 20 minutes for her grilled cheese sandwich and everyone was confused about the status of it The next time I ordered a coffee with room and the shortthin young girl who works there was so rude to me when i asked a question and refused to give me an answer My friends who were standing behind me thought I was going to blow a fuse on her based on the attitude I received but I decided to keep my composure this time I witnessed the staff making numerous mistakes with peoples orders and I waited 10 minutes to get two Splendas for my coffee Considering how busy this place gets there should be more people working there I also wish they had some sitting instead of having to walk to the food court to sit down,negative,175,150-200,925,500-1000
ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT Will always go to this place Not close to it anymore but would still recommend it,positive,19,<50,102,<500
Everytime I go its super delicious I advise if you are a fan of bananas or Captain Crunch ice cream to get those scooped together and enjoy the ice cream form of cereal and bananas Its incredible Customer service is great too,positive,42,25-50,230,<500
On our latest trip to Vegas we stayed at the Cosmo and conveniently took the elevator down to Milk Bar one afternoon I only had one mission for this place and that was to try something with the Cereal Milk I ended up getting Cereal Milk Soft Serve with Corn Flakes as a toppingand WOW it really does taste like Cereal Milk I liked it because it wasnt too sweet and the texture was light and creamy We also tried some of the cookies that turned out to be great gifts to bring home They are a bit inconsistent though as my sister said that sometimes when she gets the Corn Cookie its not as good as when they buy the mix and bake them themselves I did like our batch though since it was nice and soft and I personally prefer soft cookies over crispy It was just a tad underdone though Overall really enjoyed this place and cant wait to come back and try more,positive,167,150-200,883,500-1000
We are visiting Las Vegas and we were so excited to try the legendary treats of Carlos bakery But our hopes were crushed along with the cannolis that were out for a week because they ran out of the ingredients We still stayed in the half hour line to at least try the cakes that people like so much But after we made it through the conflict of the employees trying to make us us buy more of everything we ended with this Cannoli tower Stale dry and flavorless The only good part was the cannoli cream in the center Red Velvet cake Dry flavorless and tasted nothing like red velvet After trying this food we were full of sugar We then decided to get some coffee to settle our stomachs We waited in the line again to order It was finally our turn We ordered small coffees but they were out of small cups So they told us they could only sell us large cups of coffee until we suggested that they could just fill a large cup up halfway All in all the only good treats were the chocolate strawberries In my opinion skip the Las Vegas version and try the one in Hoboken Maybe that one lives up to the tv show Even their cakes which are so famous and creative on TV in Las Vegas they look like they came straight from a local grocery store but three times the price Disappointed,negative,246,200-250,1308,1000-1500
This place is absolutely terrible I can not believe that Im actually finding great reviews on this place Way over priced I got a milkshake from there and the consistency of the shake was like water Also the milk tasted sour in it I will never go back to this place 0stars,negative,52,50-75,279,<500
They have good ice cream but I m really worried about the hygiene there Even during pandemic they were not wearing mask all the time not to mention they touch money and than they dont put on gloves when they make your ice cream or if they do they dont change them Also there were some employees in the past that were super rude and try to over charge me Too bad,negative,72,50-75,366,<500
Im not a huge donut fan but Donut Bars funky treats are hard to turn down their DTLV location and availabletilsoldout hours make an actual visit fairly rare for me but Ive come across their donuts at various events and on appreciation tables at work pretty regularly Ive enjoyed the Salted Caramel Mexican Hot Chocolate Blood Orange and Creme Brulee donuts while the Big Poppa Tart makes a good one to share huge and stuffed with an actual Pop Tart and likely several days worth of sugar I tried the Matcha on a recent visit and it was okay small and not too sweet but the Strawberry Split has my heart fresh fruit whipped cream photogenic and shareable Eventually I need to go back for the Caramel Latte donut and their Grilled Cheese TIP Go early and check their online menu to be sure they have what you want selection varies daily,positive,152,150-200,860,500-1000
Simply the best ice cream youll ever have The tall kid that works there the tall guy that looks like Sideshow Bob is an awesome worker,positive,26,25-50,139,<500
The deserts are really good We really love to get the macarons when we go there It is really awesome that they have a wide array of flavors and they rotate out so you get something new everytime The place is usually busy so there is a bit of a wait in line but it is worth it in my opinion,positive,61,50-75,294,<500
So I was so excited to go try some things from Milk bar after watching a show about the pastry chef behind the restaurant The crack pie was small and nothing special The cookies were prepackaged and I was expecting fresh cookies based on all the hype over the milk bar Not much of a big deal they can still be good I thought NO I was wrong the cookies were hard and stale I feel like they couldve been good had they been fresh It tasted like a cookie that had been left on the counter for a week Literally worst cookie Ive ever had hands down Birthday cake truffles were okay too gooey but not bad The service was good The people working their were super great I didnt eat my treats until I got back to my condo or else I wouldve asked what the deal was Oh well save your money and find treats elsewhere,negative,159,150-200,829,500-1000
This is a quintessential weekend or weekday spot Bright and airy this spot lends itself to lazy mornings or energetic afternoons It is the type of place you want to sit and stay whether alone or with friends I arrived with a group of nine on a Sunday morning and we were served efficiently The display case is nothing short of stunning filled with luscious pastries and treats The specialty salted caramel brownie did not disappoint Others in my group ordered macarons sandwiches and coffees and there was not a single complaint Im sure everyone can relate to how hard it is to please a large group Would definitely recommend this as a stop to both residents and visitors to Charlotte,positive,121,100-150,698,500-1000
Get the macaroons and the peanut butter cookies This is also a great place for some coffee Ive been to the original in Napa and this little stand maintains the same quality Trust me get the macaroons theyre worth the 3 price tag,positive,43,25-50,242,<500
Best homemade ice cream in Vegas The black cherry is amazing Heck try them all you wont be disappointed,positive,19,<50,108,<500
It was ok only a couple of toppings to choose from and the flavors were nothing to write home about Not worth the 15 minute drive Staff were nice though,negative,30,25-50,158,<500
I have enjoyed my experience here you get a whole lot of ice cream for your  the service is fast and friendly the ice cream was great and they gave out free samples which is always appreciated because if you have kids you know they can never decide When in the Madison area this is a great place to stop for ice cream,positive,64,50-75,320,<500
Its a huge rip off And to top it off the cashier was totally unfair There was a special being offered where if you buy 2495 you get an apron We bought about 65 worth and she didnt want to split the check between me and my mother in law so we could get 2 aprons even though we both paid for it But she had just done it to a customer ahead of us,negative,75,50-75,358,<500
Jenis ice cream is awesome but the service we received on Tuesday was horrible Why close at 11 if the three staff members you have scheduled are complaining about having guests walk in at 1010 PM They made it obvious they were unhappy about us walking in 50 mins til 11 They even mumbled bruh are they serious I work in the service industry as well and I would never allow staff members to treat guests this way The first guest is as important as the last,negative,87,75-100,466,<500
One of the best ice cream places in the valley My favorite is a pretzel cone with peanut butter ice cream and some salted Caramel Their sundaes are really delicious and filling The only downside to this place is their floats dont have enough ice cream and the soda always seems warm so it melts it too fast The left over soda in the bottle because it is warm you dont really feel like drinking the rest of it,positive,79,75-100,417,<500
There was only few donuts to select through and it was just basic donuts This was my first time going and will be my last time going No high chairs in there for my baby Stay away from this place This is not a donut bar with only 3 choices to choose from,negative,53,50-75,258,<500
If you like  Sugar Sugar Sugar and Slow as Molasses out of the Freezer Then you will like Carlos My husband and I finally on the third try during our stay in Las Vegas got to order at Carlos and I have to say if you like sugar then you will like Carlos but it is NOT worth the wait We actually took a number went to lunch at Soago walked back and still had three people in front of us 1 hour and 40 minute wait for a bakery The butter cookies 1695pound were good the biscotti 2250pound average had much better at Pizzeria Mozza to Go in West Hollywood and the lobster tail 595  croissantlike dessert with creamfrosting filling  tasty probably 800 1000 calories The carrot cake cupcake 350 pretty to look at just a but dry  skip the cupcakes Maybe try the frosting covered brownie The best was the triplechocolate meringue 350  melted in your mouth Anyway grab a  go for a walk 12 and come back with coffee and a good book The usual wait time us 3075 minutes BTW  once you get waited on the servers could not be more helpful and polite,negative,205,200-250,1099,1000-1500
Oh my  sweets galore The hardest part of shopping here is finding a place to park but its worth it Truffles tubs of egg free cookie dough chocolate covered Oreos and chocolate dipped bacon and huge gourmet cupcakes There are so many options Everything we tried was fresh and delicious The store was clean and well laid out though small for the large line out the door when we arrived The lady working recommended that we call ahead if we desired with large orders so that they would be ready upon arrival although that would prevent us from buying just one more thing to try ,positive,107,100-150,604,500-1000
I heard about this place on the Food Network which highly recommends the Toffee Binoffi Sundae Instead of getting the TB Sundae I chose the oatmeal chocolate chip walnut cookie with 12 scoop of brown butter ice cream  12 scoop almond butter crunch Good combination The only downfall was the cookie tasted really salty Other than that it was good  I would try this place again,positive,68,50-75,390,<500
Delicious ice cream I had a scoop of coconut and birthday cake with rainbow sprinkles of course Service was great They were quick and super patient even with a line out the door Will be back soon,positive,37,25-50,203,<500
I am sure that the pastries must be good but when they dont observe their advertised hours one might never know I planned the dinner assuming desert at the famed Bouchon Bakery on Tuesday night I arrived at 750 pm try advertise a 9 pm closing They were closed and informed me that it had been a slow night so they closed early They lost me forever Dont count on them being open during their advertised hours POOR FORM,negative,79,75-100,429,<500
Coffee was good I had a cafe au lait so I cant judge too harshly The food selection is awesome I was a big fan of the gluten free selection The gf tea cakes were great for breakfast with coffee and I took a couple macarons to go The macaron texture a little airy need to be tapped on the cookie sheet before baking and they are heavy handed on the dye but nice and flavorful Atmospherically speaking this place was fabulous The decor is lovely and charming at 5am it was quiet but I would imagine this would prove the perfect place to chat or work from especially because it is open 247 The girls at the counter were pleasant and helpful with all the gluten free questions If I wasnt from out of town I would definitely come here again,positive,142,100-150,759,500-1000
Such wonderful ice cream The texture is joyously creamy and the flavors are rich and encompass the standards and many creative ones  like orange blossom outstanding and honey graham  all at excellent prices The staff is patient and friendly Theres plenty of outdoor seating theres no indoor seating as this is a large ice cream stand but much of the seating is under an awning My only complaint is that oddly  although like other places Ive seen around Cleveland  it looks like only a few flavors can be used for milkshakes and I keep forgetting to ask why that is which is too bad as many of the other flavors would make incredible milkshakes,positive,118,100-150,668,500-1000
Its pretty good ice cream but they just raised their prices for 425 for a single scoop and 825 FOR 2 SCOOPS OF ICE CREAM lolol like its pretty good but definitely not that good The flavors are interesting but not worth that much,negative,44,25-50,236,<500
Get the cookies and cream warm gooey cookie and then me later The fruity pebbles milkshake was fire too,positive,19,<50,107,<500
Would have given no star but one star is the lowest star possiblehave to be honest worst cupcakes I have ever had and Ive had a wholelota bad cupcakesfrosting had no flavor not even sure they used butter or sugar and cake was beyond dry and again with zero flavorits sad they are stealing peoples money by selling horrible cupcakes,negative,60,50-75,347,<500
By far my favorite local ice cream shop Its a small place and there is usually a line but it is worth it My favorite flavor is the Sweet Cream which they dont have on display The atmosphere is great and the customer service has always been good too,positive,49,25-50,258,<500
Stopped in after waiting so long dietary restrictions to finally try I did some menu research ahead of time and was excited On the evening of my first visit I encountered a short line But hey its a small cozy shop and it is good so expect a little line on your visit The ice cream selection rotates but they keep their most popular around They let you try all the flavors you want On this visit I had lavender honey ice cream with fruity pebbles in the donut as well as a float with their pistachio ice cream combined with a cream soda from thier house curated soda selection Treats in hand I sat out on the shared patio at 3rd Space and enjoyed the evening,positive,127,100-150,669,500-1000
My Oh My Candace Nelson is a confectionary GENIUS sent from Bakers Heaven While heading to the High Roller we could not pass up Sprinkles Can I just say I am glad we did My husband and I love to try new things and we didnt just want a typical cupcake The cashier was very knowledgeable about the different flavors of cupcakes that were displayed because of course curiosity kills the cat and I wanted to know about this and that Finally after asking multiple questions I took the cashiers recommendation and gave the Black  White Cupcake a shot So glad I did My husband and I were able to enjoy this sweet treat while riding the High Roller The cupcake had the sweet taste to perfection It wasnt over powering in one flavor It was very moist and light The icing was also very decadent I will definitely be giving the Sprinkles in my hometown Houston a visit soon Please try Sprinkles for your sweet tooth needs ,positive,170,150-200,944,500-1000
This is the worst cake for its price that I have ever tasted My sister bought the cake for my birthday I felt my birthday got ruined with this stupid cake Just sweet thats all La bonita cake are way better This pricey cake is just like a 9 cake,negative,50,25-50,251,<500
Store was a bit dirty and unorganized When you walk in there wasnt anything that really stood out or was impressive I got to sample one of the edible cookie doughs which Im glad I did because I was originally intending on buying some Maybe its because I was expecting it to be refrigerated but the texture was a bit chalky I ended up buying a chocolate covered pretzel which surprisingly cost 5 A little high but ok What really turned it into a negative experience was the hair that was in the chocolate as pictured Needless to say I ended up just throwing the rest of it away after that,negative,111,100-150,600,500-1000
We love to stop at Pages They have a huge selection and prices are good Staff is always very friendly Its a Pittsburgh tradition,positive,24,<50,136,<500
If you watched Cake Boss Carlos Bakery would most likely be on your Vegas bucket list However do not believe the hype people It is a traditional Americanstyle bakery Nothing hip nor interesting about the items they carry We also sampled some of the caked and they tasted average We still got some pastries togo to use up our resort credit and left unimpressed The good  their assortment of biscotti The mediocre pretty much everything else,negative,77,75-100,455,<500
The sweet treats were great The lady working during St Patricks day around 1 was absolutely fantastic Worth a stop,positive,20,<50,119,<500

I have driven by this ice cream shop tons of times all year I finally decided to go check it out on a chill sunday evening I parked and saw a long lone so I figured that was a good sign it must be good There is a ton of unique dun flavors of ice cream but I decided on just getting a single scoop cake cone 4  my guest got a hot fudge sundae w whipped cream n a cherry on top bday cake  coolie dough ice cream The single scoop was pretty bigI am not really a desert person and it was a lot for me I want to try the 4 scoop sampler next time 455 Friendly staff and they all wore masks for covid safety measures I will be back next time I have a sweet craving Great flavored ice cream and big portions for the prices,positive,153,150-200,739,500-1000
Me and my family stopped by Jennys Ice Cream the day before Thanksgiving for some desert after we ate lunch at Optimist Hall Upon arriving we were greeted warmly by the employees who were very patient with us while we were ordering as we couldnt quite make up our minds This is my wifes favorite ice cream shop and I definitely see why she loves this place I ordered the cookiesncream and I dont know exactly how they make their ice cream but it was well worth it COVID has made it difficult for me to do reviews since I normally love the experience of going to the actual restaurant and meeting the staff and Jennys gave me a good since of normalcy I really enjoyed my time there and the ice cream was very delicious Definitely made a new fan,positive,141,100-150,757,500-1000

Before going I assumed this place would be overrated but I was so wrong Its a great mix of classic and inventive flavors Im not a goat cheese fan but I have gotten the goat cheese with red cherries several times Also do not sleep on the waffle cones  SO worth it The line looks crazy long most days but moves fast Jenis resparked my love of ice cream and continues to change the game while still perfecting classics,positive,80,75-100,428,<500
Went here this afternoon Sunday 92318 because I was craving some homemade chocolate ice cream I have been to this location before and really enjoyed the ice cream and I enjoyed it again today What I didnt enjoy is the bad attitude from the boy at the service window From the get go he had an attitude and I could tell he just doesnt like his job His overall attitude was just blah There was no hello nothing just basically what do you want Asked for it to go and when he gave it to me with a spoon and no lid I asked if I could have a lid and he threw the spoon out and slammed a lid on the cup then slid it through the window and said here it is TO GO Sarcastic much I gave him the money he gave me the change then closed the window didnt say thank you bye see you next time nothing Sorry if you were having a bad day as we all have them sometimes but leave it at home and dont take it out on the people that come there Probably wont be back as there are ice cream shops all around and ones where I can get good ice cream without the attitude of young workers,negative,219,200-250,1089,1000-1500

The food is delicious however Spent about 75 on cookies and cannolis and the cannolis were not filled in the center Ive been eating cannolis all of my life and this typically only happens at a grocery store not a nice bakery I called the bakery to make a complaint and spoke directly to the owner She was sharp and accusatory like I was trying to scam her out of cannolis She asked question after question and gave excuses instead of taking the feedback She told me she would send me a check or replace the cannolis but she was so nasty I just told her to keep it Really sad not to be going to my favorite bakery but customer service is everything,negative,124,100-150,664,500-1000

My wife saw a story on TV about Amelies and suddenly we had to go So we took a field trip from Ballantyne to NoDa to check it out For a French bakery its pretty lame when I can say WilliamsSonoma frozen chocolate croissants are night and day better than Amelies We got a chocolate and cream cheese croissant and while they were both tasty they were spongy and not flaky ie they lacked the actual appeal of a croissant The cream cheese puff was also very tasty but chewy as if it was a day old or older For a place thats open 24 hours youd think they have fresher pastries in the case We really wanted to like Amelies but we will probably never go back unless we have other business to tend to in NoDa,negative,138,100-150,728,500-1000
If it is after 8am AVOID the food After a long day of walking around we were looking forward to grabbing a nice cup of coffee and some pastries around 3 pm Grabbed pastries Butter croissant sticky bun and one of the giant macarons Took bites of said pastries Disgusted by dryness and staleness Proceeded to feel very sad and disappointed Why bother having the bouchon trademark and serve stale goods Talked with girl who sold us pastries  after some discussion she refunded the order at least there was that So lets start with what was wrong 1 For having the dryest butter croissant It looked soo good and flaky But darn can looks be deceiving 1 For having the morning sticky bun that was made two mornings ago They claimed these were baked fresh but ive made sticky buns myself and they didnt taste that stale the butter in the caramel had almost a rancid taste even after days in the fridge 1 For macaron that was frozen not properly thawed and then produced to ice while still being icecold The worker claimed they were Refrigerated Unless in the cooking world 8C is refrigeration something is wrong 1 For the kind soul that refunded us the money She seemed so lost and claimed thats how everything is supposed to taste Not sure if thats better or worse Anywho I dont even want to give them a second shot sadness,negative,241,200-250,1378,1000-1500
Im going to start this off by saying this is my temporary review of Donut Bar Its October 2nd 2019 and after an accidental overcharge this morning Ill be visiting again several weeks from now for some complimentary donuts per the owner and employee named Olivia I basically only review donut shops I literally start most days with a donut and coffee typically a maple bacon variety I hope my first experience here was just an outlier and next time is more enjoyable for me I gave a star for presentation alone and a star for the fact my sister loved her vegan CrÃme BrÃlÃe donut However I honestly cant give a star for my Brad Fritter It was almost flavorless at times I went through large bites of nothing but borderline undercooked dough which I spit out It was rather unpleasant considering what I was anticipating The fritter itself lacked any real sweetness for such a large and doughy item it just didnt work The only sweetness was from the maple glaze which I was searching for because it was delicious when present but it was scarcely drizzled The item suffered because of this There was definitely a generous portion of bacon but again the fritter truly lacked that sweetness to balance that savory More maple drizzle or a glaze would have done wonders I might have even powered through the doughy parts I only ate the bacon and crispy exterior When I return Ill prob just try the maple bacon bar or something seasonal assuming they honor the free donuts Cheers to second chances in a few weeks or so,negative,272,250-300,1553,1500-2000
I dont even what to know what my trip to the dentist will be like after a stop here Novel Ice Cream sure knows what they are doing These flavors are packed with a punch and always rotating Their specialty is jampacking a donut with your flavor and topping toasting it and bringing it to you so you can enjoy a donut sandwich After testing ALL the flavors you will be in a conundrum as to which one to pick but dont worry the staff is amazing and has insight If they are still toasting up the Leslie Knope waffle sandy with a scoop of ice creamI dont know why you wouldnt get that,positive,114,100-150,597,500-1000
I love to bake so I love going to bakeries and checking them out Seeing Buddy on tv led me to believe that his pastries would be top notch since he always seemed so caught up on quality on his shows The pastries were very over priced I paid 21 for a small canoli a cookie a Napoleon and a lobster tail and were a bit of a disappointment They seemed a little soggy and not fresh Honestly not worth going to,negative,82,75-100,417,<500

Back in theday I used to love Amelies and would make my way there once a week Now even with a craving its a chore almost to go I hate feeling rushed and overwhelmed No one wants to be pressured into purchasing the wrong thing Im not saying that I need 30 mins to to make a choice but jeeze is like an assembly line They NEED to figure out a more effective layout of the dessert arealine etc Im sure its possible Its hard especially when you invited someone thats never been before and they cant order because you either cant see anything or asking questions seems to be annoying to them now,negative,114,100-150,608,500-1000
Meh it was just alright East coast has better cupcake bakeries Its just one of those touristy things to do when in Vegas Theres nothing wrong with these cupcakes though Theyre moist and tasty but not the best cupcakes youll ever have Theyre more expensive too but thats on par with Vegas pricing Take a picture at the cupcake ATM and move along,negative,63,50-75,360,<500
Do not buy the bag of cookies that sells for 22 They are not fresh and not worth the money Mine tasted like they were at least 3 days old if not more i went there because of a recommendation on the apple pie Since they were out of apple pies I bought the cookies Overall I was not impressed The meringue with hazelnut was horrible too,negative,67,50-75,344,<500

This place is a little hard to find its tucked behind churchs chicken I had the captain crunch ice cream 2 scoops with the strawberry macaroon and a melted marshmallow on top This isnt your typical ice cream spot and Im so thankful for that The flavors all complemented each other pretty well and the marshmallow maintained its gooey texture throughout my snacking  Great spot my sweet tooth is satisfied,positive,71,50-75,417,<500
This place is so good They have a great combination of unique and original ice cream flavors Everywhere from Cap N Crunch Nutella and Froot Loops flavors to red velvet raspberry sorbet and vanilla I their famous cookie cup with banana and coconut ice cream with a coconut macaron They also roasted a marshmallow on top of it right before they handed it to me This place is as good as advertised,positive,72,50-75,402,<500

I really wanted to like Hopscotch The decor and ambiance is lovely and I really like how you can purchase pieces from local artists and creators However the treats are rather lacking I ordered a butterscotch cookie and a chocolate cupcake with strawberry frosting For the quality they are very overpriced The chocolate cupcake although pretty was very lacking in any chocolate flavor and honestly tasted similar to one from Schnucks The frosting was okay The cookie was better but a little bit too tough My jaw hurt after chewing In addition the customer service left something to be desired The people at the counter seemed quite cool almost judgmental I hope Hopscotch will be able to improve their treats and cheer up a bit Until then Ill probably look somewhere else for coffee and dessert,negative,136,100-150,819,500-1000
I loved this cafe They have a wonderful variety of cakes and treats to go along with your coffee  tea The staff was friendly and the space is great to relax Being there on a Friday night we were surprised how busy it got throughout the time we sat in the cafe Being open late it is a great space to go for after dinner tea and dessert I tried the butterscotch pudding delicious had a hot tea with plenty of water refills and got a blondie to go Love it  will be back next time Im in Lawrenceville,positive,101,100-150,512,500-1000
I wish they opened another 85 bakery here in Vegas They dont always have every bread out Some breads dont get cooked all the way When I order my coffee a certain way they do it wrong U ask for boba and they hardly put any boba on ur drink The fact also that this location gets really packed badlyyy and hardly ever find parking I have a handicap placard due to my disability  people who are not disabled  no handicap placard on their cars park on handicap spots This just makes me sooo mad They need to put signs also to be a 1520min parking ONLYYYY for people who are just buying something fast  leave I love 85 degrees but I wish they opened another location here in Vegas,negative,133,100-150,693,500-1000

For all of us weary from blah softserv Despair no more This ice cream is made in house and is divine We ordered only a pippinsized Banana Split per menu and split it with four adults after a large steak dinner elsewhere The ice creams chocolate strawberry vanilla were welltextured creamy and flavorfulwithout being too sweet The perfect canvas for hot fudge and thick fruity pineapple and strawberry sauces And dont forget to request whipped cream cherry and granulated peanuts Especially the granulated peanutsjust large enough to add salty slightly nutty texture I have lived in the Valley for eight years now and despair at not eating here sooner,positive,109,100-150,683,500-1000
Staff was very rude Me and my husband waited by the register forever to order and no one acknowledged us we stood there for a couple minutes with 4 employees standing behind the counter only one was helping a guest They have a lot of toys in the store my husband was looking at one that was already out of the box and she accused him of opening it and wanted us to pay for it That was all the interaction we had with the staff We moved back over by the Register and waited for a few minutes longer but still nothing and they walked by us twice without even a I will be right with you At that point we left,negative,123,100-150,615,500-1000

This was some really good ice cream It was nice and creamy not so ice milky like some ice creams can be There arent a lot of flavor options but there is a nice amount of toppings available I got the cookies n mint with a little bit of hot fudge on it which was really good Inside there isnt anywhere to sit but if you go out the back they have a really nice area thats connected with their restaurant,positive,81,75-100,411,<500
Amelies is awesome Great pastries sandwiches coffeeetc The people that work here are very friendly and professional The place has a great atmosphere The quiche for breakfast is a must The Salted Caramel Brownie is a must for sweet snack They have plenty of outlets to power your laptop or any other charging needs you may have They never pressure you into a quick trip This place is a great place to meet up with friends to hang out or a place to come and get some work done You cant go wrong here,positive,94,75-100,514,500-1000

Food 2 stars Ambiance 3 stars Service 3 stars Tried the overrated Cannoli and we were underwhelmed Frankly nothing looked super appetizing I would not consider this place a fine bakery and there are much better choices within few steps away But hey we had to give it a try after watching many episodes of Cake Boss Carlo was nice enough to take picture with us in his cutout form  Good bye,negative,73,50-75,405,<500
One of not too many places where you go to get your sweet treat in the area Always line of people out the door Cant use tables inside as too many people waiting in line Today I came for my sundae After waiting in line for some time placed my order and was informed by the cashier that whip cream machine is not functioning since this morning It was 30 minutes before closing timeSeriously All day quality was compromised and not even discount Not good practice Ghirardelli You can afford to make it right for your supporters Very disappointed,negative,99,75-100,558,500-1000
not very impressed 12 for 3 cupcakes not too bad for vegas but the variety sucks qnd the cupcakes were dry and bland to me my son asked if they were sugar free fell apart and hard to eat,negative,39,25-50,190,<500
CEREAL MILK SOFT SERVE ICE CREAM WITH CORN FLAKES 7  the soft serve flavor of cereal milk was on point that being said some may think its too sweet  the corn flakes had a hint of salt to accentuate the flavor of the corn flakes  the overall dessert was a bit expensive and too sweet for 1 person to finish CORN COOKIE  cookie was super soft moist and purposely had corn and hence corn flavored  despite good consistency the cookie was too sweet and didnt leave me craving for more Overall not the first place Id recommend for dessert The soft serve and cookies left me craving water or something to cleanse my palette Ironically there was a juice bar near Milk BarIf you must try this place due to hype consider sharing the soft serve dessert because your wallet and health will thank you,negative,150,100-150,812,500-1000
Had the double chocolate ice cream which was pretty tasty I have a major sweet tooth so this hit the spot Wouldnt say it was the best ice cream Ive ever had but was definitely enjoyable and tasty Great atmosphere and service,positive,42,25-50,231,<500
Why did I wait in line for this place The donuts cookies and pastries were so bland Everything looked so tempting in the display case too I can see why it takes forever toothey first put the items on a tray and then transfer them to a boxbag Then it all goes to a cashier who goes over your order again Seems so inefficient Instead go to Bouchon Bakery or Paris Baguette where you can taste delicious baked goods,negative,79,75-100,428,<500
Food is good Service is unfriendly because the owner doesnt ask the chef to nicely interact with customers unless he feels like it or has time to do so He says the chefs job in a traditional restaurant is to make quality food Horrible attitude and wont go back there,negative,50,25-50,277,<500

Butterwood is open late Thats awesome The deserts are 6 and the coffee is 4 So for 10 per person youve got an awesome after dinner dessert option The cakes are fancy We had a strawberry basil slice and an olive oil almond slice Both were fantastic The frosting to cake ratio was perfect My only warning is the cakes are very heavy If youre only looking for fluffy cake this is not your place,positive,75,50-75,409,<500
Whenever were on the mainland we make sure to search for a Ghirardelli ice cream shop We were so excited and headed over one night We were disappointed with the plastic cups and spoons but Ive eaten it that way at the Giants ballpark so whatever It was delicious other than the fudge It was so hard They need to raise the temperature because Ive never had it like that even in a plastic cup Other than that perfection Good friendly staff and cute shop FYI the names were different from the SF ones were used to,positive,97,75-100,528,500-1000
Can not for the life of me figure out what the hype is all about Disgusting abominations of sugar on top of sugar dense bready thick dry stupidly huge so called donuts Husband went downtown early sat to get some to try since we heard about the place being so great and that they sell out Yeah ok All first timers or tourists and not repeat customers Id be sure 2 days later and they are still sitting on my counter most untouched after we tried a tasting of a few of them And I have a house full of kids one of which is a teenage boy if that tells you anything If they wont eat it you KNOW its bad Lol The cream brÃlÃe best seller Ugh was disgusting Tasteless hard coating of topping that sticks in your teeth on top of basically bread with literally a teaspoon amount of supposed Bavarian creme also not made fresh definitely out of a can Ick Every one we tried had the exact same tasteless dense dense dense bread like dough I would compare it very much like the French bread loaves you get at Walmart for 1 topped or filled with multiple variations of whatever disgusting sugar concoction you can think of Frosting any of them is nothing special and entirely pointlessly overdone tastes like store bought in the cake isle Apple tart topped with bacon one was dry as were all of them due to the bread dough they use Im not sure how in the world you can make an apple filling tasteless but they did it Dumped straight out of a can Super disappointed since that one looked the most promising The pop tart one Well that is one that is still sitting untouched on the counter Just grossly huge pop tart wrapped in bread filled with some sort of sickly sweet jelly and topped with more sugar type topping Oh And sprinkles Puke My kids wouldnt even touch it There is also a sponge bob one so decorated with the gross frosting that my 7 yr old didnt event attempt it Basically it is clear that the object of this place is to make things look interesting enough to buy but absolutely no attention to actual taste quality or ingredients Nothing even remotely tastes like it was hand made fresh Everything is ingredients you can buy in the cake isle and bread isle at the grocery store and make yourself Blagh Hey donutbarYou can stop saying bestdonutsintheworld now please My recommendation and by far superior quality taste freshness service and overall care of product is deesdonuts on centennial and Durango Go check them out and see the difference,negative,452,300- 500,2538,2000+
Awesome place AWSOME DONUTS Awesome coffee Its a cops dream place We met the owner Joe that is always on sayhitomathew on YouTube Very friendly We have been to the Vegas and Riverside location and both kick ass Make sure to get their early because they sell out FAST  they do have vegan options,positive,55,50-75,313,<500

I came here for the Yelp Elite event Sunday evening They closed the place just for us and you could feel the tension in the air as the regular schmegular people walked up smiling only to walk away in disgust Oh well I dont know if it was the fact that we were excited to try the ice cream or that Im sure many of us were having dessert BEFORE dinner That NEVER happens in my world but we all descended upon the place at once and the line was out of the door Unfortunately the weather did not care that we were standing outside because the rain began to pour down on us and we had to move our party inside If you know anything about this place it is small So it became uncomfortable rather quickly but as for me I kept busy talking with a new friend from Florida and trying to narrow down my three top choices I thought I was being proactive when I went online to look at the flavors and decide then but the flavors were different Just like many of the other ice cream shops you are allowed to taste flavors before making a commitment I tried the goat cheese with cherries and sweet corn with blackberries In the end I decided on the Gooey Butter cake first in the cone followed by cream puff and topped with goat cheese with red cherries Insert long deep sigh here First of all the flavors were strategically placed in the cone in a specific order because I had a feeling about that butter cakeeveryone raved about it and whatever flavor is at the bottom of the cone you get to enjoy most See what I did there Let me just say that I live in the University City area and I would have zero problems driving over just for ice cream On that note go get some its totally worth it,positive,327,300- 500,1724,1500-2000
Good ice cream but nothing spectacular Had the brownie swirl which had good taste but felt like it was missing something to make it special Good service as well,negative,29,25-50,165,<500
GREAT ice cream Its a frequent trip for us from St Joe Dont be surprised by long lines but they have a good routine and send the orders out very timely You cant compare it to Jarlings as that is frozen custard but its still very tasty I like that the Facebook page posts their flavor of the week Hope they stay around a long time,positive,66,50-75,343,<500
We were going to make time between shows dining walking the strip sight seeing  relaxing at our beautiful hotel to visit  buy several treats from Carlos Bakery There wasnt any room for discussion it was a must see After watching the show for years recording the shows with DVR  sometimes watching repeats of repeats we were so excited We wound our way through the beautiful hotel  casino arriving at the famously decorated Carlos Bakery to be greeted by a very long line Everyone was smiling conversations were loud  pictures were snapping right  left We watched the bakers busy in the kitchen through the flawlessly polished window We shared stories with the family in front of us who were visiting Carlos Bakery from the midwest for the same reasons  honestly it was somewhat fun waiting in line When we were at the front of the line we had our eyes peeled on each  every dessert we wanted to taste They loaded our boxes we paid a pretty penny  more than we would normally pay at even the best bakeries in the Los Angeles area but we had dreamed of this day  we wanted to sink our teeth into several of Carlos treats We walked away with great anticipation carrying our boxes with joy When we finally sat down to share our treats we examined the smells  textures for a minute  then we began tasting What What is this This must be a bad batch how do you like yours so far Ugh I dont like it it tastes terrible the pastry is rubbery the cream is not creamy it is stiff Lets try something else So one by one we tasted each treat  to our dismay we found only one that tasted very good We loved the sprinkle cookie but it honestly tasted like many other very good sprinkle cookies In closing it was fun the bakery was beautiful with a fun look but we would not go again Only 1 of 7 different treats tasted good  we we heart broken,negative,354,300- 500,1904,1500-2000
First Please note that many people are reviewing the restaurant NOT the bakery My review is for the bakery I have been coming here for years but I am extremely sad to report that my last two visits have revealed that they just dont care any more They seem content to just coast on their laurels selling this stuff to rubes and foreigners The coffee is good but the pastry is where they need to refocus First the biggest offender is their Macarons They served us a nasty hateful hard lump of a cookie last week This thing was seriously rock hard They are supposed to be crispy with a slightly softer interior That is the WHOLE POINT of the cookie When we complained they said that is the way they are supposed to be and the softer ones are old No no they are not You overcooked the crap out of these which formed essentially a meringue I have eaten Macrons across the world and made them myself I was in Paris a few month ago and took down a half dozen of these from Laduree I am pretty familiar with this stupid little cookie because my wife loves them Do not insult me by telling me this hammersubstitute is in any way acceptable They told us to take it up with the downstairs location if we did not like it and refused to refund or exchange the cookie Astounding The rest of the menu items have just gone downhill Their croissants are all but indistinguishable from the stuff they sling at buffets The outside should be flakey and the inside tender Not some glupey congealed mess You know how I know its a terrible croissant There was absolutely no flakes to clean up I hope Dominique Ansel opens a location and shows you guys whats up,negative,308,300- 500,1675,1500-2000
Excellent ice cream unfriendly service It had vibes like the soup episode from Seinfeld I thoroughly enjoyed the ice cream but the service was quite stiff Please lighten up Its ice cream supposed to be fun,negative,36,25-50,211,<500

We had Bouchon Bakery for the first time in Napa a couple of years back It won our heart that day with their baked goodies However yesterday we went to the Bouchon Restaurant with some out of town friends hoping to continue with the great 1st impression but sadly we were deeply disappointed Their waffle and chicken dish was mediocre Their coffee paled in comparision to most coffees out there I am so embarrassed that I brought my friends there  On the upside their ambiance was perfect ,negative,89,75-100,504,500-1000
Had to check out Milk Bar Las Vegas Since its inside of the Cosmopolitan theres plenty of places to sit and enjoy their crack pie soft serve I bought three of their cute totes to take as souvenirs Service was great considering how busy it was Id go back,positive,49,25-50,262,<500

It was okay I was really excited to try this and looked at the menu Personally I wanted to try the cereal soft serve since it sounds so delicious and just make you think that youre back to a being a kid Also the crack pie Heard lots of good things about it When my boyfriend and I came there they let us have samples which was pretty cool The consistency of their product is pretty good Their ice creams were smooth and silky but I didnt grab them cause they were too SWEET I love sweet stuff but this one went over After buying a crack pie and the cereal soft serve I tried the cereal first and it was just meh Its literally some upgraded vanilla ice cream I didnt let that bother me cause I thought the cereal around it would make up for it But no It was just meh It literally just tasted like regular corn flakes from Traders Joe The crack pie was good tho but was really reaaalllyyyy small for the price,negative,179,150-200,930,500-1000
It has a small indoor space but is ideal in the summer Its a bit pricey but the ice cream is delicious It isnt as good as honey hut but its very high quality The staff is friendly and I definitely recommend trying a few flavors before deciding,positive,48,25-50,254,<500

I turned 50 this weekend for a milestone birthday I asked my husband for a birthday cake from Milk Bar Its a tiny cake and cost around 60 The cake is very cute The frosting is good not typical sickeningly sweet frosting The cake itself was the driest most crumbly cake Ive ever had Such a let down It was impossible to cut an actual slice we served a plate of crumbs held together with frosting My one friend said he was so glad we wasted the money on this pretty cake we just saved him 60 bucks I just cant express how disappointed I was with this cake,negative,109,100-150,571,500-1000
If I were you Order literally anything and youll get an amazing treat thats 100 instamaterial I have nothing more to say,positive,22,<50,129,<500
Baked goods are good considering other bakeries available in the area I wouldnt say its great but definitely worth a stop if youre nearby since they are open 24 hours daily Sandwiches are tasty but somewhat smallish The salted caramel brownie is a favorite and baguettes are perfect Ambiance  Atmosphere kitschy bordering on trying too hard noisy  the layout leaves the ordering line blocking the display cases so it can be difficult to have time to shop the offerings when the counter help is asking for your order right when you first see the contents du jour Ill be back when nearby but doubt Id make a special trip to Amelies,negative,113,100-150,647,500-1000
At first I was taken with the Ambience The pastries are works of art And some of the pastries are delightful in taste But all in all I find this place overrated and overpriced Sure some pastries warrant a price that reflects the time involved in their making but Ive found myself and my family eating some only because they cost so damned much there is no way Im throwing them out It is however a fun place to meet for business or hang with friends Definitely more eclectic than luxurious in decor The primary reason I am not eager to return is the lack of love from the staff When I am paying top dollar for something I insist that at least pretend to value my business,negative,128,100-150,689,500-1000
I came here because I heard about all the hype My coworker told me that this place is really good so I decided to check it out I had just finished eating at Block 16 Urban Food Hall so I was in the mood for some yummy dessert I went around 3pm to try their ice cream There was a long line forming since this place is so popular However the line went by fast and I probably only waited around 710 minutes in total to wait pay and get my ice cream I ordered the cereal ice cream and it looked so appetizing to eat I was so excited to try it but when I took my first bite of the ice cream I was so disgusted on how it tasted The ice cream was NOT sweet at all and quite literally tasted like an unsalted stick of butter Ive never had ice cream that tasted that bad and lacked any type of sweetness The only good thing I can say about this is that their presentation is nice Other than that nothing good can be said about the cereal ice cream It was so bad that I could only have a couple bites and I had to throw it away because I couldnt stand eating it anymore This is to no surprise why their ratings arent high despite the popularity of the store My overall experience was not good Perhaps the pies or cookies or their other desserts are better but I will definitely not be coming back You will probably have better luck getting ice cream at a convenience store than at this place,negative,277,250-300,1415,1000-1500

Mediocre food with extremely horrible service The staff was not only rude to the customers but were fighting with each other The guy who took our order had a chip on his shoulder and treated us as if we were annoying him He didnt listen to my order and when I told him he messed up he told me that he already placed my food in the ovenkinda a ohwell to it The baked goods were not good enough for me to come back and deal with all of the negativity that was in that place tonight Im sorry Amelies but you have lost yet another paying customer,negative,108,100-150,559,500-1000

This place is the worse Only 6 small tables and benches to sit at I took my daughters here 4 of us and there was no place to sit Wasnt even busy If you dont mind standing and eating ice cream thats overflowing out of your cup then this place is ok If you like Ghirardelli in San Diego and Monterey dont go here,negative,64,50-75,324,<500

I cannot begin to describe the awesomeness of this hidden gem Flavor orgasm in your mouth Ive been to several ice cream shops and this one is right up there with the best The variety of flavors are a plus and the cookie monster is a must try If youre in the area stop on by The staff was very pleasant I read the angry post by the person that rated them a one star and its hard to believe this establishment would treat anyone without the highest level of respect  Give this place a shot 5 STARS,positive,99,75-100,506,500-1000
Just want to preface this review to say that the decor atmosphere and employees are lovely here This review is solely based on the bakery items Such a disappointment The Black Sesame cake honestly was so dense thick and impossible to take more than 1 bite of The frosting on top tasted like plain sugar Chocolate tart  just not something even worth finishing it tasted stale Came here wIth really high hopes I dont know if this is just a type of baking style that doesnt work for me or if this bakery was just having an off day but I dont see any reason to come here again,negative,110,100-150,587,500-1000
I havent been here since my last review which was about 4 years ago I stopped in today with a friend of mine whos a regular and it was as good as I remember Decent selection of flavors lots to taste and prices were great It was a great treat after a nice lunch to stop in here and get a scoop of real ice cream We were entertained by some of the people who were here while we ate and it was fun to interact with other patrons while we visited There was a guy outside trying to train his dog and give his wife directions to the store while we sat outside and ate our ice creamthat was quite a bit of fun to watch and we had a good laugh Overall I still like sweet republic and should probably stop here more often when Im in the area,positive,151,150-200,750,500-1000
Ambience 910 Looks nice feels clean comfortable Customer Service 810 Assistant manager was great knowledgeable helpful Taste 210 Misugaru latte tasted like drinking dissolved chalk in water Classic Arnold palmer was a very badly conceived balance of tea to lemonade Honey bread was 99 standard dry bread Though it tasted okay the dryness from the rest of the bread overtook any toppings added to it Value 110 Honey bread is probably something close to a 2000 markup on ingredients Cannot go here regularly without breaking the bank If the taste and quality and consistency of the drinks was commensurate with the price then thatd be different since the upcharge would be tied to a higher level of enjoyment from a higher quality product But it seems like they are peddling cheap and badly made drinks and food for outrageous prices Going once a year is probably a good bet for this place Going too often will make you poor and will leave a bad taste in your mouth if the food and drink hasnt already because you feel as though youve paid for a meal and a drink but have been given a hodgepodge of 10 cent ingredients prettied up to look good Great ambience and customer service only get you so far when the food and drink you serve is inconsistent outrageously priced and lackluster at best,negative,228,200-250,1335,1000-1500
Its good  The owner kind of genius imo as you cant walk in the store and you can only see it and Order from the walk up window making all Their customer standing place is free rent,positive,38,25-50,184,<500

Ive been wanting to try this place for a while now Finally decided to go with my son this past Saturday When we arrived I noticed that its a walkup window only Not a problem since we were not going to eat there anyway They have a good size menu with lots of flavors and cookie sandwiches My son decided on the latter and I opted for two scoops on a waffle cone I proceeded to order when the girl tells me that I cannot get two scoops of two different flavors She stated they go by serving size I stood there with a confused look on my face Okay so I cannot get two scoops with two different flavors Isnt a scoop a serving size Im confused She said no then went on to explain their serving size Again I was a little confused Whether it be scoops or serving size she made it seem as if I could not get two different ones on a cone Her explanation was a little weird to me thus leaving a sour taste in my mouth Especially after looking over to the gentleman next to me walking away with two different scoops on a regular cone By the time I received my waffle cone with only one flavor I was annoyed and did not enjoy my it at all I felt like I could have went to Sweet Addiction for Thriftys Ice Cream some of the best in my opinion or Baskin Robbins and been satisfied Now that its been a few days since my visit I feel like I can give a good review without being annoyed as I was initially Will I go back No Was the ice cream good Honestly it was just alright I was very underwhelmed,negative,299,250-300,1521,1500-2000

I ordered a cake for my husbands 50th birthday 2 weeks before we flew out to Vegas and when I went to pick up the cake on the day we arrived they had no record of that order They had no cakes available but could make me one for the next day pick up but it could not be a custom cake because they had to have 2 days preorder I already gave them 2 weeks The next day I picked up the very generic cake and had to sign in 2 places that basically no matter what the issue is I cannot get a refund Now I know why they make you sign this because the cake was HORRIBLE I thought I would be getting my husband this wonderful cake by the Buddy the Cake Boss and I have had better cakes at Costco What a disappointment and waste of time and money I should have ordered it from the Venetian hotel,negative,163,150-200,796,500-1000
spent 60 at this place and the best was the lobster tail the cupcakes were poor at best dry and the buttercream was lacking to say the least  the cannoli were poor I was so looking forward to them the tart was ok but not worth going back for the eclairs were just poor no flavor  its assembly line has lost its home flavor 2 stars only because of lobster tailsad what a waste of 60,negative,78,75-100,396,<500

This is a bittersweet post because my favorite ice cream place of all times for the past 11 years has now been trumped by JENIS All I can say is WOWWWWW She is a chemical genius Literally she uses her secular chemical engineering education to satisfy our sweet palates I tried almost every flavor and they were so creamy and heavenly My favorite was the gooey butter cake which literally had a freshly hand made butter cake mixed throughout the ice cream My husband had a flight of three flavors and wanted more right away We are visiting from Houston and KNOW this would kill out there So Jeni if you are listening please bring this gem to HTown The people need better ice cream Please please please and thank you Oh and you can order them shipped to you online in pints from her original location in Ohio 12 per pint and you have to order at least 3 at a time which when you taste them you will see is not a problem lol they also sell her ice cream in select Publix grocery stores,positive,187,150-200,1005,1000-1500
Unfortunately after having Jean Phillipe Patisserie  Carlos didnt seem as good Tried the lobster tail and cream puff from their place Lobster tail was stuffed with cream which was really good but i found the puff pasty to be harder than normal and chewy Puff pastry was really disappointment as I have had better one in regular cheap bakery shops Maybe other stuff are good which I didnt get to try,negative,72,50-75,408,<500
Expensive almondchocolate croissant and no good at all it is so dry and maybe it is old like couple days No come here,negative,23,<50,121,<500

I am so disappointed TV has a way of really dramatizing an experience Ive waited years to visit The Cake Boss bakery Ive been there twice in less than 10 months and both times fell FLAT Nothing in the bakery deserves higher than 3star Weve tried everything from the cheesecake cake cannoli and cookies Today I said let me try the dipped strawberries The cashier cautioned me they were weighed I asked her to remove the stems bc they werent edible and I lie not they were every bit of 34 inches long She just stood there and shook her head no Four strawberries weighed in at nearly 13 Whoa And they were not that great Just average My local Publix has some for 99 ea THEY ARE DELICIOUS As a special treat if you want an absolutely mouthwatering dessert GO across the hall TO BUDDY Vs for the Italian Bday Cake I think the pastry chef there needs to retrain the cooks at Carlos Bakery,negative,166,150-200,917,500-1000

Yet another frozen napoleon and an attempt from a rather rude individual to educate me considering I have been eating them for over 30 years it fell on deaf ears and he was a douche bag to boot Then tried to educate me on health code Im food and safety certified and my first restaurant I owned at 18 again on deaf ears he was again a douche me brining a major celebrity in the music industry here as a treat was a mistake we both returned our desserts,negative,89,75-100,485,<500
You have to see these donuts to believe them On top of the sheer size of some of them the selection is awesome and they taste incredible So worth the visit Dont get there late Youll miss out and youll regret it,positive,42,25-50,219,<500
Anyone who says Bouchon has great macarons clearly does not know anything about macarons I consider myself somewhat of a macaron connoisseur having discovered them while living in Paris a few years ago The macarons at Bouchon are horrible They are overly big too dense and chewy and overrefrigerated They were not fresh or delicate at all Not even holding them to the lofty standard of Pierre HermÃ or LadurÃe they still pale in comparison to other places in NYC San Fran and Vancouver We usually sit and savor every last crumb but at Bouchon we didnt even want to finish them It was a chore And way overpriced The only reason it gets two stars is because the TKO like an adult Oreo cookie was good,negative,127,100-150,722,500-1000
Not sure what the big deal was on these Even though we stopped by at noon the donuts should of tasted fresh if bake today The 4 different ones we got all tasted dry like day or 2 days old Paid 11 for 4 donuts Felt was too much,negative,49,25-50,234,<500
Dont give into the hype I love buddy but after visiting his shop I was very disappointed Everything looks very pretty but there is no flavor to any of it I got the lobster tail cannoli orea cake thing a cupcake All flavorless  I HIGHLY recommend going to Freeds if youre actually looking for great pastries and not just to visit a place thats on TV,negative,67,50-75,364,<500
Nice lil surprise on our overnight visit to Madison and the world well locally famous Willy Street As an outoftowner Id recommend it to any visitor looking to top off an eating trip to this foodable city I had a scone and my partner had a mini vanilla swirl Both were great especially the swirl rich buttery and flaky Yeah Dont forget cash only,positive,64,50-75,365,<500
Huge line to get in about half an hour which made me think it must be good When we get to front we are rushed to choose and asked if we can decide quickly because if the line Not only is that rude but the world famous bakery wasnt worth the wait whatsoever We ordered chocolate covered cannoli and Oreo cake We were all disappointed and pretty much were thinking we wasted a half hour No where to sit rude worker handling line rude worker taking order and rude cashier Will not go back,negative,94,75-100,497,<500
Looks like a mom  pops shop Fairly small  not a huge selection but very well stocked Lots of vintage old school candy Staff was friendly  helpful I got the FAT ELVIS SUNDAE  man was it delicious I recommended 110,positive,43,25-50,223,<500
I have a HUGE sweet tooth so I was looking forward to some good dessert but unfortunately this fell far short of expectations This review is based on the cookies and cake balls First of all the cookies are packaged Based on that plus how they tasted they definitely dont seem baked fresh The cookies had a stale andor freezer burnt taste They also tasted oddly bland I couldnt even finish it because it just wasnt enjoyable As for the cake balls they came out so cold that they were pretty much frozen which again makes me think theyre not baked fresh When I bit into it all I tasted was pure sugar and nothing else Also the inside is extremely dense It doesnt even taste like cake The texture was almost like a thick paste Maybe thats what happens when you freeze cake and then it thaws I really wanted to like this place considering I love dessert and Im a fan of both David Chang and Christina Tosi but the product does not stack up at all to the hype,negative,182,150-200,985,500-1000
Not worth it Wasnt planning on trying the place but was desperate for breakfast since the eggslut line was super long Ordered cornflake marshmallow chocolate chip cookie and the bday truffles Prices are ridiculous My cookie was just ok Way too salty and not enough chocolate The marshmallow seems pointless as it gives the cookie a weird chewy texture but not the good kind The truffles were good but super sweet you can only eat one and need to down water after Pretty much cake pops without the icing Not worth it,negative,92,75-100,525,500-1000
Came in earlier because they usually run out of the popular pastries starting at 12pm No wait at all and service is quick and friendly The only disappointment is the seating They do not have indoor seating area kinda cold during winter season,positive,43,25-50,248,<500

I was there at the grand opening at 9 got there around 800am and was one of the first 25 people  They had UNLV cheerleaders to cheer and had a great opening The bread was nice and fresh Respect for the managers to have crowd control and not let it look like a Hong Kong protest inside with people grabbing bread off the trays before they hit the shelf They handled that pretty well I got everything I could on my tray two mugs and the yardstick for the first 100 customers The above review is 5 stars worthy for the morning the reason why I put a one star is for people who are curious and for the managers to look at how they did cause they care about the business and need customer feedback I went back there at night because I gave most of the bread pastries away to my coworkers since we had a birthday celebration I did not have a chance to try the matcha custard bread milk pudding bun the croquette bun etc I went back hoping there was still more at night instead it was mostly subpar items like muffins and the egg tarts None of the premium items I saw in the morning or mentioned above or the ones you see in the morning review posts It was just pumping out the same bread and put it in three different places I saw the berry tart like in three different shelves and muffins that anyone can go get at Starbucks It was just selling bread at that point for profit since there was a demand there but also because they probably ran out of ingredients for the other items Here is the reason where they screwed up Since the morning it was pretty chaotic with all the excitement I forgot to ask if the free yardstick was refillable or not I heard the regional divisional manager say this is the first of its kind for Las Vegas since it has Vegas themes on the free items I could not hear if he said free refills or  no refills for the yardstick I went back at night to ask and clarify I asked three employees and they did not know Till I asked the lady at the drink section kindly if it was free refill or not The cashier next to her heard me and said in an angry tone NO REFILL then mumbled to her coworker  they brought it up in the meeting the one I asked kindly went to her manager and asked and she came back and told me no without yelling No REFILL like the other cashier did I accepted it since i wasnt sure due to all the noise in the morning The one star is for the rude cashier at the front All it takes is one thing to ruin the whole experience the customers are the driving force for the business but if they have cashiers not able to handle the customers then people reading should be aware to expect it Bread was perfect grand opening was perfect Ask a question and get an angry response from another employee and I am willing to spend the time to write this one star review Do yourself a favor Dont go there at night and grab the leftover inventory Wait till the hype goes down and they train their employees to be nice and courteous to the customers,negative,583,500+,3020,2000+
I was quite happy when Batch opened Its down the street from my house so nearly every day Ive walked past it and stared at the kitchen window where people are baking It always looked so delicious However Im not sure if I havent tried the right items yet or if Im just picky about bread because both the baguette and the croissant were just mediocre Its definitely good quality compared to the average bread I get at Madison restaurants but it doesnt come close to the baked goods at Sophias a hrefhttpwwwyelpcombizsophiasbakeryandcafemadisonyelpcombizsophiasbaka or loaves of bread from Madison Sourdough a hrefhttpwwwyelpcombizmadisonsourdoughcompanyincmadisonyelpcombizmadisonsoua Specifically the bread didnt really taste like anything I would think it hadnt been given enough time to rest and develop flavor through longer fermentation or like they hadnt started with a poolish starter Texturally the baguette was too fluffy and uniform inside with no little air pockets or visible strands of gluten structure The flavor of the croissant was good but the texture seemed too dense and packed together like the butter hadnt broken through the layers the way it is supposed to I would also suggest a little less marzipan inside the almond croissant  it was a bit too sweet I enjoyed their fougasse which is a little bit like a focaccia Given the weaknesses with their dough this makes sense since a fougasse has a fair amount of oil and herbs that can cover up a flavorless dough Maybe I was there on an off day or maybe I havent tried the right items Ill certainly be back another time or two but Im keeping my expectations lower next time,negative,276,250-300,1741,1500-2000

Maybe Ill have to give it another go Was so excited to finally try this place after all the talk and the hype and such Maybe because it was later in the night we went maybe it was an off night but the whole experience left me confused What was all the hype about The cookies come prepackaged which left me thinking soooooo theyre not made fresh Shouldve taken that as a warning Took a bite and all I can taste was sugar You couldve given me a store bought cookie put it in the same wrap and I wouldve never tasted the difference The truffles were okay have you tasted Godivas birthday cake truffles you should its better,negative,119,100-150,643,500-1000

BECAREFUL WITH THIS PLACE The customer service is zero The price is pricey but the cake quality is poor I bought the birthday cake for my husband  coffee cream brÃlÃe the coffee cream taste like medicine very strong bitter taste I drinks coffee  I know how coffee taste This is not the taste of coffee I called  speak with the manager  her name is Edna  she not try to accommodate me with anything She said nothing she cant do that is just the way the cake tastes Becareful with this business This is my first time  its going to be my last time order cake from this 85 degree bakery shit We only eat the strawberry  try the cream  we throw almost the whole cake away,negative,134,100-150,692,500-1000
The pastries are a little stale Had the chocolate eclair The filling seemed a little too cold and the pastry lacked flavor A bit of a line and wait to get the pastry unless you go early in the morning or in the afternoon I would say not worth the money nor time required,negative,54,50-75,275,<500
I used to go to mary coyle many years ago and loved it I tried this new mary Coyle It was the biggest disappointment ever For starts there are no menus to look at I had to use my phone to look up the menu before placing my order I ordered a sundae with hot fudge The hot fudge was not hot and appeared as if it had been scraped from the bottom of a burned pot It was terrible When asked about the hot fudge the sole employee resoonded thats all we have Needless to say i will not return nor would i ever recommend mary coyle to any of my friends,negative,113,100-150,558,500-1000
This little bakery had a lot of options from cake slices cupcakes cookies cookie sandwiches and unique authentic pastries The place is bright and clean and the staff was friendly Unfortunately everything we sampled two cookies and a cupcake were lacking in flavor and were just lack luster Because its Vegas we spent much more on these items than we would back home and that was salt in the wound There has got to be better dessertpastry shops in Vegas,negative,80,75-100,468,<500
I dont even know where to begin other than to say I am so extremely disappointed by the customer service from this establishment I have never written a review but had to do it now My daughter is turning 16 on Sunday She is a vegan I searched the Internet looking for an establishment that would make a two tiered vegan birthday cake I found the Butterwood They were closed the day I found them however their website allowed for online orders I placed my order on a Tuesday they processed my 144 and I emailed that same day asking if I would be able to speak to someone about my order i wanted to make sure that I could get the cake for that Sunday because I didnt indicate that when I orderedthere wasnt a space for that and I realized that after placing the order In the email I said that I would call during their business hrs I called the following day wed and spoke with one of the workers and asked all of my Qs She assured me that they could have it for me on Sunday My next questions were about the decorations on the cake I asked if they could write happy 16th birthday on it She said that they only decorated with fresh flowers and do not write on them She said she would speak to her MGR and ask If they would make an exception She took my name and number and said she would get back to me I never received a call So I called back on Thursday I spoke with a different employee who found the note that was written with my Qs I explained to her that nobody called me back as they said they would She explained to me that her manager had been in New York all weekShe said I could have the cake by Sunday but didnt know that they could decorate like I asked she said she would text her MGR and someone would get back to me I asked her to get back to me ASAP because if I decided not to go with them I would need 48 hrs notice to order from Whole Foods She assured me someone would get back to me After thinking about the decorations and talking with friends and family I figured I would just continue with the order So I didnt give it another thought figuring I would just pick it up on Sunday I was telling a friend of mine what type of cake and from where and the backstory and she suggested I call to make sure all was in order because of the lack of  As she said professionalism with never returning calls So I called sat afternoon only to be told that they cant fulfill the order at allno cake even with flowers on it Whaaaaat I explained everything to her and she said she was sorry but the employees I spoke to should have known and shouldnt have taken my order because they havent been taking orders for a couple of months and this was indicated on the website I explained to her that I spoke with two of her employees on two separate occasions that assured me I could have that cake for Sunday and when I placed the order they took my 144 as I said early I explained again that I would have needed 48 hours notice to get a vegan cake from Whole Foods as I told her employee previously she told me she was the manager that was in New York I explained that I could not get a vegan cake to serve enough people on such short notice And all she said was Im sorry I asked if there was anything she could do to help All I got was a no Nothing to try to help fix this their mistake their error their lack of professionalism Now I have no cake for my daughter who is having many friends and family over to celebrate her sweet 16 I know it may not be a big deal to some but it is to a girl turning 16 who is vegan and thought she had a birthday cake,negative,713,500+,3650,2000+
This review is the average of the ice cream 5 stars and ramen 3 stars overall giving it 45 There is street parking around no lot Watch out for the one way street across from it They let you share their staff bathroom There is outside seating when its warm and they made it into a tent with heated lamps during the winter months Came here for ice cream summer 2021 and it was fantastic Having moved from LA I miss the unique Asian ice cream flavors For people that are adventurous and want to experience a whole different level of ice cream fusion this is the best place for Asian flavored ice cream Its super creamy and a good deal As for ramen game here the first week of December and ordered the tonkatsu which is usually ramen classic Not sure if its Covid but everything comes out like you get ramen to go Unfortunately our broth was warm and you usually want hot ramen The egg inside was also cold Once the warm soup was poured over cold things it just wasnt the warm soupy feeling you want with ramen The flavor was decent but not spectacular The portion also was small compared to watch you expect from a ramen place This place is also a little bit more expensive than other ramen chains,positive,226,200-250,1235,1000-1500
Unfortunately Thomas Kellers Bouchon Bakery at the Venetian was a huge disappointment It began with trying to find the small counter located in a most obscure location within the massive property of the Venetian Hotel I felt so frustrated by the time we finally arrived and made a comment about the location to one of the many employees behind the counter The young lady looked at me and shrugged her shoulders She couldnt have cared less Remember This is a Thomas Keller experience and I guess I should have remembered that part Once I made my selections I was passed over to the cashier or was it one of the many other people behind the counter they were literally bumping into one another because there were so many people behind the counter where I repeated my order to her and cashed out I had selected the ham and cheese on a baguette that was heated up for me and was good No complaints The bread was fresh and because it was heated had a nice crunch to it I had also ordered several other products for the sake of this review and because having recently returned from a 3 month stay in France wanted to have the opportunity to make a fair comparison Keep in mind my selections with the exception of the TKO are standard faire anywhere in France so in my mind the right selections for the sake of comparison The almond croissant was so heavy weight As soon as I picked it up I knew it was nowhere close to an almond croissant one would find anywhere in France or any Stateside French bakery It was FILLED with almond paste and there was no flakiness whatsoever to the pastry I took a couple of bites and tossed it I pulled the Financier from the bag and took a couple of bites of it and it too was just a big heavy something or other I am not trying to sound like a snob but I have come to realize there are American French sounds good Bakeries and there are French Bakeries This is definitely an American style French Bakery The products are heavy way too big in size and lack any French to them So to wrap it up I thought the employees made me feel like I was lucky to be at a Thomas Keller establishment The location or secret hiding place of this particular kiosk or counter was ridiculous And finally it is not a French Bakery but a bakery where you can pick up something that resembles a bakery item you would find in France or most French Bakeries Stateside Sorry Thomasjust sayin,negative,449,300- 500,2448,2000+

There is a lot of variety at Rewind from soft serve with mixins various sweet tea concoctions and scoop ice cream I tried a vanilla swirl with Reeses peanut butter cups mixed in  kind of like a Blizzard at DQ with banana slices on top The ice cream was quite sweet The presentation was nice with bananas strategically placed It was very soft and started melting over my cup almost immediately even though it was a cold day so prepare to start eating right away,positive,86,75-100,472,<500
This location in Las Vegas is not up to par to the one in NYC The 2 stars is for service and quality of the macaron and croissant First it was obvious I was next in line and the counter girl took the guy behind me There were 3 other workers milling around either inside the kitchen or doing inventory None of them acknowledged me even with my irritated face Finally one of the workers asked what I wanted The macaron was cold meaning it was not fresh I also got the almond croissant if Ive known this before hand I wouldve never wasted my money Again it was not fresh it was dry and lacked almond cream filling The vanilla macaron that I usually get at Bouchons in Columbus Circle is so fresh decadent and service is great If Thomas Keller knew about the quality of the products that theyre serving here he would be appalled Two wrongs will never make a right Service sucks and so do their products Shame on you,negative,174,150-200,937,500-1000
I wanted to love this place sooo bad Being very accessible in the cosmo my hopes were pretty crushed Being gluten sensitive I was very excited to try their GF option cookie but for some reason I felt like there line of well everything was TOO salty for my palette My fiancÃ agreed as well We were lucky to be helped by the nice staff and tried every soft serve flavor but every flavor was salty still So we decided on cookies to go back to our room since we were only upstairs Ate only 14 of the cookie and had a major headache and salty taste in my mouth So sad,negative,112,100-150,577,500-1000
Updating my review to this place because I went back with my boyfriend a second time Although the girl working was really nice I had noticed that there were no chocolate based flavors For how many options they had I thought that was a little crazy to not have a traditional chocolate flavor or even a chocolate peanut butter or something Biggest reason for the review changeLast time I rated this place my boyfriend was the one making the purchase so he paid This time we went for the special they have which adds a macaroon and a toasted marshmallow on top of your ice cream I thought the menu board said they were 10 each which is too much money for what you get in my opinion I remember tipping on top of it And then when I checked my bank statement the next day it said I spent 2824 here Almost 30 for essentially two scoops of ice cream plus some toppings PASS I dont think Ill come back here if these are their prices because their ice cream is not worth that much Even had I tipped 20 which I think I did it should have been 25 again too much so to randomly add an over 8 tip is outrageous for what you are getting Im not sure how that happened but I doubt Id come back If I dosomeone else better be paying,negative,238,200-250,1266,1000-1500
This ice cream is arguably up there with Clevelands famous Mitchells My coworker had mentioned it to me when I spoke of my passion and snobbery for ice cream good ice cream not DQ blizzards or McDonalds mcflurries no shade it just aint real ice cream When my boyfriend and I pulled up it was a tiny run down stand with a crowd of people The stand was located in a strange area with a lot of bare footed and shirtless children running around playing in the water fountain To say the least we were a tad skeptical but had driven a decent amount so we waited out the line and took a leap of faith The leap paid off bc wow this ice cream will knock your socks off Get the honey pecan or salted Carmel or even the banana I actually dont think many of their flavors will disappoint because this ice cream is REAL,positive,157,150-200,824,500-1000
Ive been waiting for this place to open and it didnt disappoint It may seem small but I would say the perfect size for this location The ice cream was excellent I got Black Raspberry in a paper cup I know they have a lot of ice cream offerings in 3 sizes of cups plus waffle cones not sure about other things Its new clean old fashion ice cream parlor vibe I recommend it,positive,74,50-75,384,<500

We went to this bakery December 2014  Waiting in line for an hour we got to the front and ordered 2 chocolate cupcakes  Looking forward to eating a delicious cupcake I sat down with my boyfriend after taking a bite I was very disappointed The cupcake was dry and tastes worse than a zinger Not only dry but the quality was very poor The beautiful box packing is very deceiving  I do not recommend this bakery Thumbs down,negative,81,75-100,428,<500
I woke up this morning 7 AM because I was going to go try The Donut Bar There was so much hype about this place from USA today to the food network to Ellen I was energized and ready to go I got there at 750 in the morning and it was easy to find parking There was already a line of at least 40 people ahead of me who were also waiting for a shop that was about to open at 8 AM The wait time to get in once the shop opens at 8 AM was 30 minutes in line outside Luckily it was a pleasant day As I approached the inside of the store I was surprised to see that I wasnt all that excited I saw many very large looking donuts with hard tacky frosting that werent at all appealing The oversized amount made them less appealing rather than to appear yummy The smaller donuts looked good and by smaller I mean normal size like Dunkin Donuts regular donuts The service was just OK Whoever chose to run this place really doesnt seem to understand what the best environment for customer service is It was glaring super loud music over the speakers where I could barely hear the person helping me and Im not sure if they could hear me I had to order several donuts for a party and thought this is a good place to try because it gets so much publicity so it has to be good I decided to put my instincts aside because so many people were waiting in front of me and behind me to get into this place and it has gotten all these reviews As I ordered after two dozen donuts the server just went off to help somebody else without even asking me if I was finished with my order I couldnt believe it I was very friendly during the whole interaction which is why this shocked me I did not bother calling her back because I am not confrontational and simply will let something like this go but wont let it go during a review The donuts range from two dollars that are very small to some pastries that are upwards of four dollars I ordered several donuts including the Twix Samoa blueberry with lemon chai Nutella Red velvet and the crÃme brÃlÃe Here is what I have to say firstly you have to eat these donuts the day of because they are not as good the next day With that being said most of the donuts were not that impressive to begin with They were just ok or disappointing In fact the crÃme brÃlÃe donut which gets all of this amazing hype was one of the worst ones of the bunch The hard sugarCaramel crust on top of the donut was so burnt that it carried a foul aftertaste The donut itself had a yummy crÃme brÃlÃe center within the dough The topping of the crunchy burnt sugarCaramel ruined it I also did not like that many of the donuts were grossly over sized with a great deal of tacky frosting on it which was glazed and dried off I did order a couple of those and they were not very good This place is OK I did not try the coffee and I wonder if that wouldve changed my mind and increased their ratings The donuts are so so They arent that much better than other places or dont cost a lot less so I do not know what people are talking about Also the wait time and price just isnt worth it It is a very popular place and a lot of people come here Not sure if there are people that love donuts so much that this is considered great quality I love food and have been very fortunate to taste some phenomenal food internationally at some of the best places I know donuts and sadly the donut bar does not have anywhere close to the best donuts around The two stars are because it is expensive the service was disappointing the wait time to get the donuts was way too long for thisand the donuts did not impress I am glad I tried it just take the hype away and I should have gone with my instincts,negative,726,500+,3773,2000+
The ice cream here is always amazing Its soooooo creamy I also love all the flavor options which rotate weekly or monthly I just wish they could enforce maskwearing among patrons Some customers were good and considerate while others decided they were above others safety I dont expect Handels workers to police too much but they could certainly refuse service to those not wearing masks I ordered 2 pints one coffee wchoc chips another choc malt wcaramel Love love loved the coffee flavor So delicious The fam finished that quickly The choc malt is tasty but a bit on the ultra sweet side Also I was hoping for caramel ribbons You cant really see any caramel I suppose its mixed in Anyway still delicious ice cream,positive,126,100-150,745,500-1000
I was expecting it to be better I got a brownie and a cream puff and both were average Ive had better at a supermarket I love cake boss so I was hoping this would be good Ill just stick to the cupcakery for my baked goods,negative,47,25-50,228,<500
MILK BAR is next door to Momofuku at the Cosmo hotel Come here for unique treats such as their famous crack pie Its a buttery shortbread crust with a dense chewy butter cake that is out of this world If you get one thing there get that But of course they sell individual cookies from chocolate chip cornflake cookies confetti cookies to their compost cookie which I bought as souvenirs,positive,70,50-75,397,<500
Looking for good Macarons in Las Vegas Bouchon Bakery has your craving fix I wouldve given them 5 stars but 2 things knocked them dow for meprice and flavor selection Macarons fresh soft filled with flavor Larger than typical macarons Quality and freshness wisebest Ive had so far Flavors It changes from season to season but they have their general flavors and usually a seasonal featured flavor What Ive tried  Mint Chocolate Chip delish It was like eating a puffy andes mint Mint and chocolate was balanced perfectly Had to special order these puppies though because they were out of season  Vanilla simple and creamy  Pistachio great taste and flavorful  Pumpkin seasonal but surprisingly GREAT  Coffee not bad Location Located in Venetian Casino hotel under and behind the escalators by the Grand Luxe Restaurant If price isnt a factor then I would highly recommend,positive,149,100-150,918,500-1000
Well I expected better I was super excited to come here First I tried pink donuts and I really liked them Then I thought this place would be better Well it wasnt I am the biggest donut critic I got the cake batter ores cake batter and apple fritters Also got blue pop tart and bacon Apple fritters were over cooked Like you can see the dark color and hardness on the donut Barely any glaze on it too The cake batter was way bigger in size then others which was weird to me because usually apple fritters are bigger then most The Oreo was so tiny compared to the rest Cake batter was pretty much just dipped icing donut with icing blobs on top Sooo meh Oreo cake batter well just basically a stuffed donut with Oreos in middle with icing on top Pop tart donut also overcooked with tiny icing on top All very meh donuts and overly priced If you want a good donut go to pinks Lease they are usually stocked and fresh and way better tasting Especially if you are advertising cake batter it should take like cake batter like the one at pinks ,negative,200,150-200,1066,1000-1500

This place is such a gem under an overpass I drive past Page Dairy Mart every day after work and there is always a long line at 330 in the afternoon even in a downpour of rain I finally stopped one day and it was so good its now going to become a bad habit I went simple  swirl soft serve ice cream on a cake coke So yummy and nostalgic They have tons of flavors and dips though so I hope to try out more in the future Maybe Ill even try one of the many sundaes they advertise There is no inside you order from a window They dont accept cash but there is an ATM around the corner of the building The menu is pretty extensive so make sure youre studying all the options while youre waiting in line The parking situation is decent there are a lot of spots that surround Pages,positive,157,150-200,799,500-1000
Seems like some people in Champaign dont appreciate what they have in this place Reasonably priced great tasting custard and sundaes They now accept cards as payment and their service is always solid Its amazing to me that people are really making comments about the time it takes to get served Its a popular place and Ive never had to wait longer than 10 minutes Best ice cream in the area hands down,positive,73,50-75,415,<500

I have been a Buddy fan since he won the baking competition that lead to him getting his show on TLC I have also been a fan of his competition show and cooking show Living in LA I never had an opportunity to try any of his baked goods My niece just got married in Vegas and just wanted something small and nice to use to cut the cake since neither of them were big cake eater I immediately suggested Carlos Bakery I raved about Buddy and the show and told them it should be a great experience It was not The staff was dismissive and and the red velvet cupcakes and mini cheesecakes we bought were sub par to say the least I was shocked I feel the quality and familia atmosphere has gone down to expansion and profit What a shame,negative,143,100-150,747,500-1000
Service was fine food was underwhelming disappointing We tried two of their signature items Cereal Milk soft serve had a sort of sharp taste almost like off milk and Milk Bar Pie very small serving but still didnt want to finish it served cold from fridge so it was hard and tasted of nothing except butter and sugar Havent even tried the cookies yet they dont look particularly fresh since each individually sealed in plastic Not worth the price or calories,negative,81,75-100,474,<500
The moment I took a bite of my donut ice cream sandwich the words HOLY F involuntarily jumped from my lips The ice cream is rich creamy incredible and would make anyone gleeful by itself But the donut  dear GOD the donut is justjust I dont have the right words to accurately describe it Succulent Can you use the word succulent to describe a donut Its so soft yet substantial It doesnt fall apart or collapse like other particularly soft donuts Ive had Its perfectly moist fresh sticky without being too messy I just wow Literally the best Ive EVER had Plus the owners are super nice friendly and chill Two thumbs up arent enough,positive,116,100-150,679,500-1000

Ive been here about ten times 6 for just a cup of coffee 4 for the donuts I dont get it I try and try and try and I cant bring myself to get excited over them We came here when they first opened and I thought They dont have their temperatures measurements converted to the altitude of Vegas as theyre a shop based out of San Diego if Im remembering correctly If you order a plain donut thats not filled or stuffed with a cookie theyre all dry  The worst part is that theyre so expensive A single plain donut is 2 Anywhere else a single glazed donut is 99 cents or less They only get more expensive the more creative they get The French toast donut is really good but doesnt need the syrup or extra blueberry topping since the donut is already covered in powdered sugar AND glaze When youre feeling extra gluttonous I think it hits the spot The only other saving grace is their hazelnut Kona coffee which I think I found the same one online so I can save myself the trip parking meter fee and disappointment of dry donuts,negative,197,150-200,1057,1000-1500
After walking around touring LV sites on a hot 109 degree day a couple friends and I decided to stop here to get some ice cream I ordered a scoop of cookie dough ice cream in a chocolate dipped cone It was absolutely delicious The perfect treat for a hot day The ice cream was delicious and super creamy Im from Maryland so Im super depressed that we dont have a Ghirardelli ice cream shop here Ive searched everywhere Location We were staying at the flamingo hotel so this ice cream shop was less than a 5 min walk from our hotel Located right on the strip Im not too sure about parking etc because i dont live in Vegas and we walked from our hotel This ice cream shop is the only shop that offered free water there were several occasions were my friends and i were literally almost dying of thirst and no restaurantshop offered free water even if you purchase something They offered it right in the restaurant in a dispenser with cups which was very nice of them Staffcustomer service the staff were very friendly My ice cream cost less than 5 if Im not mistaken My ice cream took less than 5 minutes to be ready You also get a free piece of chocolate with a purchase dark chocolate There are about 56 tables at the shop which you can sit at Both times i went there were seats available,positive,245,200-250,1336,1000-1500
I love ice cream no matter what but this place was amazing to me because of the people behind the counter So fun So cute So nice The guy was really excited to torch the marshmallow fluff i ordered and it was perfect Ice cream was amazing as expected I got a double scoop because my eyes are bigger than my stomach and it was too much Peanut butter tastes like a cookie as opposed to from out the jar Tiramisu has the right hint of amaretto Oh I also grabbed one of those salted caramel things in the front I assume its house made but wow its so buttery salty and 50 cents Hehe get one on the go So worth it if youre a caramel lover like me Cant wait to go back Its a really hip and crowded place,positive,142,100-150,715,500-1000
My childhood was punctuated with trips to the chocolate shoppe to buy childrens poison which makes them hysterical I mean blue moon Oh how I loved the blue staining delight We stopped in this summer and had a horrible experience We were under the impression that cones were 50 cents because of the promotional poster on the window Upon asking politely I may add why the price difference we were met with yelling Not loud talking but yelling When my husband said that we would still buy it the gentlemen in his 50s dumped the ice cream back into the bucket That sucked We left And while I can never be sure I do have my hunches that if my husband was white we would have been treated differently I sent the company an email and was never responded to,negative,140,100-150,770,500-1000

I was recommend by a local to come to this location Id have to say the quality of service was terrible I was not greeted No one standing in line but yet I was rushed As if I should have known to not ask questions to the cashier I was confused as the amount of money being charged and asked that she repeat order And I had to tell her she was adding items from another incoming party After leaving I reviewed the pastries and bill and still had other charges I had to return to have them correct it I purchased 4 chocolate crossiants eclair apple turnover brownie Perhaps it was an old batch but not impressed with either items Too dry,negative,123,100-150,650,500-1000

I expected so much better from here Ive heard a lot about this place for years now Was not able to try it in New York since it was closed the day I was there Very excited to see that it opened in Vegas Got the chocolate cookie and cereal milk ice cream The cookie was dry and stale Not fresh at all Wasnt that sweet either Very gross The cereal milk tasted salty not sweet and just very weird overall Thank goodness I just got a sample as I ended up tossing it away after a few bites I cant remember the last time I didnt finish icecream which shows how bad it was They have other stuff here but these are the famous ones and it was disgusting No line Wont return,negative,134,100-150,688,500-1000

With all the hype Sprinkles gets my expectations were overpriced I figured about 6 dollars per cupcake but really tasty cupcakes I was wrong on both accounts We arrived and chose the cupcake line There is a separate counter for ice cream and cookies I was pleased the prices were reasonable 300 for a cupcake is on par with less trendy shops I was disappointed that they did not have most of the flavors which were listed on the wall I settled on a raspberry cupcake as the sign said it was a seasonal favorite while my daughter ordered their specialty red velvet cupcake and we also tried their mini chocolate marshmallow for 200 The chocolate marshmallow cupcake was horrible Neither my daughter nor I could finish it and it tasted like a rum based dark chocolate topping with a strong bitterness The raspberry cupcake was overly sweet but definitely tasted like fresh raspberries were used in the making of the frosting I could only handle a small bite of it due to the sweetness Unfortunately the cupcake was not moist inside and rather crumbly It tasted stale or store bought instead of handmade The red velvet cupcake was only slightly moister but when I picked it up the top came off and the cupcake fell to the ground I am all for cupcake tops but this only happens with dry cupcakes The flavor on the red velvet cupcake was good and this is the only one of the three I would ever try again,negative,255,250-300,1423,1000-1500

Cereal milk soft serve topped with cornflakes FOREVA So let me preface my review with The Before I practically rolled myself out of Momofoku looking like Violet Beauregarde after indulging in an unbelievably incredible and massive dinner I was SO full you guys and that is genuinely an understatement I overestimated the allotment of stomach space I thought I saved to try Milk Bars soft serve afterwards  when judgement time arrived I failed myself and my taste buds and sadly commenced my foodie walk of shame past Milk Bar tear FFW a couple of hours and viola  I found myself back at Milk Bar feeling like a champ around 1am to claim my prize Mind you I was still full so I decided to split an order with my friend As soon as it hit my lips my god the heavens spoke to me That serving even if just half was everything in a dessert I never knew I wanted until then I know its a bold statement but I think I experienced nirvana you guys who knows I just know that it was me that cup of soft serve and those cornflakes for a good 10 minutes and nothing else mattered Anyway we ate at Wicked Spoon for lunch the next day and you best belie I beelined it back to Milk Bar afterwards and ordered my OWN cereal milk soft serve w cornflakes yuuum It was just as heavenly as the first time Bummed their only locations are NYC DC Toronto Las Vegas Heres to hoping they open one in LA sooner rather than later until then Ill just be over here daydreaming of that magical encounter,positive,281,250-300,1527,1500-2000

Churn is a cute little gourmet ice cream shop in central Phoenix They are located on Central Avenue near Camelback The location has very limited parking and a difficult street access If you make it inside prepare for a long wait The shop resembles an old fashioned ice cream parlor with a modern twist Those that brave the parking and line will be rewarded with a good selection of fresh and delicious ice cream Churn has the standard flavors and a selection of rotating specialties Coffee and candy are also available I chose the butter pecan in a pretzel cone The pretzel cone costs extra but is a perfect salty addition to the butter pecan and similar flavors It has a plastic sleeve to help keep things clean Churn is really 45 stars losing a bit for minor hassles and a slightly grainy ice cream base but this is still an excellent ice cream option in Phoenix and should be part of anyones list,positive,164,150-200,914,500-1000
I really really do not like this place They charge close to 10 for honey breadIts literally a piece of bread with honey whipped cream and fruit on top Rip off Also their bubble tea is gross clearly from a powder and tastes super artificial Just dont come here This is one of the only businesses in town that I sincerely hope closes I know they are a huge chain in Korea and with such a big Korean population during the school year I assume it will thrive so I guess its here to stay and suck,negative,97,75-100,513,500-1000

Gourmet ice cream at its best I stumbled upon this place in a vacation magazine that gave great reviews  since I was heading down to Scottsdale I thought why not stop by  check it out This place makes all of their ice cream frozen yogurts  sorbets It doesnt get any better than homemade stuff in small batches The Salted Butter Caramel was wonderfully creamy light with just enough hint of salt Almost tasted just like Fleur de Sal caramel The Peanut Butter Chip was made with organic slow churned Virginia peanuts  chocolate chips I have to admit Im crazy about PB  if its not organic then forget it Imagine my surprise when I was told that it was made with organic peanut butterYUM The flavor was packed with PB not so much that it overwhelms you just enough to tantalize your taste buds It was sweet  salty at its best  what can you say about PB  Chocolate 2 tastes that taste great together The Basil Lime Sorbet was super refreshing with a tang of lime perfect for any hot day Im definitely a fan of this place the only downfall for me is that its 800 miles away Stop by this place if youre ever in the neighborhood You wont be disappointed with the varieties of ice cream that they offer  the great service behind the counter,positive,236,200-250,1278,1000-1500

I am writing this about a terrible experience at Venetian on 7142018 We were in Vegas from Chicago for my little sisters 21st birthday party that had been planned months ago My sister is a huge fan of Carlos Bakery and since there is a cake shop in Vegas thought we would surprise her with a Cake Boss cake for her 21st To say I was DISAPPOINTED is a GROSS under statement I preordered 71118 a makeup mania cake Order  154086312 to be ready at 3pm Choose 3pm as we had a a 4course open bar family style SURPRISE dinner with our group of 17 at buca di beppo in Excalibur Jenelle the guest of honor would be ARRIVING at 4pm Arrived at 320p and was SHOCKED to learn cake was NOT READY Supervisor looked surprised we were even there TO MY HORROR AND SHOCK staff STARTED working on cake at 325p Decorations were rushed and fondant was wet uneven smudged Jenelles name was so poorly written could barely make it out Observers were commenting on the poor quality of decorations as my 20568 cake was being made The cake was similar to online picture but some fondant items were completely left off and replaced by random circles to fill up space The tip of the brush had fallen off was on bottom of cake box and I had to pinch it back on myself Her name Jenelle was barely recognizable Manager seemed to be unbothered stated he thought the order was for 4pm which is completely unacceptable Offered a free cappuccino for wait which was a smack in the face The cake was not ready until 4pm My husband and I missed the being there for the surprise at dinner for my only sister Due to the cake be unacceptably frustratingly late we arrived at dinner at 430pm I NEVER would have ever guessed the GREAT Carlos Bakery could drop the ball so bad and present us with such a subpar decorated cake I am absolutely pissed that our over 200 cake from Carlos was so poorly mismanaged and was visibly low quality I have ordered cakes from Jewel that were better decorated and ready for pickup on time Needless to say we HAD to take the cake due to circumstances I had such high expectations of Carlos that were completely shattered Being a fan for so long and FINALLY being able to buy a cake for my sisters surprise 21 st birthday I was mad and let down to the point of tears I WILL NEVER PREORDER A CAKE WITH CARLOS AGAIN AND NEITHER WILL THE 17 PEOPLE THAT WERE THERE TO WITNESS THIS DISASTER ERROR WAS 100 CARLOS BAKERY FAULT AND THE POORLY DECORATED CAKE UNACCEPTABLE I know that Buddy would NEVER allow this to happen I have attached pictures of the cake along with picture of text I sent my mom proving me had missed being there for the 4pm surprise dinner text time in pictures has switched to Central time time in Vegas was 429pm,negative,511,500+,2804,2000+
Amazing ice cream I love discovering good ice cream on college campuses This was by far one of the best It was super creamy and unique I highly recommend you making a stop if youre ever on the UWMadison campus even if you dont have a craving for ice cream The portion is huge for 2 scoops It was totally worth it Book mark it now,positive,66,50-75,341,<500
I believe this might be the one and only cupcake ATM If you know of another please LMK It literally blows my mind when I think about how this multimillion  business rests on a cupcake I am truly truly impressed with Candace Nelson and I frequently watch her judge cupcake wars If I see another candied bacon cupcake GRRRrrrI almost purchased her baking book But really what a treat for the senses here especially the color scheme the bright lights modern decor Am I getting a cupcake or did I stumble into one of those fancy boutiques to get yer herr done I was surprised to receive my birthday cupcake here and also purchased 6 to go and with new puppies on the way of course pupcakes then scoops of ice cream to tide us over until we get back I tried pretty much every cupcake and forgot how dense the frosting is It ends up being my favorite part of the cupcake actually and they do sell frosting shots which I think is just frosting in a cup Since I dabble in baking I pay attention to the taste and aroma of the cupcake itself I found that it has a peculiar after tastescent which reminds me of raw flour Some of the chocolate or PB flavors dont have it as strong Also maybe some sort of cooking oil It is fairly moist I think it is more the experience than anything else keeping in mind it is on the strip or Bev Hills My puppies loved the pup cakes and next time butter pecan scoop Awwww but Sprinkles is my living dreamwhat a gorgeous store,positive,278,250-300,1500,1000-1500

We had a cannoli a mini mouse cake and a nut brownie They were okay nothing fantastic I can make better at home with box mix The brownie was dry and was more cake like It was expensive and I dont think it was worth it There were other bakeries in the Venetian that looked really good I would recommend trying one of them,negative,64,50-75,330,<500
The cotton candy popcorn did not taste at all like cotton candy so disappointed the cheddarmy husband said is not the best hes had he said it was ok Caramel peanutwell I am still looking for the peanuts The cinnamon roll flavor was better than the others but nothing to jump up and down about A little pricey for what it is definitely would not purchase again or recommend Very disappointed in the popcorn and surprised by all the positive reviews The only reason for the two star was fast shipping,negative,91,75-100,510,500-1000
OK this is my first visit here and to be honest I was not really impressed First the area around the bakery is a scary area of town it is absolutely horrible with train tracks and worn down buildings and homes I have been told that NODA is a hipster central but I really do not see it that way it is not swanky at all and its pretty close to central avenue in appearance As far as the bakery goes we had Chesse croissonts apple turnovers and regular croissants and it was just OK There was nothing out of the ordinary with regards to the food we ordered we had a major problem with the lady at the counter as she was giving our order just cold and when I asked her  Are you not going to warm it for us she retorted Oh you want this warmed up as if a cold Croissaont tastes so much better than a warm one Duh Also all our food was served by the server in 1 plate when the order taker knew it was for two and a second empty plate had to be requested The seating here is also limited and it feels very congested as one of the tables next to the ordering counter are in the way of people standing in line to order their food Overall not a pleasant expereince from all the congestion lack of good service from the questions etc and we were not at all impressed Since we live in the North side of town we would certainly not return to this worn down area of town to eat in this not so impressive bakery,negative,282,250-300,1421,1000-1500
Get the crunchy cereal shake My guess is that the negative reviews are for other things Cake as a flavor sounds awful anyway So the crunchy cereal shake Its modestlooking unassuming I dont know why its so good I can talk about individual aspects of it but the combination is bigger than the sum of its parts Its one of those things that you can eat a lot of Not too sweet just the right amount of saltiness to punch up the sweetness and just really gratifying for something that is in the realm of a dessert I think the consistency is perfect too  thick but easy to drink with the fat straw And the crunchy cereal is like the genius part of it Its got the texture and crunchiness of Honey Bunches of Oats with almonds that has been sitting in 2 milk lactose free for the duration of time it takes to eat about 40 of a bowl Sometimes I get impatient and just want to drink the rest of the bowl because I cant spoon it into my mouth fast enough Maybe thats why this shake speaks to me Anyway just get the crunchy cereal shake and you probably wont go wrong Its a bit pricey at around 10 bucks but I think its worth it,positive,220,200-250,1157,1000-1500

If you unfortunately must have lunch at this establishmentget Tiramisu for dessert Im not going to tell you what to get for lunch Theyre not worth mentioning Tiramisu should offer subtle warm sweetness from the Mascarpone cheese and egg cream batch balancing with the right amount of bitterness from espresso in the lady fingers and cocoa powder layer If the cheese layer does not have a tint of yellow that means the recipe removes the egg yolks If using only egg white yes it enables an airy body but its not worth it to lose that warmth that only the yolk renders It should NOT carry any sour taste not even a hint  that means cream cheese is used Cream cheese does not belong in Tiramisu Were not making cheese cake here Whipped cream also should NOT be used Thats just lazy cooks attempt to create the illusion that the body is airy I make Tiramisu at home Whenever there is a potluck occasion the only dish I bring is Tiramisu Hence you can say Tiramisu is the signature dish of my kitchen When I go to Italian restaurants I used to always order tiramisu just so that I can critique it This includes restaurants IN Italy Prestis tiramisu is one of the rare few that reminds me of my own There may be a little variation I dont have electric mixer at home AND I steam bainmarie the raw eggs in case of salmonella so my Mascarpone cheese batch is denser I usually make mine into 2 layers whereas Prestis is one layer For 5 worth of cost mine is six times bigger than Prestis But since I cant feed the whole CLE yelper community with my masterpiece get your fill at Prestis,negative,295,250-300,1628,1500-2000
Worst cupcake I have ever eaten We were in Vegas for a week and this was on my list of places to visit I consider myself a dessert connoisseur and was sad that I was so disappointed I wanted them to be good I had the Valentine trio special It was stale and tasted like purse sugar I have never given just one star but this review was important enough that I do I will not return nor waste my money Feel free to try them for yourself and make your decision as to whether or not they are all theyre hyped up to be,negative,105,100-150,522,500-1000

We decided to visit the Cupcake ATM last night after midnight when they closed just to taste the product and see what it was like We agreed on the cinnamon cupcake After paying the 425 the little door opened and we got our cupcake It was a regular sized cupcake and it had no frosting It tasted like a great BASE for a yummy cupcake with other flavors and frosting but alone it was justcinnamon cake Very disappointed Not worth 425 or even what they charge in store,negative,88,75-100,481,<500

If you want to taste the best ice cream in Charlotte try Jenis This is truly my guilty pleasure I love the smell of the freshly baked waffle cones when you come in the black and white decor with a splash of orange and the variety of ice cream options there are to choose from Fun thing about Jenis is that you can sample as many flavors as you want no questions asked My absolute favorite flavor is the Texas sheet cake Its surprisingly dairyfree and oh so yummy No matter what other flavors I try this one usually makes the cut I love to get a trio and add two flavors that are not my norm along with Texas sheetcake Recently over the holidays they had a whiskey pecan I think and a cognac gingerbread OMG The cognac flavor was everything I even bought a pint to take home I hope that they bring that flavor back next year it was very tasty In the summertime I am pretty much a regular at Jenis I dont see 2020 being any different,positive,182,150-200,965,500-1000
1st time there very very disappointed At the end of the night there were only a few cupcakes there so I went back the next day when they opened Looked like the same cupcakes and same quantity I was mad because I wanted to leave town early but I stayed till 10 to wait for them to open None of the flavors that I wanted were ready so I left with no cupcakes I wonder if they realize that donut shops go in really early to make donuts so when they open the doors they have product to sell I would never waste my time again,negative,106,100-150,528,500-1000

One of Southern Californias best and beloved bakeries meets Sin City Las Vegas Once word got around town that 85 degrees Bakery Cafe was opening up it became an instant hit with lines coming out the door Despite having long lines during certain times of the day it is all worth it in the end I usually get a random assortment of pastries starting with the delicious Ham  Cheese Cheese Dog and Hawaiian Chicken As for the sweet pastries I get the Milk Butter Puff Taro Puff Marble Taro Choco Bun and even the Coffee Milk Butter As for washing it down for coffee I get the Sea Salt Caramel Coffee But I usually go for the Iced Rose Milk Tea Iced Caramel Milk Tea or even the Green Milk Tea There is such a huge assortment of goodies at this bakery that youll find something for everyone when it comes to eating or drinking I definitely recommend this place to anyone from young to older It is very community friendly and very welcoming I go here with my girlfriend and our families 23 times a week We want to try everything and we will continue to come to our favorite bakery,positive,203,200-250,1101,1000-1500

Ive been a loyal customer of this place for years until today Today after school my little girl wanted an ice cream The place was empty and while I was ordering my ice cream my daughter went to the bathroom Even if the place was empty the employee behind the counter was in a rush and in a bad way asked me if I was planning to order anything else I said we will order my daughters ice cream when she got back When she did I placed the order for her and at that moment I step to throw a paper in the garbage 2 seconds literally as more customers started coming in In those 2 seconds he had already put some brittle and a piece of brownie as toppings and I corrected him it was only one topping and in the MOST RUDE WAY he took the cone threw the brownie to the garbage and handed me the cone When I turned to my daughter she had TEARS in her eyes and said Mommy he threw my brownie and I told him I wanted brownies because I already have the brittle I bought a bag of brittle with my order I waited until he was done with the next customer and still politely asked him hey my daughter said she wanted brownies  he turned to me and basically yelled at me your daughter said she wanted 3 toppings I knew she was ordering brownies but also he could have confirmed with me He was so RUDE and my daughter felt so bad she wouldnt even receive the ice cream that the next customer intervened it was his first time at sweet Republic  and said  hey this girl said she wanted brownies could you please change it for her And the RUDE employee turned to the customer and said you need to pay extra This man was so upset that he told ok I will pay for it just give the little girl the brownie At this point I came to the counter thanked the man and told him that was not necessary but he handed 1 to the scooper and asked him to keep the change since he was being so ridiculous and making such a scene in a place now full of customers I asked him for his manager and he put a paper in front of me and in a very defiant way he asked me to write my number and she will call I asked for his name and again using defiant words and tone he handed me the paper on the picture If I want my daughter to have a nice experience definitely I will go somewhere else and not being yelled and embarrassed as she felt today,negative,467,300- 500,2371,2000+
Came here on 0217 with my mom for the first time Upon walking in you grab a tray liner  tongs  pick whatever bread you would like We only grabbed the Brioche  Berrytale The line was pretty long that they had to stop people from coming in until they were able to clear the line They also had a lot of different choices on cakes  boy they all looked so delish But being our first time we didnt want to get too crazy so we paid for our breads  also ordered a slice of the mango creme brulee  a med iced tiger boba latte My mom couldnt wait til we got home to try the mango creme brulee cake so she ended up sitting down  ate it while I was waiting for my drink The tiger latte was a little too sweet for my liking but it was still good Went home tried the Brioche  it was soo good At that moment it was instant regret for not grabbing more than we did because it is such a far drive from Henderson The next day I came home from work looking forward to having some Brioche but I was a little too late My 3 year old had eaten both Brioche  the Berrytale  For a picky eater I sure was shocked she ate it all Looks like well be making another trip this weekend  make sure to grab more than 3 ,positive,252,250-300,1219,1000-1500

Pinkbox is better hands down This place is overpriced and the donuts are mediocre at best I set the standard too high and was expecting Pinkbox quality or better The y taste like they are day old and super dry when you bite into them Its not the price that bothered me as much as it is for the quality for that price My first and last time,negative,68,50-75,346,<500
The donuts itself are phenomenal The fancy ones look great but personally I think it takes away from the donut itself Such as the smores it looks really appealing but the flavor of smores isnt there One would think they would mix marshmallow fluff and graham cracker crumbs with the whipped topping false assumption I have the same issue with the strawberry cream if I were blind I would not know it had strawberries in it Hands down Id go back for the simple and classic donuts As far as I know best donut shop around,positive,96,75-100,541,500-1000
I usually go to the Sprinkles location near my home in Newport Beach When I met with family in Las Vegas I was so excited to show them my favorite cupcake spot I was extremely disappointed with the service we received It was extremely disorganized and the staff seemed too flustered to properly take care of the customers in the store There was no clear line and we were told to wait somewhere else after having stood there for some time The associate took the order of someone who had entered after us and we waited patiently for a cupcake to be brought from the back that associate forget to even give us Im so use to such a great experience at my home location Sad I couldnt show my family that,negative,132,100-150,707,500-1000

My son has a nut allergy We asked the staff to clean one of the ice cream scoopers so we would not have cross contamination The staff and manager said they could not make any special accommodations I will never buy anything else from Ghirardelli again ice cream chocolate Being a national company I thought they would be more accommodating of nut allergies,negative,63,50-75,361,<500

Dear Christina Tosi I watch you judge Master Chef Ive watched documentaries about you which led me to believe you were a world renown first class pastry chef I became a fan Ive been super excited to try your famous cereal milk creations at Milk Barall I can say was it was quite possibly the grossest thing Ive EVER put on my mouth It tasted like a cross between sour and burnt milk I threw my purchase away after three sips the last literally almost came back up What a let down I want my 15 back and I have absolutely zero idea how you ever became rich and famous on such disgustingness Im no longer a fan I literally want to vomit in my mouth thinking about it which almost happened see above honestly doing that would taste better than the stuff I bought at Milk Bar,negative,148,100-150,797,500-1000

Service is really slow We just went to order a cupcake from the bakery case After ordering they put the cupcake on a plate and put it to the side We then waited for over ten minutes to pay while the man behind took additional orders It was particularly annoying because there was no one else waiting in front of us to be rung out The cupcake itself was pretty dry and disappointing not worth the wait,negative,77,75-100,408,<500
Wednesday Aug 8 at 415 We drive to the ice cream shop pay for metered parking walk up and discover it is closed So fun for my three kids This is what summer is all about Closed to prep for a special event No sorrys no coupons to come back and try it again Just a handwritten note and no ice cream How do you expect to earn customers when you randomly close with no notice I understand you have special events but you should offer something to people trying to spend money at your ice cream shop during posted business hours,negative,102,100-150,540,500-1000
I know theyre super busy in the afternoon but everyone was asking if their drink was done or not and they totally forgot about my drink for 20 minutes and didnt even apologize for forgetting about it Usually most companies would upgrade the size as an apology but they just gave me the normal size its super crowded too and for the first time Ive come I realized that im not coming from now on,negative,75,50-75,402,<500

Great pastries and coffee abysmal service 1 Ran out of iced coffee at 851 am 2 Would not honor the 20 coupon we got from eating at Bouchon Bistro We had a big fancy dinner and a big fancy brunch and dropped serious cash there delicious and recommended got a 20 coupon in return And then found out they only honor it at the Clock Tower location Which is garbage 3 Forgot to include butter and jam with my friends bread 4 Generally slow and unorganized I dont expect great service in Vegas but I do expect great service from any Thomas Keller establishment and was sorely disappointed,negative,108,100-150,606,500-1000
Excellent seasonal Pumpkin flavored Macaron which tastes better than the best pumpkin pie youve ever had Texture was perfect and chewy even after carrying it around for hours walking in Nevada heat Their coffee is also pretty incredible smooth not acidic but still bold in flavor They actually run out of their beans sold in their retail shop frequently so grab yourself a bag if in stock Found the coffee bean producers website a hrefredirurlhttp3A2F2Fwwwequatorcoffeescom2Fcoffee2Fequatorrecommends2Fbouchonblendsd824deaaf6aad39b3b05ca692403c0487300e271c08c53c1bfd415a1d1534d1a target_blank relnofollowequatorcoffeescomcoffea where it states Incidentally we find that this coffee compliments the bakerys signature macaron quite well They were correct about that statement,positive,99,75-100,821,500-1000
All of their assorted goods looked very delicious and so creative I marveled and drooled over their individual pastries and beautiful cupcakes I highly recommend the lobster tail It wasnt on display when I was in line and had to order it You bite into a very flaky and crispy outer coating to get an explosion of mildly sweet cream all in your mouth Yes it was quite a beautiful moment The cannoli looked really tasty but I thought it was way too sweet for my liking Overall I think it was worth the wait though it took about 30 minutes but theres just so many things you can choose from to try,positive,113,100-150,610,500-1000
The worst customer service ever I bought 2 scoops of ice cream and asked for it in a cup I asked for a second cup so I can split them between my 2 daughters and offered to pay for the second cup she starts telling me that I have to pay the full price of 2 scoops for the second cup even though its empty What kind of service is that Over priced and not even that good of an ice cream Took her literally 2 min to dig out the ice cream and scoop it out,negative,97,75-100,465,<500

On Saturday 7th 2022 I stopped in about 1  2PM to get coffee with my sister and mother who are from out of town The line was nearly out the door and we looked at each other questioning if waiting would be worth our time I looked around at the fun dÃcor and told my family Amelies is a Charlotte small business worth the experience It took about twenty minutes to get to the counter which we understood given it was your opening weekend in my neighborhood The person at the register was kind and helped us order our coffee They explained if we want pastries then we can pay at the end after we select them People behind us had not ordered coffee so naturally they walked around us to order pastries As we walked in their direction they apologized and said they werent sure what to do We said it was no matter and that they should go ahead We both stood there for several minutes while no one helped or acknowledged us even though we had already paid our drinks were getting cold and we had waited in line nearly half an hour Up until this point everything was acceptable Next an employee directed guests from behind all of us to select pastries I addressed her and inquired if we could go ahead and she dismissed us that someone would be right with us I interposed and asked to be told what the categorical difference was between them and those already in line I asked if they had a different point of origination in the line or if there was some other significant criteria because if not I ask that we be served in order At this point she told me to hurry up and pick something out since Im making a big deal about it I approached the counter and said Im not making a big deal out of it and she interrupted me and said something along the lines of are you going to tell me what you want or keep wasting everyones time I said since Im wasting time let me just ask to see the manager She replied she is the manager I asked for her name My sister asked if someone else can serve us and I simply walked away Put simply at the time I begin my transaction  Im not wasting anyones time because I waited fairly like everyone else Disneyland doesnt rush people through rides faster because they wait in line longer That would be absurd and bad for business In fact they find ways to make the wait more entertaining by putting beautiful flowers all around the guests and have themed characters visiting with children Amelies is the opposite of Disneyland There is no magic there There are so many other places in NoDa and Greater Charlotte that will treat me with respect Rest assured Ill never be back and Ill definitely be sharing this experience with those I care about I cant imagine who would condone that type of communication in a manager and I hope no one else has to be subjected to that disdain and scorn,negative,532,500+,2865,2000+
It doesnt matter what time of the day it is this location is always hopping Thankfully the line moves quick Theres lots of good people watching to be done in south end If you dont know what you want ask for a sample The staff is super patient and they want you to enjoy your decision There are so many wonderful flavors I think mine are the bramble berry and the sweet cream biscuits and peach jam They even have some dairy free flavors I was able to take out for my lactose intolerant mom Her cold brew coffee ice cream was amazing They have seasonal and limited time options as well,positive,112,100-150,598,500-1000
While walking by the Strip weve stopped at the Venetian for lunch and happened to pass by Carlos Bakery I used to walked Cake Boss on TLC so just for nostalgias sake I decided to get some treats here Good I really wanted to say it lives up to the hype but it doesnt If you go during the day the line up is pretty long so go in the evening and youll wait less The service was good and the staff was courteous Location is pretty clean too Bad Ive gotten 2 cannoli one dipped in chocolate and one regular The chocolate one had a dry and waxy taste which wasnt awful but wasnt pleasant neither It just didnt taste fresh Ive had better cannolis from Italian pastry shops back in Montreal At 4 a piece its still pretty hefty for a mediocre pastry Bottom line me thinks not I dont think I would go back and wait in line again The other food didnt look tempting neither so I dont think Id be interested in trying anything else,negative,180,150-200,961,500-1000
I tried 2 items here and was blown away by both of them Item 1 Everything bagel bomb Preface I dont like bagels Why am I even ordering thisoh yeahbecause my friend swears by these things Postconsumption review OMG I LOVE bagels now These are really as good as it gets Its perfectly warm doughy and the inner filling is just out of this world All I can think about now is how I am going to get my next bagel bomb fix since I dont live in Vegas Item 2 Cereal milk icecream Preface I dont drink the milk in my cereal bowel after I eat the cereal WellI didnt like bagels originally and their bagel bomb changed my mind maybe this will too Postconsumption review I did not know that I needed this in my life until now This is just like milk in cereal While milk left over in my cereal bowl is not what I typically crave ever crave this taste is so spot on and intriguing all I want to do is to continue tasting it and marveling at how interesting it is Overall  eating adventures here are a total experience ENJOY even taste items a little outside of your comfort zone,positive,208,200-250,1120,1000-1500
Came in with a few friends have never been here before Hard to spot at night from the street because the sign doesnt light up and the parking lot is dark Super chill spot plenty of seating both inside and out Decent prices good portions and a nice selection of ice creamtoppings I love their name and logo the penguin is awesome so I definitely had to leave with a coffee cup way to upsell me I commented on how slow it seemed when we got there within five minutes there was a line out the door Awesome little spot in the heart of South Scottsdale that didnt disappoint,positive,109,100-150,587,500-1000

After waiting in line for almost an hour the woman behind the counter ignores my 12 yr old who is clearly standing there waiting to order with money in her hand and rudely yells at me to get off my phone and order I point out that she ignored these person trying to order  not even an apology for rudeness We travel to Cleveland every year for the summer and west side market is one of our face places to visit and shop will definitely not be getting any return business from me Worst customer service period They are only getting a 1 star since Yelp requires I select at least 1,negative,113,100-150,589,500-1000

Disclaimer this review is only for the ice cream That being said I gave it an extra  because Im only reviewing a portion of their offerings The milk bar is a walk up dessert shop in the Cosmopolitan If you stop by at any type of popular time theres going to be a wait But to try such unique confections by one of TVs most beloved celebrity chefs Christina Tosi it would be worth it right For the ice cream not so much Milk has three different flavorscereal milk chocolate pretzel and a fruity cereal milk I got cereal milk and chocolate pretzel with chocolate topping A small was 6 it wasnt a huge amount for the price but it would be enough for one or two people to share Or even 20 because once I had a few bites I went from being intrigued to really put off The pros The consistency is perfect You can tell its a high quality soft serve The staff is nice The cons The descriptions are 100 what youre getting The cereal milk ice cream tastes like cereal milk And not cookie crisp cereal milk but some kind of cardboard healthy cereal And the chocolate pretzel was the sameit was extra pretzelly not enough chocolatey Overall my biggest problem was there wasnt enough sweetness to itit really just tasted like creamy versions of the flavors The chocolate topping for 1 extra wasnt hot fudgey and it wasnt saucey it was weird and almost taffylike I wanted to try one of their cake or pie offerings but they were just way too expensive for me to justify spending on dessert Next time Im in Vegas and have a hankering for ice cream idk where Ill go but I wont be visiting Milk again,negative,300,250-300,1650,1500-2000
I had quite high expectations for this place because my mom and I always watched his show every single episode I was excited to find out that there was one in Vegas and we were visiting soon I told my fiancÃ all the great things about this place that they would have from watching the show We got there and there was a small short line The taking order lines and paying lines are separate and theyre both not the greatest and should be reorganized again There was no number or anything its more of whoever the worker sees first they will ask them what they want Youll then proceed to tell them what you want and theyll take your name down They will then tell you to go to the back of the other line until its your turn to pay when youre called to We got the regular cannoli and chocolate dipped onesbeing that on the show its always talked about one of the best sellers at the bakery We also got a strawberry shortcake parfait or something I dont know exactly because the employees did not know themselves what it was called There was also barely any labels for the items so you just point and they have to follow your finger to figure out what you want because nobody knows the names of things or what some items are called The displays of pastries were definitely pretty and well put together but it wasnt full Half the pastry display was emptied and it was a little after 1pm We placed our orders and went to the other line and waited until they called us to pay Odd Well we waited and waited 15 minutes later when everyone ahead of us left and new people were behind us still not called My fiancÃ went to ask and all we got was oh what is your name We told them and they said they couldnt find it then asked if we forgot to order No We flagged the girl down who took our order and asked for his name She replies oh here it is I just forgot your name No apologies no nothing Received an over pricednot a big deal since we expect to be paying over priced box full of pastriesdessert that was half melted We asked if we could get a fresh one since things were half melted sitting there when they forgot our names and didnt bother to ask again until we came up to them They just said no sorry and we were on our way Well I was excited to try out the desserts any way since I expected it to be great Well I shouldnt have Everything was just mediocre Cannolis were not fresh it was stale The filling was just okay I had better cannolis from Wegmans bakery section The so called strawberry shortcake parfait that they dont know the name of was a mess in a cup It looked like a mess and it tasted like store bought Sucks because again this place is well known for many things and maybe its just the location and the employees but I wouldnt recommend it We will try again but the original shop in the future,negative,545,500+,2872,2000+

I have no idea why this place has so many good reviews I went there last night for first time and had two scoops with some toppings and it was damn near 10 That is EXTREMELY over priced The ice cream was just ok And I really do mean just ok The toppings didnt seem to have much flavor except the salted caramel sauce The salt flavor was WAY to strong It overwhelmed everything else I did have a snicker doodle cookie on top which was very good The service was excellent and very helpful which is the reason for the two stars I dont believe I will be coming back Ice cream should NEVER be this expensive Ice cream is mostly milk and sugar Two things I dont remember being overly pricy,negative,133,100-150,706,500-1000
I hate to say it because Im a big fan of the Cake Boss show but I was pretty disappointed I had a cannoli and it just tasted burnt and way to heavy and sweet Also there was a very long line that moved super slow Perhaps some other desserts are better but I would not waste time trying this place again,negative,62,50-75,307,<500
Very disappointed Ive been to the Amelies uptown and had a totally different experience This one was dirty and disorganized Trash on the floor and no workers around to help with anything Our sandwiches were good but the ambiance and service ruined our experience Who is running this place I could understand if they only served coffee but serving food without decent service or someone cleaning the table and floors makes no sense This location does have parking but I definitely will not return,negative,84,75-100,508,500-1000

Ice cream is good but not worth the wait Everytime my husband and I go there is a line of about ten people and one maybe two employees working This evening sealed the deal that we will not be going back This is the third time we stepped out of line to grab ice cream elsewhere This makes me sad only because I worked at the one in Ohio when I was in high school On summer nights we had every window open with limited line waits Customer service is something this location may want to think about improving Gotta spend the money to make the money,negative,107,100-150,554,500-1000

Ive heard all the raves and was anxious to try Sprinkles cupcakes Once the newness of Linq wore off a bit Frank and I went over to see what all the fuss has been about My husband is a sucker for Red Velvet so his choice was easy I on the other hand wasnt in the mood for anything in particular I asked which was their best seller Red Velvet Ok second best Chocolate Marshmallow Sold Most if not all cupcakes are 375 each The Red Velvet fell flat The frosting was too sweet and the cake was dry The Chocolate Marshmallow was the better choice but it was still pretty dry even with the marshmallow center and I hated the rock hard candy placed on top Ive had better and Ive had worse but I wont be singing any praises for Sprinkles Cupcakes,negative,144,100-150,771,500-1000

Ive never had donuts even close to as good as what you get at Jack Frost The donuts themselves always have just the right texture consistency and flavor Whether its a glazed or a cake donut youre getting something topnotch And then theres the different toppings I could talk about many of them but do yourself a favor and get the donut with both the white and chocolate cream I wish they sold that stuff in a tub so I could just go at it with a spoon Plus despite the fact theyre often busy the service is always excellent I go there every other week or so with my son before school and theyre always so nice to him and half the time they give him his donut for free which I never ask them to do Just an excellent oldschool Cleveland institution,positive,144,100-150,772,500-1000

I have had the birthday cake the crack pie and a few different cookies all were super yummy Keep in mind that its dessert its going to be sweet There seem to be a lot of complaints on here about it being too sweet So get a cup of coffee to help wash down the sweetness and to give yourself the PG version of the Fear  Loathing experience fueled by sugar and caffeine I had a mild issue on one of my visits and the customer service was outstanding that and the yummy cake is a sure 5 star experience in my eyes,positive,104,100-150,524,500-1000

Eeww Very hot day and no indoor dining  even limited due to current COVID guidance Air conditioning Outdoor area filthy with trash birds and flys Waaay over priced for the quality of food and a limited selection of patisserie for midday  especially for a French bakery Rule of thumb in food service industry is that the last person in line should have the same choices as the first person in line Go ahead and pass this one by Again eewww,negative,82,75-100,457,<500

I have been wanting to try this place for months now so I decided to try it one Friday night I am not sure if that was a great idea being the line was out the door The place is super small on the inside They only were serving shakes no bowls I was so determined to try this place I waited over 30 minutes in line There were some people who waited out line but there were many that left because it was taking so long There was only two people working inside One on the register and one making shakes For a Friday night I am not sure if that was to smartest plan because it looks like the weekends are busy days I will say that my shake was really good I not for sure if Ill wait that long again for it 30 minutes is just way to long If you have patience I would suggest going to try it out if not maybe weeknights are better nights to go,positive,174,150-200,851,500-1000
Dont want to go to the restaurant but still want a chocolate croissant Well here you go After walking off our brunch we headed here for a snack to go as we made our way back to LA I got my requisite croissant but what caught my eye is their homemade nutter butters Which are really two large cookies with a creamy peanut butter filling Basically a large peanut butter cookie sandwich which tastes just like a Nutter Butter Bouchon youve proven your worth You know your pastries and I will be back to put more of them in my mouth,positive,101,100-150,542,500-1000
I loved this place Came here late night with gf and as a visitor was surprised to see that we had about 30 people ahead of us in line However the decor  spirit of the place gave you that dont worry be happy feeling Plus it went extremely fast If youve never been it is a must Im not a coffee drinker but I just had to try to cafe matteriuer sp Goodness  Carmel sauce sea salt and vanilla bean Accompanied by the sea salt caramel brownie Between the coffee and brownie  my palate was happy Delectable They have an assortment of desserts You will fall in love with the cozy ambiance which is welcoming to Everyone Good service as well Open 247 who can beat that I wish you were on the west coast Amelies,positive,139,100-150,737,500-1000

As a cakecupcake caterer I like to try my competition to see what Im up against I have considered Buddy more than competition since hes way out of my league however after tasting 3 different cupcakes SMores chocolate wvanilla buttercream and vanilla wchocolate buttercream I am completely underwhelmed The cake was good nothing out of the ordinary but the buttercream was no better than what I could get at my local Safeway Shortening based buttercream Seriously Bleh Also the SMores cupcake was the same vanilla with chocolate buttercream only they charge 1 more to add some broken graham crackers on top Zero marshmallow anywhere on or in the cupcake How can you call it SMores without marshmallow The only reason Im giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the cannoli It was good They ought to use the filling to frost their cupcakes Overall impression pretty on the outside but overpriced and bland on the inside just like Vegas,negative,161,150-200,983,500-1000
This place is a scam It was almost 6 for a kids scoop of ice cream My daughter said the ice cream wasnt even that good I was kinda annoyed my wife even bought it I wished she walked out Avoid this dump,negative,43,25-50,209,<500

They believe 85 Celsius is the best temperature for brewing coffee How interesting and scientific I love this bakery I visited one in Pasadena in the past Their pastries are affordable presentable and flavorful They offer nice variety of pastries as well as cake desserts I also tried their house coffee which was light and smooth Their house coffee comes with sugar and cream automatically so if you dont want sugar or cream make sure you tell them so Customer service is also excellent here They have sitting area available,positive,90,75-100,538,500-1000
Sorry not sorry but not worth the hype Maybe take this with a grain of salt as Im not the biggest fan of sweetsdesert places but even I can appreciate some good sweets when given Unfortunately Milk Bar does not live up to the expectations and for the price you pay I didnt see it worthwhile There are a lot of dessert places offthestrip that are better and way worth the price Overall Milk Bar is overpriced which is something to expect being on the strip I just didnt feel like the value of the treats I got were worth the monetary value So I did the Greatest Hits combo which was a little over 20 for their best treats It came with  compost cookie  255 Was okay I kept eating it but couldnt figure out if I liked it or not yep one of those  slice of crack pie 15 I didnt particularly like this  bday truffles 55 i really liked these pretty good i definitely needed a drink to counteract the sweetness of this though this was my favorite and id opt to get these again if i came across it  cereal milk soft serve 45 really cool concept actually just tastes like corn flakes with milk not sure if id pay for it because it wasnt anything unique,negative,226,200-250,1195,1000-1500
I went in with a 5 birthday coupon and the cashier named Audrey didnt know how to enter the coupon so she gave us under the amount off instead They accepted no fault and blamed it instead upon the fact that they werent taught how to enter the coupon and were very rude when confronted and unhappy Very unprofessional experience,negative,60,50-75,336,<500
The food is great The line is awful I am currently in my second half hour waiting for a turkey and bacon croissant I have finished my coffee and all the pastries that we got from the counter and still not gotten my warmed sandwich from the back This would be a great place if it wasnt so crowded and the service wasnt so slow,negative,65,50-75,332,<500
What 7 bucks for a non special super small milkshake Went to Gordon burger joint got a milkshake which was way better way bigger and for the same price Step your game up Cant believe this place has business since its so simple Could get a better shake from any fast food joint Pass this place up,negative,57,50-75,305,<500
Fresh dairy ice cream so delightful it coats your mouth with a sweet cream taste and the waffle cones are thick enough to have a bit of crunch as well as sweet softness you can chew just enough to be satisfying Reminds me of Oberweis from Illinois,positive,47,25-50,250,<500
Went to see what all the hype was about Only a few flavors available Got a two scoop of chocolate and get figgy with it Cost close to 900 for two scoops no toppings Im all about supporting local businesses but feel this place is a little over priced for what you get Quality was okay as was customer service,negative,60,50-75,318,<500
This was a little kiosk behind the escalator It doesnt offer any seating which seemed odd to me We got green tea but I think they gave us Earl Gray We also purchased a Buchon which is a brownie bite Good service reasonable prices for Vegas but no need to go back,negative,52,50-75,269,<500
This is a must see when in Vegas Found this place just by chance while charging the car The overall vibe gives the local feel but with a new twist I had the Mexican chocolate donut and was not disappointed,positive,40,25-50,209,<500
This cupcake place simply sucks You have to wait to get in but once you taste the cupcakes they are horrible The cake has no flavor and lacks something The toppings make it appealing until you taste the whole cupcake I tossed the cupcake I bought for lack of flavor my kids also got rid of theirs,negative,57,50-75,303,<500
Not the same as it used to be Although the new owners were nice it was very disappointing I hadnt been in a few months trying to eat better and for the same price as the original fatty daddy I got a few tiny scoops of ice cream and one cookie The original fatty daddy was so huge you could share it Im glad I got to experience the real thing when it first opened Im not sure Ill ever go back Time to find a new ice cream joint,negative,90,75-100,440,<500
Came into Amelies around 8 am with a slow crowd ordered 3 quiche to go I waited about 1015 min for them to be heated and upon delivery 1 was served with a dark brown burnt top I returned the burnt quiche and proceeded to wait an additional 10 min As a restaurant industry vet its highly disappointing to see that type of neglect when there are 3 customers in the cafe Will only be returning if I have 40 min to spare,negative,83,75-100,424,<500
This was my first time trying the soft serve ice cream and the shake Both tasted sour and spoiled and made me sick I wasnt sure if it was supposed to taste like that or not Super unfortunate for how much Ive heard good reviews from this place,negative,48,25-50,248,<500
Generous serving of halo halo and friendly staff There are 2 selections of halo halo with one containing more ingredients than the other I got the one with more ingredients and honestly cant tell what all of them are Seems like there was a variety of beans and jellies in addition to coconut shavings ice cream and flan Overall it tasted good as it was not too sweet and had a lot of substance,positive,74,50-75,401,<500
Churn is my goto ice cream shop in the Phoenix area I think it has been well over a year since Ive gone to ice cream anywhere else First without even bringing up how good the actual product isthe ambiance is top notch Its a tiny shop but its attached to Windsor and has a nice little patio in the back nice meaning notatallnice in the months of June July August or Septemberand most of October PS For all the Phoenicians who say the unbearable heat only lasts 3 monthsyou are full of sht It hits 100 in May and Ive seen triple digits all the way in to November ANYWAY back to the ice cream My favorite flavors are the Butter Pecan sweet and salty gets me every time Toasted Coconut and Peanut Butter  Jelly when they have it I normally just go with a scoop in a cup because the ice cream is that good that I think it is better off standing alone However if you want to get fancy Id recommend an ice cream cookie sandwich You can mix and match cookies and it makes for the perfect shareable dessert The people who work there are awesome too You know how some people get super annoyed when you ask for tons of samples At Churn they dont In fact in addition to ice cream samples they give you brownie and cookie samples as well If you arent an ice cream kinda person who isnt though there are a ton of candies and fun toys in the shop as well But really when ice cream is on the table theres really no other option,positive,278,250-300,1481,1000-1500
Bad experience I went in with a few friends and ordered the three cinnamon pull apart breads asked to have it heated up  it was not heated up to par It was warm on the outside but cold inside just like my exgf the glaze was like a jolly rancher feel We asked for them to reheat it and they refused to take it back once it left the counter we would have to purchase another one totally not the way to run a business,negative,86,75-100,431,<500
We were so excited to finally try out this Italian bake shop but we were really let down First its a very cute simple little shop with lots of parking and some picnic tables for outside munching which I think is great Inside is crampedno biggie though Next the staff were adequately pleasantnothing to write home about They took our order packed everything nicely and took the payment But the food was subpar This is not our first foray into Italian pastriesin NY they rule the pasty scene and everything they make is amazing Not here I noticed all croissants lobster tails cream horns and such were far too overcookedreally dark to nearly burnt on top This really ruins it for me But heres what we order Lobster tail Yes despite the above comment about being overcooked I ordered 2 because I love them I could not eat nearly half of the pastry because it was so hard from being nearly burned but the cream filling is out of this world amazing Sfingi The pastry part of these is done very nicely but the filling was lumpy barely sweetened and had a strong almond flavor Tiramisu Probably the worst weve had The filling is more like a pudding its supposed to be primarily mascarpone the lady fingers were dry and there was no hint of the lady fingers having been soaked in coffee or rum or anything like that Quite a disappointment as tiramisu is my husbands favorite Napoleon The pastry layers were barely cooked and were the consistency of barely baked pie crust kinda chewy Its supposed to be made with puff pastry and there was zero puff going on The filling was again more like a pudding consistencyits supposed to be a pastry cream Very disappointing Overall disappointing I didnt expect to love everything but I thought it would be reasonable to expect something to be great Too bad,negative,321,300- 500,1859,1500-2000
Milk tea had a familiar proper black milk tea flavor but it was too sugary Crepes held together matcha ice cream and red bean had good flavor Could use more red bean paste in the crepe Crepe batter was basic but tasty Service was good and there were a couple tables to sit down at I would come back for their crepes and try the milk tea at half sugar,positive,70,50-75,358,<500
Nothing noteworthy at all really dont know how this place was rated so high Atmosphere okay service okay ice cream Just okay,negative,22,<50,133,<500
My continuing mission to discover nondairy ice creams Ice dessert in Las Vegas has brought me to Handels The mission is also to pursue those icy sweet indulgences while preserving my fragile digestive system This time mission was a success Handels has three nondairy options 1 Coconut 2 Watermelon Ice and 3 Mango They are all distinctly fantastic Three options may seem measly but this is the most Ive seen in a ice cream shop thus far Coconut is my favorite fruit messing it up would have instantly made the mission a presumptive failure Luckily Handels coconut ice cream blew me out of the water The coconut was not overpoweringly sweetsomething I value highly The coconut flavor was subtle just like a real coconut More impressive was the soft coconut flesh hidden in the ice cream they added some welcoming texture which also retained the flavor a bit longer in the mouth once the cream portion happily melts away Needlessly to say Handles coconut ice cream was a resounding victory The Watermelon Ice flavor was equally impressive As the name suggests this is just ice with presumably watermelon juice The lack of creamy taste is a refreshing contrast to the coconut Again no overpowering sugar taste here each spoonful filled with potent watermelon flavor The texture is soft but does not have that sandy texture most shaved ice have It almost feels like crushed watermelon flesh Pretty cool I only had a little bit of the mango because I am just not a big fan of the fruit However I will not be hesitant to recommend the mango flavor to those who love mangoIt had the same great attributes the coconut flavor had My mission to discover nondairy ice desserts continues on but it could have ended with Handels If you miss out on ice cream because of dairy Handles got you covered,positive,313,300- 500,1841,1500-2000
It was a very bad experience I asked for two hot cocoa and it was hot water The service was bad no interest to do arrangements or even try to provide a service Ive get there at 1130 they took 30 minutes in our beverage and it was the time to close They were only trying to get us out of there when we tasted it it was hot water We came back and they were close and no intentions to Open and see what happened I definitely not recommend this place,negative,92,75-100,455,<500
because thomas keller in little doses never disappoints oddly enough im was disappointed at the size of their cupcakes it was too big too american too tacky for the food that he actually serves but in any case the chocolate cupcake was good it had a chocolate mousse filling inside and a marshmallowy icing but the croissants ah its always worth the calories and the crumbs that end up on your shirt as i said in my bouchon bakery ny review  hello croissants i love you,positive,87,75-100,487,<500
I cannot rave about this place enough We went on a Sunday morning to pick up some breakfast pastries It was a quaint and small shop but the selection of baked goods was out of this world We were so tempted to get everything from the pastries to the cakes to the macaroons but forced ourselves to just stick with the chocolate croissant and the very berry muffin These did not disappoint The chocolate croissant was massive yet I still could have eaten more because it was so good It was so flaky and had the perfect amount of chocolate it in The muffin too was the perfect texture and bursting with a rich berry flavor The only bad thing about this place is there isnt anywhere to sit inside so you can continue to enjoy the delicious smells of the bakery,positive,142,100-150,766,500-1000
I love the stores in SoCal particularly the one on Alton Pkwy This store however leaves a lot to be desired I have been here many times over the past year I keep telling myself to give them time with it being their first year and all After that I would say oh its just the pandemic impacting their operations After today I am done making excuses for this locations poor communication poor product quality and poor customer service Arrived at a bit after 10 AM No signs on door or modified hours listed for July 4th I was advised to return at noon I came back to discover only half the selection of SoCal locations Plenty of workers moving slowly and not restocking the limited selection very efficiently Despite all the visits to this location still no egg tarts I can understand rotating product but how on Earth do you not keep your core product available so frequently I was excited to find some berry tales available only to be sabotaged upon looking insideabsolutely no filling Ordered a couple of sea salt iced coffees only to discover it tasted watered down and contained about a third of the coffee jelly we receive at other locations Only two sips worth of jelly I still love the brand and the SoCal locations However this location should be renamed to a much lower temperature to reflect what they actually excel ina universally substandard experience from product quality product availability and customer service,negative,250,200-250,1460,1000-1500
995 for 6 small donuts So sad its come to this Must be some expensive whip creme on top of these Hadnt been here in years before they became designer donuts Dont think Ill be back,negative,36,25-50,190,<500

Ive only ever visited Prestis Bakery for breakfast which I think is why my opinion is in conflict with so many other reviews They specialize in sweet pastry items and havent mastered the other options on their menu quite yet  Food  I ordered the Sausage Breakfast Sandwich which is a croissant with egg American cheese and sausage I honestly wouldnt have been surprised if everything other than the croissant was from the Jimmy Dean freezer section The cheese wasnt melted the egg was burning hot in some places and freezing cold in others and the sausage was noticeably dry This dish was clearly microwaved despite the fact that I ordered just 20 minutes after the store opened It was a little over 5 which just doesnt seem right for something reheated My friends ordered a breakfast sandwich and French toast and had a similar opinion of the food This is the first time Ive ever seen my friend not finish a meal The French toast had sesame seeds in it which leads me to believe it was just bread they werent able to sell the day before  Drinks  The restaurant boasts a large espresso and coffee menu However their customization options are abysmal For example the only milk options are whole milk or soy I ordered the mocha and couldnt finish it It was unnaturally sweet and served with sticky canned whipped cream running down the side of the cup  Service  No table service Service is typical of a bakery you order at the front wait for your order to be filled then you can take a seat if youre eating in When I arrived my three friends and I were the only patrons in the bakery and they had already ordered There were two people working the counter but they were handling orders separately and not working together The man who took my order took nearly 10 minutes to make a mocha and microwave the breakfast sandwich I mentioned previously He seemed to be annoyed to be at work and was very short with me and uninviting Not impressed  Stars  Service 01 Stars Food 02 Stars Drinks 02 Stars,negative,368,300- 500,2069,2000+
I have tried to go to this bakery for years and everytime I visited the line was crazy This week however there was no line so I decided to have a taste I had the hazelnut croissant and a brownie with pecans and caramel For a bakery with such hype I was sadly disappointed in the quality The croissant was over stuffed with hazelnut cream so it ended up oozing everywhere The brownie also had only a couple of nuts on top with a little drizzle of caramel The actual brownie was more like cake than a brownie,negative,98,75-100,514,500-1000
The staff here is extremely slow The product is good tasting as usual but these girls have to pick up the speed I waited 45 minutes to get an ice cream cone for my daughter with only six people in front of us One of the girls which Im assuming was a manager kept going in and out asking us to move to the side so that she can clean the windows when she should have been serving customers They were very nice as soon as we finally reached the counter But I saw a lot of people get in line and then leave because the wait was just too long and we all couldnt figure out why I know thats not very good for business,negative,126,100-150,627,500-1000
This place is dope not many 24 hour spots Great food deserts and drinks and Thomas is off the chain He made us feel at home and had great recommendations that were all incredible You definitely need to check this place out especially if your a night owl Cheers,positive,49,25-50,260,<500
Do NOTI repeat do NOT get the grapefruit tequila sorbet unless you really want to relive your college days of waking up with the taste of vomit in your mouth Truthfully The rest of the ice cream was soso but sadly underwhelming Try the ice cream flight if you cant make up your mind  its a good amount of ice cream for the price The street was unlit and a little shady Not a place to come if youre not familiar with the area,negative,85,75-100,440,<500
Red Velvet Cupcake  its been years but I remember being quite impressed considering its not one of my favorite flavors in general Pumpkin Cupcake  The cake was light not too moist not too dry and it was perfectly spiced The cream cheese icing was delicious Only complaint  not enough icing They should put some inside Captain Crunch Ice Cream  It has a light cereal flavor and great texture due to the bits of cereal mixed in I will definitely be coming back for this one,positive,89,75-100,487,<500
Let me start off by saying I think that my bad experience may be based on how busy they were The parking lot was packed After ordering I tried to find somewhere to sit I finally found a place in the atrium Unfortunately it was too far away to use their wifi After waiting about 20 minutes on my food I decided to get it to go instead The girl at the counter was very pleasant and helpful in getting it changed over As soon as I got to outside I realized the cup of soup was spilling in the bag Btw it was portobello  onion the mushroom seemed like an afterthought in decent french onion soup I then noticed that the full sandwich I paid for looked very smallthey only gave me 12 of my full sandwichthe pieces didnt match based on the diagonal cut At this point I didnt feel like even going back in to deal with the missing half sandwich Im sure someone in the kitchen enjoyed it I liked my half of the turkey and brie Ill probably go back but not if they are packed,negative,192,150-200,994,500-1000
Horrible 400 PM NO donuts with no more expected out for the day One employee took a donut back from a lady that brought it back to the store and then put it back on the shelf and then another employee gave it to me Not expected to close until 8 pm Tremendous increase in price since moving into their new building apparently,negative,63,50-75,332,<500
A gem in Champaign This space is so lovely and I was surprised to see that they sell cute stationary in addition to amazing baked goods Its not a huge space and I personally wouldnt come here to study and chill for a long time However I would stop by to have a latte and share a dessert with a friend I just wish they stayed open later Came for 1 macaron Wednesdays and was not disappointed Also ordered the mini Oreo cheesecake which was rich and delicious,positive,88,75-100,471,<500
This is the only place I get ice cream So yummy with creative flavors every time There is normally a line in the summer sometimes its pretty long You can taste anything you want in the case Serving sizes are just right,positive,42,25-50,225,<500
Whenever I come to Vegas I stop by to buy cupcakes but this time the employee Margarita was so rude when she attended me and I told the cashier and she said she is a new employee and she doesnt know and I preferred to keep quiet How sad that a place that is sweet the employees are so rude Buddy I was disappointed in the customer service,negative,68,50-75,341,<500
We went in there tonight and I have to say it is the best ice cream I have ever had Got the Elvis ice cream donut and my god was it good Here for a couple more days and gonna try to go back and get another one Tried some of the other flavors and they were all good too If you are in the area you have to stop in,positive,71,50-75,316,<500

The cupcakes we had were delicious We tried red velvet strawberry and dark chocolate  all were well worth it Better yet the customer service was top notch The staff were very pleasant assisted us with our decisions as there were plenty of choices and they definitely went above and beyond to make us feel welcome If you happen to be current or former military they also show their support with Veterans Day deals which is much appreciated We will be back for more,positive,84,75-100,476,<500
I was a bit surprisedselection was limited a bit Safeway sh if that makes senseI wouldnt go back actually Not much to select as far as cakes go and didnt seem very Italian either Disappointing,negative,35,25-50,208,<500
I absolutely love Handels I always come with my friends I have been here 3 times already and the quality is consistent I love the four scoop sampler because it is cheap and gives me a variety The birthday cake flavor is rich and tastes exactly like its supposed to The cookies and cream has Oreos inside and you can definitely taste the flavors My favorite is the cotton candy because they perfectly capture it in an ice cream The strawberry cheesecake is also delectable because there are little cheesecake bites within it,positive,93,75-100,533,500-1000
This place seems overrated to me When I walked in the employee just stared at me without saying anything No exaggeration It was strange to say the least Well there were many many options which is where they get positive points Youre bound to find something you likewhile the employee stares at you from the other side of the freezer I tried both the Zanzibar chocolate and the peanut butter cookie dough The Zanzibar was very smooth while the peanut butter cookie dough waa just too icey and hard for my liking I opted for a chocolate dipped bowl and I added cookie and it came up to be 580 Okay we are talking pretty expensive for one scoop of ice cream and cookie dough powder Yeah you read that right Look at the photo below they literally put the bottom of the barrel of cookie on my ice cream and asked me to pay six bucks for it Not impressed at all The employees sit on a chair behind the counter while there is grubby stuff all over the floor Would not recommend to those that frequent good quality ice cream shops,negative,193,150-200,1055,1000-1500
Omg The best ice cream ever Get the four scoop sampler because its too hard to decide on just one flavor Now I know what youre thinking the four scoop Oh thats too much I really shouldnt Yes you should So many flavors you have to try each one because even though you have probably had mint chocolate chip ice cream before youve never had it like this And you HAVE to have the buckeye The ice cream is so creamy and rich its hard to resist licking the plastic container your four scoops of deliciousness comes in and ok I almost did lick the container when I was done but a stranger wouldve seen me my brother and sister in law would have to but they would understand and not judge me Regular ice cream will never be the same,positive,141,100-150,752,500-1000

This place is pretty decent The toppings are good quality and the prices arent bad The weirdest thing about them is that their custard has no eggs in it to me eggs are what make custard custard so thats odd but it still tastes good,positive,45,25-50,241,<500
Very cheap but even more so delicious I had a coffee toffee milkshake with a scoop of birthday cake and on top of that the man asked me if I wanted my straw dipped in chocolate and the answer to that was of course YES This was the most delicious shake I have ever had plus I got three chocolates with it that were also amazing and in the end it was only six dollars crazy right,positive,77,75-100,381,<500
They make up hours as they go Kind of disappointing for kids who waited all day to go to have these random evening closures No announcement on socials or even website Wouldnt be more than bummed but they were super rude about it at the door too like were supposed to just know Wont be back I wont be recommending it either World doesnt revolve around me but I consider a being kind and following your own operating hours to be pretty basic tenants of business,negative,86,75-100,471,<500
This was my go to place for breakfast everyday when I was visiting Vegas for few days I really love their coffee and pastries On the last day of my stay I went there to pick up some macarons to bring home and as usual there was a long line I really didnt mind to wait When I got back to the hotel room which was upstairs I quickly realized one of the macarons was not what I ordered And i was also being charged for extra macaron on the receipt I went downstairs again and told the lady at the shop about that She raised her voice and said thats what I ordered I further explained maybe because I was wearing a mask and it was loud in the surrounding inside a hotel and casino and there were many people she may not heard it right But I would like to exchange to the one I wanted She gave me such a dirty look and was continuing accused me thats what I ordered I politely told her I would like to make it right to what I have ordered I further explained I was being charged extra and she looked at me like I took my macaron out and came back demanding for the refund for ONE macaron Making it in a scene and everyone in line was looking at me Really This is the most ridiculous thing I ever experienced in a cafe like that,negative,247,200-250,1247,1000-1500

The worst service ever  the food was not bad but the attitude of the manger moe is awful she is totally out of place with her actions and the way she treats and talks down to customers just plan rude A paying customer deserves respect  maybe she should fine a different line of work,negative,56,50-75,290,<500
This bakery is just a little togo place in the middle of the Venetian hotel They are separate from the Bouchon restaurant which is upstairs Their selection is limited unlike their other bakery in Napa However I make good use of their daily selection of macarons croissants and pastries The macarons are huge but their selection is limited with just the basic flavors When you do have a chance to go to Napa pls stop by their bakery there I love their seasonal flavors and my favorite was the Cherry Cheesecake macaron and Monkey Bread The male barista during my visit was a bit overwhelmed I ordered chai tea to go and he made me 3 lol Then he had to deal with the British couple after me who were angry at him for not allowing them to pay through their hotel bill WTF Poor guy Anywho their croissants are pretty good and I always order a box to go for my grandma It can get pretty pricey as these are artisanal baked goods and hand crafted pastriesand of course its Thomas Keller,positive,183,150-200,1008,1000-1500
The Butterwood Bake ambiance was soothing and cute No strong lights makes it sort of romantic too That is not why I ended up there The reason was the cakes and they delivered  peach custard was almost naughty so creamy and delicious The pear cake was a pleasant surprise  I did not expect a burst of flavor that I got I felt in love with it and I wanted the feeling to last longer but all I got now is a nice memory so I will have to go back to get more of the same A confirm a few previous reviews saying that the girl at counter was nice,positive,112,100-150,552,500-1000
Nice staff at the counter large selection of drinks and yummy looking goodies cute ambiance The greatest downfall and why Ill never return Got three quarters of the way done with my pastry salted brownie which was great until I took one of the last few remaining bites and proceeded to pull a long dark hair from my mouth YUP I found a hair in my food My hair is blonde and short Twas not mine I was mortified Sorta wanted to puke My first and last visit Though Im sure it hasnt happened that much before,negative,97,75-100,529,500-1000
Excellent food excellent staff got the lemon basil sorbet and was blown away by how lemony and delicious they were able to get it Id rate this the best ice cream Ive ever had,positive,34,25-50,177,<500
very disappointed about the quality of pastry vs price Im a well traveled man and a foodie the only good thing about this place is the convenience of staying open 247,negative,31,25-50,171,<500
Yummy yummy this is so brilliant A scoop of ice cream with toasted mallow I had a kids scoop of banana ice cream and a toasted mallow on top it literally just melted in my mouth And actually a kids scoop was good enough for me to have it at night the flavor wasnt too artificial so it was good They have a variety of flavor options which made me a little difficult to make a choice Anyways they also open til 930pm so if you are craving something sweet at night this is the place,positive,96,75-100,493,<500
After being gone from the Las Vegas scene for a few years I was amazed at how many new celebrity owned restaurants had popped up My boyfriend and I both have huge sweet tooths and knew that we wanted to visit Carlos bakery before we left Vegas We had heard that the lines for this place tended to be long but when we went mid morning it wasnt too bad I think we waited for about 20 minutes The staff here were friendly and fast They also didnt rush the customers giving you plenty of time to look through all of the bakery cases We wanted to try everything but ended up choosing a few treats instead We ordered the glazed donut carrot cupcake cannoli sugar cookie chocolate chip cookie and the mm cookie Honestly nothing tasted as good as we were expecting We ended up spending almost 20 here and the only thing worth mentioning was the glazed donut The cupcake tasted frozen and all of the cookies were dry and hard We were definitely let down,negative,178,150-200,965,500-1000
Great tasting ice cream BUT expensive 1 cone 450 The vegan option was a giant glop of slush Nothing like ice cream at all and Ive had a lot of vegan ice cream Disgusting Only a super small amount of flavors to choose from,negative,44,25-50,230,<500
I get to Vegas about once each year and we always stay downtown I had seen Donut Bar on Instagram one day when I was getting excited about my trip I decided to follow them for a while and after dreaming about their donuts for months we mad it in This place does not disappoint The service was helpful and friendly Come hungry The donuts are massive My hubby got the CrÃme brÃlÃe a yeast donut and I had a cake donut called a buttermilk it was covered with some type of chocolate ganache My husband decided to order Nitro cold brew coffee Everything was delicious Its not cheap food at all but everything was so well made and delicious its worth the expense My donut was crispy on the outside light and cakey on the inside and the chocolate was the exact right amount of sweet My husbands was just like CrÃme brÃlÃe It had s nice crack on the outside and delicious vanilla custard inside You could even see the Vanilla bean speckles There is a small sitting area outside with adirondack chairs This is a must visit and lives up to the Instagram photos Totally worth the check in,positive,202,200-250,1111,1000-1500
Been waiting 10 minutes for a coffee and an egg sandwich There are 5 very confused and hideously inefficient people behind the counter and even fewer customers Ive never seen anything like this in my life,negative,36,25-50,208,<500
Coffee A Sandwiches A Pastries F This is supposed to be a bakery so why do you put your cakes and tarts in a refrigerated case that drys them out Seriously Ive been to bakeries that have been around for 50 years and they make their pastries fresh each morning and by the afternoon are sold out without ever needing a refrigerator Just put them in a glass case like every other bakery No need for a refrigerator to dry them out Urghhhh I want to like you guys so much,negative,91,75-100,476,<500
Its beautiful in this tiny little cozy ice cream shop with no where to sit The employees are rude and I cant even tell you if the ice cream is good After spending 20 minutes at 11 am on a Monday waiting for ice cream in this Claustrophobic box we just left There were not many ppl in there shopping us and another group of ppl I dont know what the hold up was and I dont know why noone even said hey Ill be with you in a few We literally stood at the counter the entire time They are hella slow lack personality we didnt feel comfortable or welcomed Theres a lot of deserts to choose from but again not sure how anything tastes because they are not customer service friendly,negative,133,100-150,696,500-1000
Very cool I picked up 2 of their little cakes to take back home The vegan chocolate one was really good The cake itself was delicious and not too dry as some vegan cake variations can sometimes be I would definitely have their chocolate vegan cake again and would like to try more of their cakes The other cake I got for my friend was their lavender cake with honey buttercream My friend said it was delicious as well The shop itself is very cute and has a vintage vibe to it There is indoor and outdoor patio seating They have coffeeespresso drinks too Id love to come back,positive,109,100-150,587,500-1000
Ive only been here once but I picked out a BUNCH of doughnuts while I was there The young lady that waited on me was very friendly and patient I told her I was a noob and she ran down the entire contents of the cases for the day for me Each and every doughnut I tried was really good especially the cream stick Dunkintake notes on how to make a real cream stick The only one I was a little underwhelmed with was the chocolate krispies doughnutand thats only because the krispies were soggy from the frosting Otherwise great doughnuts and well worth the trip from the NilesYoungstown area,positive,110,100-150,609,500-1000
More ice than cream I was not expecting to have a bad experience The location is nice plenty of parking and easy to find However the selection was not impressive and absolutely no seating inside I dont want to sit outside in 110 heat and eat my frozen treat I went with Butter Pecan and it was icy It seemed like it was partly thawed then refrozen The flavor of the fudge seemed weak not what I know to be fudge I dont think I will be back,negative,88,75-100,451,<500
Bad ordering system take numbers only 3 people working in front that does everything take order fill order and cashier Didnt order anything just left and I noticed a whole lot of others left too Not preparing to wait over an hour BAD Management,negative,44,25-50,256,<500
Decided to try this place again because there was no line We got a chocolate cake donut and a Caramel Lobster Tail The donut was dry as  The lobster tail would have been better if it wasnt so darn hard It was difficult to even take a bite it was so hard Had good flavor but I threw most of it out 10 down the drain Also as we were waiting for our items to be bagged up we noticed that the kitchen was a disaster Maybe they shouldnt have windows Buddy your restaurant is good but your bakery needs some serious improvement,negative,104,100-150,540,500-1000
This place is really fun Its tucked away in a little strip center I dont know what you call it that doesnt look like it would contain an icecream shop so you have to keep sharp eyes out to spot it For nondairy eaters like me they have a surprising amount of options The day I went they had 5 dairyfree sorbets that were so delicious I ended up getting half passionberry and half strawberry moscato yum The coconut macaron on top was sooo sweet but in a good way I liked how the outside of the macaron was crispy and the inside was a bit gooey The torched marshmallow on top put this dessert over the top There is little more that I love in this world than toasted marshmallow Ill definitely be back for more sweet treats,positive,139,100-150,744,500-1000
Today I visited this wonderful new shop and it was the best decision I made all day The owners are super friendly and very knowledgeable about their product I can tell they truly care about and love what they do It really shows through I am not a huge ice cream lover but today I may have changed my mind I tried several different flavors all delicious but I settled on the Panne Cherry And trust me this is the flavor you need to enjoy The creaminess of the ice cream was perfect not over sweet or any bit icy The delicate flavor of the cherries throughout was extraordinary And because it is an option I had this wonderful creation sandwiched in a doughnut Yes a doughnut So put Novel on your list of places to go and soon With I believe 12 different flavor options EVEN a vegan option you are sure to find one to suit you,positive,159,150-200,849,500-1000

Yum yum yum I really really like this little ice cream shop I recommend trying something new that you wont find at other places you wont be disappointed,positive,28,25-50,161,<500
This is my fave location You can see ice cream being being made from the windows You can also sample before having to make that important commitment to a flavor The upstairs helps alleviate congestion issues and the train around the downstairs seating area adds charm Its very family friendly and worth a visit Parking as of my post is kind of a mess while construction occurs behind Mitchells,positive,69,50-75,402,<500
Got here around 9 am on Saturday and line was okay Some of the donuts are huge But they are airy and worth the price for 4 we paid around 14 My boyfriend has the biggest sweet tooth and loved the Pop tart one I liked the cake batter Will be here next time Im in Vegas,positive,57,50-75,274,<500
Sooooo many choices The line is long But it moves at a decent pace Worth the wait Delicious ice cream,positive,20,<50,106,<500

Ugh This was so disappointing For someone to be the boss of all cakes youd think the cake would blow your mind or at the absolute least be some of the better cake youve ever tasted Unfortunately that is not the case My sister and I both got togo items from here after a late night dinner at Buddy Vs at the Venetian We took them back to our hotel I opted for the funfetti cake It ended up being too late to eat mine and I dont like cold cake anyways they refrigerate their cake which I get why they do it but I prefer it be room temperature when I dine on it I ended up eating it the next night and I took the first bite and must have made a face because my sister said whats wrong and I said Hmmm nothing this just tastes like boxed cake Its not really that good at all I mean really I can name NUMEROUS bakeries in Columbus Oh including our grocery store bakery Giant Eagle that are better than this place I would say the cake part tasted like boxed funfetti cake and the frosting tasted cheaper than canned icing So all in all I think Id actually prefer Pillsbury and would label it a tad better than this cake I cant say for sure if the cake in their Hoboken location would be better but I think its safe to assume theyd use all the same ingredients because its the same ownership After this visit I am wondering if the Cake Boss only became famous for his presentation of cakes and not the actual taste Anyways main positive about this place is the line management We were there so late on a Sunday that there wasnt much of a line but there is someone waiting right there with an Ipad helping you out as soon as you walk in Friendly helpful staff Anyways Id recommend passing on this Take a walk down to The Linq and opt for a Sprinkles cupcake instead,negative,345,300- 500,1820,1500-2000
Absolutely delicious Lots of choices some very unique I loved the one filled different cookies in it forget the name The mint is very interesting  very fresh tasting,positive,29,25-50,173,<500
The management doesnt know how to handle large crowds They need a better work flow system Waited 15 hours got chocolate cannoli and regular cannoli I gave the regular cannoli to a homeless person only because I didnt want to waste food Truly disappointed Not worth the wait time or money,negative,51,50-75,299,<500
SOCIAL DISTANCING EDITION This is one of the few places I feel I dont have to review Jenis amazing ice cream speaks for itself This was my first time visiting Jenis since the recent changes due to social distancing Theyve adjusted as necessary and Im quite pleased with the steps theyve taken When you arrive at Jenis youre prompted to wait in line outside of the establishment There werent many people staying 6 feet between each other in line but I dont believe that is something they can necessarily control There are menus posted outside of the store so you can see whats available and make a decision before you arrive inside They only allow one party in the store at a time When you arrive you order and pay for you ice cream as soon as you walk in and then they have a waiting area on the other side where you grab your ice cream The process was quick and I was in and out within 5 minutes All of the associates were wearing masks and they have hand sanitizer available for you at the pick up station I believe their menu is limited or it may have changed as my goto flavor wasnt available This time I went with the darkest chocolate ice cream and it was incredibly rich Jenis has a myriad of flavors and theyre all so rich and creative If youre looking to grab a scoop in a safe and clean environment I recommend going by Jenis,positive,253,250-300,1371,1000-1500
I almost feel like Im being too generous with 2stars We had dinner at Momofuku which happened to be one of the BEST culinary experiences weve ever encountered and decided to get a few cookies to take up to our room At 3 a pop Im expecting delicious happiness to soon be in my belly but guess what the cookies were a complete flop They were stale and flavorless and I almost feel like I should go back and demand a refund What a waste These were definitely not baked in house Some of the different cookie flavors have BHT in them I know most cereals at grocery stores will have this ingredient bc of shelf life integrity so it grosses me out that some of the cookies could probably sit around for months and still be sold Lord knows they taste that way What a disappointing way to complete an amazing dinner,negative,153,150-200,831,500-1000
Went here today St Josephs Day and the staff informed me that they MEVER HEARD OF ST JOSEPHS PASTRY Dont call yourself an Italian bakery Your not,negative,27,25-50,151,<500
Ordered an almond croissant two cheese danishes and one small coffee in the morning we checked out of the Venetian The almond croissant was like taking a bite into dry twoweek old cracker Took one bite and trashed it Did not taste fresh at all Would not recommend The cheese danishes were alright At least there was cheese on top of the danish to combat the dryness of the bread Was able to stomach these at least Also had a coffee Good coffee but would be even better if they put it in a cup that didnt leak See picture Very disappointing Not a great way to start of the long drive back to California,negative,115,100-150,624,500-1000
I have ordered cupcakes from this bakery twice through DoorDash and both times I get cookies I want a refund for both orders but they are closed No answer by phone DoorDash wont respond either Every time I call this bakery they dont answer,negative,44,25-50,246,<500
Sprinkles cupcakes youre my best friend Your vegan red velvet cupcakes are the most amazing cupcakes Ive had to date I always have to stop in while in Vegas and buy two This location has a lot of different cupcakes but Ive only experienced the V red velvet so I cant review the rest but they look damn tasty in the display case,positive,63,50-75,335,<500
Im just going to be really honest for those who wont be I hate this place If I could give it zero stars I would Everyone I know LOVES it because they think its SO tastefully decorated and that the food is delectable But Im here to tell you all that its simply not The first time I visited AmÃlies I had to try very hard not to cringe when I saw all the French vintage garbage adorning the hideous obnoxiously colored walls Everyone I go with always comments on how cute and aesthetically pleasing it is but I could not disagree more Thinking that the food would make up for it I continued in and picked out a macaron and a raspberry tart I was very disappointed because both desserts tasted bland and lifeless I have since been back multiple times and have yet to find a dessert that is even remotely worth the money I have a friend who makes macrons that taste 100x better than AmÃlies do Im tired of people begging to come here and suggesting it as a hang out 95 of the time NC needs to step up its coffeedessert shop game because this is clearly missing the mark Dont waste your money,negative,209,200-250,1127,1000-1500

I love Cake Boss and made a special trip one evening of our Vegas vacation to visit Carlos Bake Shop in the Venetian Giving this place 4 stars for yummy deserts The evening we went to visit was a Saturday night the line was long but it moved quickly There is a window to see them preparing deserts but not much was happening when we were in line Once we got to the front we choose a bunch of different deserts  a cupcake with a Ace of Spades on it some butter cookies dipped in chocolate and sprinklesa chocolate mousse mini cake with ganache a brownie a cannoli a napoleon and a black and white cookie The icing on the cupcake was yummy the mini cake brownie cannoli and bw cookie were all tasted Everything except the bw cookie was really good Im not a fan of that cookie and it is one of their famous treats on the show Oh well It was fun and 37 later I was relieved I didnt spend more They took the order collected the items and packed them all in boxes tied with string and bagged I didnt like that they didnt specify what needed to be refrigerated and unfortunately we left it all on the table that night and realized that we needed to throw out some of the perishables the next day without tasting them,positive,235,200-250,1240,1000-1500
Came for the internet and ended up with the caramelized onion and asparagus crustless quiche this was very good and savory Not pictured is the coconur matcha latte which is a hit,positive,32,25-50,182,<500

This bakery has become a weekly visit for me Absolutely love the atmosphere very retro and quaint at the same time I usually go around 1011am so theres not a line They are known for their salted caramel brownie bars so if you gomake sure to order one I stick with the glutenfree one since its a little healthier and the taste is no different than their classic Seating is accommodating for groups of people or people like myself who go alone to enjoy some quiet alone time with a latte and pastry Other yummy options are their berry salad liver pate on a baguette sandwich and their BLT croissant Highly suggest Oh and theyre apparently open 247,positive,118,100-150,667,500-1000
My first trip to one of these highly anticipated locations on the west side  it was a COMPLETE disappointment We ordered the tiramisu a chocolate chip cookie  cannoli The cookie was hard  stale cannoli filling was gritty  tiramisu overpriced for what we ate I think Buddy needs to revisit this location for some retraining in the kitchen,negative,61,50-75,348,<500
This ice cream place is covered in fun and colorful decorations filled with ice cream candies and toys Unfortunately the customer service was extremely slow and there was a long line that we ended up leaving My brother in law decided to go back 30 minutes later because it was finally empty but when we got the cookies and cream it was disappointing and underwhelming,negative,65,50-75,372,<500

Called in for a pick up but was told not until 3 because there was only one person on duty Ouch Who hasnt been there No problem I understand So I go down expecting to stand in line but there was no line and there was 2 people on duty Maybe the second person just showed up to help and was in a hurry because he wasnt wearing a mask He asks me what I want and I told him banana pudding and he replied with snark in his voice its not in the menu what else I reply chocolate chunk aaaaaand Ill let you decide and Ill be back he says as he closes the window The other person working finally came to the window to ask what else they were nice so I told them Banana cream pie and asked them to remind the guy about wearing a mask since he was now digging in the ice cream He came to the window and asked me if there was anything I needed and I nicely asked him to mask up to which he replied He didnt need to because we are social distancing and he works in the back I simply reminded him he is working with food and he closes the window and walked away which honestly I didnt have anything else to say and glad he didnt either I hope he has corrected himself out of respect and safety for the customers of this place,negative,249,200-250,1245,1000-1500

I was so excited to try Sprinkles and unfortunately these cupcakes did not live up to the hype I ordered a chocolate on chocolate cupcake it was crumblydry inside and basically had a similar flavor to a box cake mix I gave 2 stars because the ice cream was great Loved the capt crunch flavor yum We also tried the snicker doodles and they didnt disappoint  The ordering system is nonsense one area for cupcake only and another for cupcake ice cream cookies Why not just have one area for all of it The employees were friendly but it seemed like they were extremely over staffed in the cupcake section,negative,111,100-150,621,500-1000
Delicious The croissant that is sooo worth waiting for Nestled in a small corner of the Venetian hotel Bouchon Bakery is a small bustling friendly and quaint little cafe that is perfect for a morning grab of a bakery item and coffee togo The line gets long fast and times of service can be cumbersome but if you have the time this is a great option for breakfast or a afternoon coffee and snack,positive,74,50-75,408,<500
I ate brunch here yesterday morning with my mother I called ahead to see if they took reservations I was told they did not So when we arrived we were told about a 30 to 35 minute wait We asked to be seated in the section nearest the glass doors When They first called us to seat us about 30 minutes later they offered us a table that is a shared bench with others We told the hostess we prefer to not have that kind of seating and would rather have a table by the glass doors I mentioned they had five open tables and perhaps we could have one Hostess told me that the tables are reserved I told her that when I called I was told I could not reserve a table She then told me that they keep those tables open for the owner or the owners brother in case they come in Of course I found this to be absurd I know that highrollers get better service but I still found this to be quite absurd So we sat down to await a better table About 10 minutes later another hostess trier to seat us at another table with a shared booth We told her again that we would like to have a regular table so she had us wait again About another 15 to 20 minutes went by and another host came to seat us and tried to seat us in a bigger table with a shared bench Just as he was doing that one of the original hostesses came over and told him that we wanted a table I gestured to the now four open tables and he said that theyre reserved I thanked him but told him we were going to just leave He said he didnt want us to leave so he gave us one of the tables that we had asked about Frankly we used to love this place We always came here whenever we are in Las Vegas The food and service has always been impeccable This time the servers were nice but just overworked The sticky bun was pretty dry and frankly not very good The petite djeunre American was just OK and the croque madame which Ive had each time Ive been here was not very good I asked for the egg to be over easy and it came out almost totally well done Sadly I dont see any need to come back here again which is disappointing because we really liked the restaurant,negative,426,300- 500,2143,2000+

Had a creme brulee and a caramel latte The donuts were great The creme brulee is a bit overrated Its essentially a custard donut with a hard caramel coating Good but I was expecting something a little more eggy and dense in terms of the filling The donuts are huge btw not a bad thing but makes sampling difficult and pricey Good for sharing Its a little tight inside but theres plenty of patio seating in the back,positive,78,75-100,427,<500

Damn you and your beautiful pastries No not because I cant stop eating them But because Im convinced that I keep ordering incorrectly and surely something in that case is as delicious as it looks Turns out thats just not the situation at all here You get a solid gold star for strong delicious coffee but Im done handing over my hard earned cash for disappointing baked goods Theyre just not good The red velvet cupcake was dense almost stale The chocolate chip cookie was dry dry dry Thanks though for the coffee,negative,93,75-100,537,500-1000

Nice place to get speciality french bakery items We tried all the 6 flavors of macarons Salted caramel okok vanilla and raspberry good coffee and pistachio yummy chocolate yummiest We even got the chocolatecovered raspberry but asked the guy over the checkout to exchange it for something else as we were pretty unhappy with our plain raspberry and didnot even want to open and try it He happily did that and gave us 2 we just asked for 1 of our favorite macarons Nice touch which just adds to the name of Bouchon Bakery The staff is pretty honest about when the macarons are made and which are fresher I would happily gulp down chocolate  coffee or pistachio again,positive,120,100-150,689,500-1000
Soo good I recommend the coconut macaroon so far Even though Im not a coconut fan this little thing was to die for,positive,23,<50,118,<500

I came to the Linq for something else but saw the Ghirardelli Ice Cream  Chocolate Shop and decided to stop in As soon as I got near the entrance a friendly employee offered me a free Ghirardelli chocolate square dark  sea salt caramel flavor I took it and thanked them as I walked inside There were plenty of chocolates everywhere but that was not what caught my attention There were a bunch of sundaes you could choose and my sweet tooth couldnt say no I especially couldnt say no when after I checked in on my Yelp app there was an offer of 1 off any ice cream sundae Done deal I ordered a sea salt caramel sundae Ocean Beach and the employees were quick to get it made for me Ocean Breeze is vanilla ice cream smothered with creamy caramel freshly homemade hot fudge and sea salt Perfectly topped with whipped cream creamy caramel sea salt and a Ghirardelli SQUARES Milk Chocolate After I took a picture of it since it looked so good I dipped my spoon into the ice cream and took a bite It was just as yummy as it looked Ghirardelli is a little pricey for my tastes but I wouldnt mind coming back here every so often for a sundae The free chocolate doesnt hurt any either,positive,225,200-250,1212,1000-1500
Great Place to get a quick breakfast or snack I really like that it is right across from the hotel elevators so you dont have to walk too far to get a good pastry I really enjoy their Ham  Cheese criossant and they make a nice cup of coffe,positive,50,25-50,245,<500
This place is amazing First off they have some of the friendliest employees youll find anywhere I was so excited just going through and trying the different flavors I felt like I was doing something far more special than just ordering ice cream Maybe thats because its so much better than just ice cream I ordered the fresh strawberry not made with any frozen strawberries which is a big deal on a donutyes a donut With Capn Crunch Berries OMG The donut is slightly warm the ice cream was amazing and the crunch added to the overall explosion of texture and flavors The prices are very reasonable almost cheap considering the quality and the experience My daughter who made her own special concoction summed it up best when she stopped eating hers for a couple of minutes and said its so good I dont want to eat it cause it will be gone Highly recommend,positive,155,150-200,888,500-1000
This is a cute ice cream shop I had 2 scoops in a cup of carrot cake and apple pie They were both excellent My favorite item however was the brownie If Im not mistaken it was called the kitchen sink brownie It was perfectly dense rich and not cakey at all It had marshmallows caramel drizzle and large pieces of toffee on top Best Brownie Ever I regret not buying more of them to take home with me,positive,79,75-100,414,<500
I feel bad but man 530 on a Saturday night and you have 4 flavors 4 And the vanilla only had enough for 1 scoop Bummer cause the vanilla was good  but not what we would have ordered if we had more choices,negative,44,25-50,213,<500
Heard really good things about Bouchon Bakery I ordered 1 Iced Hazelnut Latte  first off did not taste any hazelnut Espresso was burnt and tasted like shit Couldnt even drink half of it 2 Vanilla Macaron these were HUGE size of my palm I was excited then I bit into it hard as a rock Was very disappointedI paid 350 for a macaron I expect it to be at least half decent I guess I just expected more from this bakery  Would probably not come back for the macarons or the coffee,negative,94,75-100,503,500-1000
Overall extremely disappointed We ordered a salted caramel brownie after seeing the amazing reviews and were not pleased The brownie tasted over cooked and raw at the same time It was very bitter and has no salt on it We couldnt even cut through it with out plastic utensils My daughter order the strawberry cream cheese pastry which was pretty good Prices are a little high The water station had warm water not a fan The decorations were not my cup of tea but they fit the overall theme of the cafe One thing that stood out was a awkwardly placed painting of a strange little girl in the bathroom Would not be returning or recommending to anyone There are plenty of coffee places near by that are way better I would recommend checking out the smelly cat coffee bar,negative,140,100-150,782,500-1000
I got the almond buttercrunch with a waffle cone Ice cream was delicious Waffle cone tasted like frosting on a cake I wasnt a fan My husband got the almond buttercrunch and the salted butter Carmel with a toasted homemade marshmallow All three were amazing,positive,45,25-50,263,<500
Wow This is the best ice cream I have ever had  seriously folks this place shows Sweet Republic whos boss The ice cream is rich and creamy and full of flavor I tried the butter pecan banana peanut butter and chocolate The chocolate was unlike any chocolate ice cream I have had before  you could actually taste the coco flavor and it was more satisfying than a sugar loaded Hersheys concoction Bonus  they have pretzel cones This went especially well with scoops of chocolate and peanut butter Yum I hopped on the froyo train for awhile there but this place is going to cause me to derail and get fat Oh well Ill be happy The interior is a very cute oldschool ice cream parlor It reminded me of Smeeks There was not seating inside but about 5 tables outside They also have lots of retro candies and freshly baked cookies and complimentary water in a jug flavored with lavender and lemon Ive already forgotten that Mary Coyles is closing down,positive,174,150-200,981,500-1000

I really wanted this experience to be the best one I had ever experienced because of the hype and it wasnt The lobster tails were old dry and flavorless the Cannolis were missing flavor as well I loved the filling but for the price it just wasnt worth it I can honestly say that I wont be going back to Carlos,negative,61,50-75,320,<500
This used to be a fantastic unique spot to grab a delicious treat but in the last couple years this place has lost its appeal Arrogant service people groups of people that hang out for hours on end long lines that can last up to 45 minutes and lack of parking coupled with the scandal over employee pay have taken the lustre off what was a unique spot in Charlotte The treats are still amazing but I hate actually going,negative,80,75-100,428,<500
This evening I took my sons to get ice cream and as we walked up there were maybe five or six teen age girls behind the glass and as they saw that they were going to serve a black family all of the girls started looking and laughing at us and being simple not even acknowledging us purposely as they were too busy being childish racist surly and tactless Its disheartening to see kids and teenagers being trained to exclude another race just for the way someone looks or the color of their skin Sorry young ladies but my quality of life doesnt diminish because you dont like beautiful black americans As I am aware that your little noggins are still in the developmental phase it doesnt negate the fact that your shallow minds and entitlement behaviors are offensive You would think out of all the brains behind the glass two of them wouldve rubbed their two IQ points together and said lets be deep and lets make our pockets deeper and stack our coins for college Grow up little girls Honey hut needs to fire your behinds Ugh to racism against any race With that being said I think Ill watch GET OUT tonight I had to include that for I just had to Peace fledgling go make your parents proud or shhhii Maybe you did,negative,227,200-250,1246,1000-1500

We were really looking forward to experiencing Carlos bakery Waiting over 30 minutes to get inside was totally doable Everything looked sooo good However everything we tried cannoli crumb bun chocolate chip cookie triple choc chip cookie apple turnover and coconut macaroon EVERYTHING was tasteless Not worth the 3900 spent nor the time Just save the time and money take some pics and call it a day,negative,67,50-75,414,<500

Oh my gosh What a special restaurant One must take an elevator to the tower floor to arrive at this special spot Love the ambiance of the dark wood panel windows with a view to an outside dining area Too bad we were there for only bakery pastries amazingly delish because Im sure a meal there would be equally awesome The wait staff are impeccably dressed and very professional This is one special place,positive,74,50-75,417,<500
I was in Vegas for six days and passed this bakerys kiosk multiple times a day as I went to and from my room My plan was to pick some up before my flight home On my departure day I was unexpectedly running late but MADE time to run by Luckily no one was there at the time I arrived So I asked the lady working the kiosk some questions about the croissants but she looked completely annoyed first experience with bad service in Las Vegas the I ordered two of the Oreo cookie sandwich things and asked her to box them because I would be taking them aboard my flight When I got home that evening I excitedly opened the box to present the two Oreos to my two boys at homeand was horrified to see it was only 133 cookies Ugh,negative,143,100-150,737,500-1000

One of the best bakeshops I have been too I love most of their baked goodies It also is a very clean and tidy place This makes it look appealing and inviting to keep on returning to buy their goodies So far I have not been disappointed yet with the cleanliness of any of their shops I have been too such as Tustin Spectrum Westminister and Alton in Irvine where I go to most of the time I hope they can keep this up and the quality of their baked goodies as well By the way I wish this bake shop would bring back selling their Coffee Bread with red bean and mochi inside I love red bean and mochi Can they make this in any bread like their Taro bread,positive,131,100-150,665,500-1000
We went here because it had ravin reviews on Yelp The ice cream was icey It wasnt the creamy sensation I was hoping for Ive had better Tillamook ice cream They did have a good variety of flavors but that was about it,negative,43,25-50,224,<500
So I came back to Bouchon for the a box of macaronsjust to try the different flavors The coffee was good as usual the vanilla bean and lemon were also good The raspberry was okay I liked the texture overall and do recommend it The thing is that I like desserts but I dont like them overly sweet I had the red velvet and I know a lot of people like it super sweet but I liked that it was more chocolate in taste and it had the right moisture If youre looking for really sweet red velvet I probably would not recommend this to you But I felt that Bouchon delivered me what I was looking for ,positive,119,100-150,609,500-1000
Amelies was filthy and it makes it uncomfortable to imagine eating there when everything in the building looks so unclean including the pastry case where they store the food,negative,29,25-50,176,<500
Im not sure what the hype of this place is I had to wait outside in the heat to be able to order as they are limiting the number of people inside the store I got a peach ice cream cone which was alright I was feeling nostalgic for peach ice cream from back home and this was an okay way to get my fix The entire visit took a little more than an hour from the time I got in line to when I finished ordering I probably wont be visiting again I dont think the wait time price and quality of the product justify coming back,negative,108,100-150,533,500-1000
I wanted to try Milk Bar and was so excited it was next to momofuku We ordered three cookies and two tastes old and dry We threw them away after two bites cornflakes cookie they were that bad  The third was compose cookies and it was ok Just ok for 3 cookie is unacceptable I loved watching her on masterchef and wanted to try her stuff,negative,67,50-75,345,<500
Well I watched every episode of cake boss and thought wow how it looked amazing and how I would so like to try  Im Vegas and my daughter and I hear he opened one in Vegas and were thrilled and couldnt wait to try However we buy and cant wait to get back to hotel to partake and to our disappointment the cupcakes all two n cake we purchased were not good at all They were dry n cream wasnt soft n creamy n I dont bake  but box mix would have tasted better   So will not be going their again sorry,negative,106,100-150,510,500-1000
Hmmmmm I wish there were more than 5 stars I could award it Super friendly people who will answer your questions and the bakery dishes out some wonderful desserts,positive,29,25-50,165,<500
Line like a roller coaster ride Okay not THAT long but in the evenings the line can get pretty longand yet its worth it Cute interior with old school candy and toys It threw me off the first time but they let you try various flavors on actual mini spoons rather than disposable spoons bc its better for the environment and lowers costs Im assuming The dulce de leche ice cream flavor is so good They have several combo ice creamcookietopping creations that are really good too I wish they had a menu outside so there was more time to look at it and be prepared once you get up to the register to order Be careful this place is so good its dangerous,positive,124,100-150,670,500-1000
This review is based on my service After coming here and spending a lot of money trying different pastries I made sure to ask if they got everything They assured me everything was in the bag I took their word and headed back on an 8 hour drive back to NorCal Fast fowardget home my kids wanted their pastery for dessert and we were missing some I paid for pastries that I didnt receive not happy at all this place is not the cheapest and now that was money wasted,negative,90,75-100,475,<500
Rude staff I waited in line for ten minutes with three small children in tow I ordered a simple coffee and the staff member refused to serve me because I didnt take a ticket It would have been an additional 20 minute wait His tone was rude and condescending He could have showed some compassion and just made me my coffee,negative,61,50-75,328,<500
Buddy Im calling you out on your lame cannoli My mom can smoke you any day of the week I cant believe you put your name on that Im Italian I know Italian pastries your shop here in vegas is a tourist trap All hype And dude you guys break the cardinal sin of cannoli servingyou pre fill them and let them sit for hours WTH my man Like any respectable host you fill each cannoli as they are served It takes like 6 seconds A complete waste of 20 Shame on you my dude,negative,95,75-100,493,<500

It was mediocre at best The chocolate cake tasted very dry reminded me of a little Debbie devils food cake We also got a vanilla cookie nothing to write home about The sugar cookie tasted like the Christmas cookies in a tin from my childhood  We wanted to be fans but sadly no dice I have two stars because the employees were so very nice and helpful,negative,68,50-75,357,<500
I would say this place is not as great as it is popular The pastries are not all that good and the place is so busy its not the cleanest I had the salted layered latte and would say it was good but not great,negative,45,25-50,211,<500
I drove to Las Vegas from Los Angeles CA just to go to Carlos Bakery I have been to the one in New Jersey and New York and it was great The pastries there tasted fantastic so I was expecting the same in Vegas Unfortunately it was not great I had to throw away the cannoli because it tasted bad I only ate half of these cheesecakechocolate mousse because it tasted weird They did not have much of a variety They didnt have velvet cupcakes and no strawberry shortcake they were working on them It was a big disappointment,negative,99,75-100,535,500-1000
Creamy latte happiness Wonderful flavor which separates and distinct from larger corporate co,positive,13,<50,95,<500
First off I think its ABSURD that Babcock uses gelatin in their ice cream Any ice cream maker worth their salt would never use that sort of additive seriously no one does thisits very strange I suspect theyre trying to cover up poor quality ingredients Secondly I cant understand why Babcock refuses make and use dairy products that are hormone freeeven the behemoth dairy conglomerate Deans has stopped using hormones Besides those two BIG strikes against it most flavors are generally unimpressive with the exception of the awesomeness that is the orange chocolate chip custard hence two stars and not one Its important to observe however that creamy deliciousness of the orange custard ice cream results from it being a custard and NOT because it comes laced with gelatin,negative,129,100-150,802,500-1000
YUM So good The sundaes are amazing Excellent quality ice cream and cupcakes combined together in a bowl HEAVENLY Great staff too very friendly even with a line up of people out the door,positive,34,25-50,194,<500
One of my favorite treats I save this place when I am in a good mood or need a pick me up lol The macrarons are delightful and they always have fun flavors The vibe is so fun inside The only downside is the line can get long on weekends and they run out pretty quick  just a testament to how delicous they are,positive,65,50-75,319,<500
This place is the best Deserts are great and the sandwiches also Very artsy industrial and raw Plenty of space and busy Wish they had one Boston prob in Somerville Allston or Cambridge,positive,33,25-50,191,<500
Awful desserts  The French macarons were super soft and Mushy Overly sweet as well Im used to crunchy but chewy macarons No one ate any of them I got They went in the trash The croissants were way too flaky One bite and there was crumbs all over our floor Flaky is definitely a good thing in croissants but this was way too much This place is over rated Tourist crowd it because they dont know any better,negative,79,75-100,417,<500
The line is ridiculous The cannolis were already filled so it wasnt as crunchycrispy as I would want them to be but at least it wasnt soggy I expected more from the lobster tail since I got them right as they came out but I guess thats what I get for not visiting the Hoboken location The cheesecakes were meh Thought they could have been better I was pretty disappointed I watched all 7 season of Cake Boss just to be this disappointed so sad But if you want to try it out for yourself its in the Venetian hotel near the shoppes I always got lost trying to find this place but finally got there and was just sad I think they close later than most stores so I guess you can head over after dinner for some overpriced desserts,negative,141,100-150,751,500-1000
Hot summer Perfect day for a milkshake I was finally able to try Ninetys which Ive heard so many good reviews about Located right near UNC Charlotte on the boardwalk where you can get a sweet treat and walk around I Im tried the strawberry shortcake milkshake and I cannot wait to go back to try one of the donut sandwiches or macaroons,positive,63,50-75,344,<500
Bad enough my wife and I are in Vegas with our children but add an absolutely disgusting 12 dollar milkshake to the mix and it gets worse We are staying in the cosmopolitan and we heard from friend we have to try the milk bar Well maybe they were drunk when the ordered The shake wasnt sour however IT separated like the ice cream was made out of water Basically IT looked like a cup of milk with ice in IT but the milk was almost cottage cheese texture So disappointing And now my kids are complaining like crazy and Im already aggro that I cant booze IT up lol,negative,110,100-150,577,500-1000
Its so sad that they werent open eventhough it says open I stopped here on an ice cream date with my 3 year old son and unfourtanetly we had to drive somewhere else just to get ice cream because they were closed Please make sure to update your business information because you can easily loose cuatomers with false information So not worth it,negative,63,50-75,346,<500
This is the defacto hipster place to go in Charlotte If paying an arm and leg for pastries that cost next to nothing to make is your idea of cool you will fit in here The pastries taste good but they are nothing special and not worth the price This is not a must visit foody destination in Charlotte and you are certainly paying a premium for its popularity I would be willing to bet that 90 of AmÃlies fans have never baked before Avoid,negative,85,75-100,452,<500
Great cold brew coffee If you never had cold brew coffee you would never go back Oh and the pastries are Phenomenal,positive,22,<50,119,<500

I just tried Milk Bar tonight and it was really nothing special I had the fruity cereal and thought that the taste was just okay I would probably never crave for it and I definitely wouldnt come to the strip just for this I did like the set up however and the staff were friendly as well and let us sample a few different soft serve,negative,66,50-75,338,<500

Worst customer service I was browsing through Instagram recently and saw an ad from Sprinkles cupcakes probably because I recently followed Nothing Bundt Cakes which by the way are delicious I have passed by Sprinkles before but have never had the opportunity to stop in and try their cupcakes However the cupcakes look cute I had been wanting to send someone a thoughtful gift to their work and to my surprise Sprinkles delivers I went ahead and placed my order online the website kept timing out on me By the time I was able to enter all the information the delivery time I wanted was no longer available I had to push back my order by 3 hours The cupcakes were pricey 45 for a dozen 15 for delivery I called to see if there was any way they could be delivered earlier since I wanted to ensure they got there before business closing time They mentioned they would try to arrive 30 mins earlier The delivery arrived on time no complaints there When the person received the delivery they texted me I asked for a picture I was excited for the presentation They were squished Definitely not worth 60 I immediately reached out to Sprinkles they began to question me How were they squished Why was the delivery acceptedMaybe because it was a surprise and I wasnt there to inspect the delivery I sent pictures for proof After seeing the photos they apologized and said it looks like the box was bumped They offered me a comp for more cupcakes however who says that solves this delivery Who says I want to pay to get them delivered to me Expensive and bad experience I requested a refund instead NEVER heard back If you want delicious cupcakes or if you ever want to deliver cupcakes definitely go to Nothing Bundt Cakes Received a delivery myself and the presentation was beautiful Half the price of Sprinkles and better quality,negative,328,300- 500,1879,1500-2000

Had Been wanting to try these crepes for a while when I finally did last monday I was soo surprised about the rudeness of the cook with the beard What a douche I mean this guy was so rude from the get go just out of the blue with no previous conversation of any kind I had brought some folks from out of the country to try the crepes and only thing i could imagine that got him angry was that we were speaking another language the cherry on top was the throwing of the finished crepe on the little metal basket they have without any word after we got our order everyone just stayed there for a few seconds just looking at each other in disbelief of how that dude was so rude for nothing The crepe was good but come on Worst thing is that there were ZERO people in line so you cant even write it down to being stressed out for being swamped it was monday around 11 am,negative,173,150-200,884,500-1000

Mehhh Ive seriously experienced better Maybe Ive been spoiled by all the good ice cream in LA already There wasnt much variety as I was hoping for for an ice cream spotin Vegas I had the Cereal Milk with sprinkles added and got bored of the flavors real quick That rarely happens with ice cream for me Overall overhyped and overpriced ,negative,62,50-75,349,<500

Mitchells has the best ice cream in Northeast Ohio Their seasonal offerings are always fresh tasty and unique The eggnog ice cream offered during the winter season is life changing The customer service is always phenomenal I have never left a visit to Mitchells disappointed I would forever recommend visiting Mitchells for ice cream needs,positive,55,50-75,349,<500

I am a big fan of milky desserts and once I saw Milk Bar in Cosmo I just had to give it a try I decided to order the cereal milk soft serve since I absolutely love love love Afters Ice Creams version of it Honestly it was alright There wasnt really anything special about itin fact there was a strange after taste I finished about half of the serving before I got tired of the flavor and gave the rest to my boyfriend I probably wouldnt come back just because the prices are a little offputting I think there are other places that would satisfy my sweet tooth a little better,negative,112,100-150,593,500-1000

Located right up the escalator of the Cosmopolitan I was so ecstatic when I came across Milk Bar right before they were closing My friend who has been to the NY location more recently than me said that this location was not only a little more expensive but it also is of course not as good as the NY location I had their Cereal Milk Soft Serve 6 with Cornflakes 1 It was definitely bigger than the one from NY It was just as delicious as I remembered Super soft and creamy and had the perfect amount of sweetness If you love the leftover milk from cereal than I cant imagine why you wouldnt love this soft serve The cornflakes were an added bonus that just gave it all texture and crunchabsolutely perfect I was told that the NY location adds some extra cereal to the bottom of the soft serve so that when youre almost doneyoure surprised with some extra crunchy goodness Sadly this location didnt do that Hopefully they change that soon I also tried their Crack Pie 650 Super good I was expecting an actual pie but this was more of a browniecookielike pie I cant pinpoint the taste but it was a delicious A little sweeter than my liking but still enjoyable And of course I ended my trip by getting some cookies to go 3 each My favorites are the Blueberry  Cream Cornflakes and Compost Cookie Theyre a little thicker and harder than the last time I had them from NY about 2 years ago But the flavor was still the sameYUM Overall pricey it is but its so good I would probably stop by for some soft serve every time I was in Vegas Location is very convenient and easy to find,positive,299,250-300,1644,1500-2000
Now Im a pink box fanatic but will splurge downtown and stop by this place Location isnt very convenient unless youre walking around the parking lot across the street is often full They have a variety of vegan doughnuts which is awesome and Im not sure if they have any gluten free options The strawberry shortcake one is AMAZING Definitely too large to eat yourself most of their doughnuts are completely shareable and always fresh Im not surprised they sell out on a regular,positive,84,75-100,489,<500
My brother and I were craving some Ice Cream tonight and instead of going to our usual placce Churn we decided to Yelp another ice cream shop  and I am so glad we did We now have our new goto spot The owners Paul and Gina were super duper friendly We ordered Halo Halo Filipino Dessert with crushed ice evaporated milk ice cream flan and all other good stuff and a bunch of Taho Filipino Sweet Tofu Dessert Both were amazing and made me reminisce so much of my childhood in the Philippines They also have a huge selection of ice cream as well as shaved ice and boba We only live three minutes away which is super dangerous for us because we would want to be back every single day,positive,132,100-150,709,500-1000
Also should people be taking the bakery items placing them on their tray and then putting them back And why does the cashier deal with money and handle cakes without a glove,negative,32,25-50,178,<500
Have always heard this name being thrown around but being from the Midwest I cant really get to it easily Ive had cookies sent to be before and those were all spectacular but Ive ALWAYS wanted to try their signature soft serve ice cream and milk bar pie I know that this is a trendy place but 8 for vanilla soft serve and flakes I dont think so I only ate the parts with the flakes but the soft serve didnt taste any special than what I can get at DQ The flakes gave it a nice crunch but was a tad salty It balanced out with ice cream but interesting at first Their milk bar pie was 650 for a very very small slice I was shocked when I opened to see how big it was BUT it did taste very good It had a crumbly cookie crust and the filling tasted a bit like custard It was INCREDIBLY sweet so make sure you also grab water or coffee to wash down the sugar but I did enjoy this item I would order the pie and cookies to be sent to me if I ever crave but would probably not seek out their ice cream anytime soon,positive,208,200-250,1037,1000-1500
Really wanted to go but there is no where to park Went around the block a couple times and were hoping there would be a safe place to walk from Nope Sad because we went to the old location in the past This one is right on central and parking lot,negative,51,50-75,250,<500
Mitchells Homemade Ice Cream was a great mid day treat on our trip to Cleveland They have so many flavors I enjoyed the Coffee Chocolate Chunk and my husband had the Porter Chocolate Chunk Both flavors were pretty good Id stop back if Im ever in the area,positive,48,25-50,262,<500
This was great service and a fun crew I got the banana cream pie with chocolate ice cream I loved the flavor of this It had freshly cut bananas graham crackers and chocolate ice cream YUM The only thing that I noticed is that it melted pretty fast and its a bit icy I like creamier ice cream so it had a bit more overrun that I prefer but overall was delicious,positive,72,50-75,374,<500
Soo much to choose from We happened to visit on their 1year anniversary so they had exotic cars parked outside you can sit and take pictures with the owner was there doing raffle for different prizes from touristy things like bus tour to free donutseach person received a raffle ticket for coming in and also a free birthday cake donut It was a nice celebration The selection was pretty extensive as wellI loved their creme brulee donut The glaze cracked when you broke it in half,positive,86,75-100,495,<500
I mean this place isnt as bad as some yelp reviews make it out to be Yeah the prices on Milk Bars desserts are a bit high but youre on the strip inside a trendy hotelIts to be expected I tried the cereal milk soft serve with corn flakes It was 7 for a decent serving The soft serve tasted pretty close to milk left in your bowl after eating sweet cereal so not nearly as sweet as regular soft serve Also the corn flakes were awesome but you have to like the saltysweet combination They also sell packaged cookies and milkshakes Service is fine Not overly friendly but theyre just slinging pricey sweets in Vegas so you cant really blame them,positive,122,100-150,668,500-1000
Slightly off the beaten path but close enough its a can miss Even midday the place is a buz with a great mix of locals and visitors alike They flock in and sometimes line up for the very best donuts in Las Vegas perhaps nationally Always fun and tasty custom creations like French toast or creme brule You would never find beauties like this in a grocery store or chain They are big but still light enough to enjoy your own but I suggest being ready to share a bite if given that look You know the look Service is top notch the entire crew is cool especially Mathew,positive,109,100-150,578,500-1000
The girls working the counter were really friendly and helpful But management seriously needs to add more employees to the peak hour shifts There was one girl working the register and only one other girl serving the orders I came on a Saturday evening and I literally waited 30 minutes for an overpriced ice cream sundae because the line was so long It felt like I was waiting for over an hour because the girls standing in front of me in line had the worst BO that Ive ever encountered The location is great and is adjacent to many other eateries and bars by the Linq hotel While the shop itself is relatively small there are several tables right outside for customers to sit and eat which is convenient If it werent for the wait time I wouldve given the place 3 stars,negative,143,100-150,783,500-1000
Super friendly staff and owners and there is always at least one or five new flavors to be excited for A great neighborhood spot to chill with friends and family on a warm evening and the ice cream is well worth the trip on cold evenings too Bring back ramen plz,positive,51,50-75,269,<500
We used to come here weekly and LOVED it Seems theres been quite a change since the last time we were here a few months ago Love the new Affogato addition that was delicious HOWEVER  the scoops are WAYYYY TOO SMALL In the Fatty Daddy cup you used to get a macaroon on the bottom 2 good scoops of ice cream on top of that another macaroon another scoop of ice cream topped with a large toasted marshmallow Now you get 2 SMALL scoops of ice cream with a macaroon on top and the marshmallow is 1 more GO BACK TO THE OLD WAY I didnt even get the new Fatty Daddy cup because its a complete rip off compared to what you used to get The new Fatty Daddy cup will never be a famous cookie cup Please go back to the old way and make your prices more reasonable Its quite a drive for us to visit Fatty Daddys now and the changes were very disappointing Like I said Affogato was delicious ice cream flavors were yummy maybe offer LESS cereal flavors but the new portions and prices are EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTING,negative,194,150-200,1057,1000-1500
The good delicious ice cream The bad very expensive ice cream I might as well get a whole pint of Ben  Jerrys from Publix down the road for less than what it costs for one scoop here When compared to pretty much any other ice cream shop Jenis prices are more expensive What also upsets me with Jenis opening is Charlottes obsession with trendy chains has really negatively impacted actual local ice cream shops within a 10 minute walk Golden Cow Creamery and Two Scoops I wouldnt be surprised if both of these good local ice cream shops close within the next year based on how people seem to be fascinated by Jenis Shame on these people for not supporting local businesses Shame on Jenis for opening up their shop near where local competitors already had a presence Support Mom  Pop get your ice cream from Charlotte based shops,negative,151,150-200,851,500-1000
Macarons here are ok Neither delicious nor disgusting But certainly not worth the price or the trip from California Ive definitely have had better I wouldnt recommend this place to friends or family though,negative,34,25-50,212,<500
You know how you get so excited to try something new that your expectations just go beyond the imaginable  then once you experience it  get disappointed to the point where you no longer want that thing any more Well thats EXACTLY what happened After reading so many good reviews about this place  being an ice cream fiend I could not wait to try out this place I could not have been any more disappointed to the point where now I have a distrust for ice cream I tried the Cookie Monster Ice Cream it was basically vanilla ice cream with blue food coloring and oh did I mention NO COOKIES there was supposed to be chunks of cookies in there If I wanted ordinary borderline bland I would have just picked up a pint of plain vanilla ice cream from the grocery store and not driven to this place where parking is on the other side  you have to go in circles to find a spot And to make sense of the mismatch between the store decorations and the Chinese takeout boxes is just ridiculous  a waste of time If you dont want the relationship between you  your ice cream to spoil then I suggest you skip this place all together because it is not all that it is cracked up to be,negative,229,200-250,1197,1000-1500
Got the red velvet Nutella overload and the triple chocolate Definitely recommend going early because donuts sell out fast,positive,19,<50,126,<500
I had heard a lot of hype the birthday cake was overpriced and completely dry After letting it thaw it was even worse I also tried the French toast flavored ice cream The cashier pointed to the French toast ice cream picture I paid and what came out had no toppings on it That was frustrating but worse was the taste It was like salted butter ice cream I ended up taking 2 bites and literally throwing it away at the pink counter Youd be better going to ANY other dessert place around,negative,93,75-100,499,<500
For a breakfast restaurant located in the beautiful Las Vegas Venetian Hotel I expected much much better Although this particular day didnt seem to be a busy day for the hotel we found Bouchon extremely busy Hmm that would normally indicate a top notch restaurant eh Our wait It was about 4550 minutes so naturally I was expecting some really top notch food to be coming In fact I was really counting on having some gourmet waffles this particular morning Well would you believe it this place actually ran out of waffles How do you run out of waffles Sure perhaps a restaurant could run out of frozen Lego waffles but I would expect THIS restaurant to be making their own fresh waffles which you should NEVER run out of Unbelievable its just flour eggs sugar milk not much required I got no excuses just were out Okaaaay well after I got over the fact they ran out of waffles I ordered some really basic pouched eggs which I expected to arrive in front of me tout de suite Nope I was once again extremely disappointed Delivery of our basic food order was incredibly slow  making our whole experience at Bouchon a huge time waster during an otherwise beautiful morning Solution Well for the rest of our stay at the Venetian we boycotted Bouchon and had some great fast and delicious breakfast meals at the Food Court which is the place to go if you dont want the hassles you might be subjected to at Bouchon Perhaps the test is to ask how long your wait will be at Bouchon and then judge good luck ,negative,277,250-300,1567,1500-2000
Being it was 107 degrees today ice cream sounded perfect Unfortunately two stars for the quality I got butter pecan which was extremely salty The killer price tag of 26 for two single scoops a root beer float and a pack of gum didnt exactly helped either The decor of the shop was cute with a few different choices of candies and small toys Overall probably wouldnt come back,negative,69,50-75,390,<500
We went and ordered strawberry cream donut and maple bar My daughters were in absolute delight They loved the strawberry and cream My husband loved the maple bar The owners are extremely nice and pleasant The place is clean and inviting Long line but they move very quickly This vegan will definitely be back,positive,54,50-75,318,<500
I finally gave Sprinkles a chance One star for interior decoration and another star for decent service Im pretty picky when it comes to cupcakes but I came out of here thinking that I could make myself a better cupcake with my own ovenkitchen The cake itself was really dry and crumbly and Im not really a fan of thick icing Maybe I should have tried their ice cream or sandwich but with just their basic cupcake really lacking Im not sure the specialty treats would have been too much better However I would say try it out for yourself see if you like cupcakes made the Sprinkles way,negative,109,100-150,599,500-1000
I may need an intervention on my cream puff addition These are just the right size excellent pastry and chocolate but the filling is sublime Their blueberry lemon scone are moist and flavorful ,positive,34,25-50,197,<500
I was highly disappointed The pictures look very nice The advertising worked cause it made me walk to the Bakery and purchase a piece of the chocolate iced rainbow cake Such a disappointment cause the cake layers are DRY The chocolate icing was decent But the layers were so dry that you cant pick up any of the vanilla flavor Presentation looks good Even in the cake vending machines at the Harrahs casino it looks good But dont let the looks fool you If you like dry cakes then youre in for a treat But they wont be getting my business anymore,negative,102,100-150,561,500-1000
Surely I thought t the long wait in line would reward me with exceptional pastries sandwich  drink Not The mixed berry fruit tart was subpar My turkey  cranberry sandwich hardly had any sauce or cheese It didnt even look appetizing Our hot drinks were just as gio good as Starbucks Very disappointed for the money I spent,negative,59,50-75,332,<500
The operating hours are not accurate they should be updated to reflect that they close when they sell out which is no specific time I went to take my 8 year old son who loves donuts more than anything he opened the door to walk in and was confronted by a very much less than friendly lady who dang near closed the door on his foot while saying very unpleasantly were closed I tried to ask her what would be the best time to come and she answered we are open until we sell out Still trying to close the door on my son this doesnt give me a good vibe or a feeling that I want to return when they do open if your closed thats fine if your having a bad day fine but learn some customer service skills especially when dealing with children I will NOT be returning to patronize this business,negative,155,150-200,799,500-1000
I dont recommend this specific location Im from Seattle and so far I only like that location unfortunately One of the employees was so disrespectful I dont like writing negative reviews but it was uncalled for and each time I come here its always negative I genuinely hope they get better because I love 85 and due to me not being in Seattle this is the only location I can get to,negative,72,50-75,388,<500

Delicious food The breakfast sandwiches are a 1010 Great atmosphere Be careful not to come during peak hours because the line can be very long and you might have a hard time finding a seat but its worth it,positive,39,25-50,212,<500
DELICIOUS but too expensive for what it was to get full stars I loved the options and Im definitely happy I ordered the ice cream with the marshmallow and macaroon However I feel like the macaroons arent as great as other macaroons Ive had and for the price I think each component should be delicious on its own Again Im still super happy I tried this out and the marshmallow is a MUST,positive,73,50-75,396,<500
This place was so good The kids loved the ice cream and the adults loved the boba The staff and owner were so sweet and kind We were only visiting for the day but we would def go back,positive,39,25-50,188,<500

Very good homemade ice cream in funky little part of town When we drove into this area it was hard for me to keep my eyes on the road because there was so much graffiti art on all the buildings In fact the whole block is covered in graffiti and it is something to see Melt is tucked away in a little old house that was converted into retail spaces and is very cool They serve all homemade ice cream and condiments I got the salted caramel ice cream with homemade whipped cream and it was excellent There are also other establishments on this what was once a residential block street including vintage clothing shop coffee shop a bar and some more I cant really remember right now If you have not been down to Melt you should check it out I would go in the colder months so you can sit outside and take in all the atmosphere,positive,159,150-200,840,500-1000
Cmon its the CAKE BOSS That AUTOMATICALLY leads to high expectations One of the few shows our family watched together cuz Buddy and Crew are FUNNY and had some good family fun and creativity So we just HAD TO sink our chops into the yummies offered at their shop in The Venetian despite the overwhelming negative reviews on yelp Its THE CAKE BOSS Could it REALLY be THAT bad Its actually a challenge to find it for first timers Its in its own alcove right across from Buddys Ristorante NOT in the main area of The Shops At The Venetian but rather at the Las Vegas Blvd entrance on The Palazzo side next level up from street level We came on a Saturday early afternoon and it took 27min to get out of the line and into the bakery then 21 min to walk out with the goods GEEZO Longest time Ive ever spent in a bakery We indulged our sweet tooths to a few things The LOBSTER TAIL Yummy Nicely crunchy  flaky with a perfect amount of cream filling The Large CANNOLI and Large CHOCOLATECOVERED CANNOLI Unfortunately this specialty item was disappointing The shell didnt taste crispy fresh the filling wasnt as creamy as Ive had and a little too sweet The chocolate covering masked the staleness of the cannoli shell so I liked that one better The RED VELVET CUPCAKE Sadly Ive had better heretoo Tasted a few days old and not very moist So it took forever to complete the process We interacted with our order taker THREE times once to take our order once to show us what she put in the box then finally to pay for it 21 min to get already made goods Way too long Most of what we ordered weve had better quality elsewhere AND we paid a pretty penny for almost nothing worth the cost Buddy ya let us down ,negative,322,300- 500,1774,1500-2000
The owners take so much pride in what they do and they were so welcoming They encouraged us to try all of the flavors and I tried quite a few I shared a donut with chocolate and Oreo topping with my friend and had a separate scoop of coconut lime sorbet Both were awesome We were there at 630 on a Friday before there were lines Theres no inside seating so dress appropriately I highly recommend,positive,76,75-100,408,<500
I was very excited to try this place but it was not like I expected it to be Seeing the long line I thought it would taste great but once I entered the location the bakery items looked very average I knew by its appearance that desserts would not be what the hype was about but I really wanted to give it a try telling myself that something has to be great with everyone sanding in line for a treat I ordered the most popular thing on their shelf and let me tell you it was most definitely not good at all I ordered 2 lobster tails 1 strawberry shortcake and 1 chocolate hazelnut cupcake  27 later I am left unpleasantly dissatisfied One plus was the very helpful clerk behind the counter,negative,133,100-150,700,500-1000

The softserve is way too sweet and has a strange Splendalike aftertaste The flavors tasted very artificial and I ended up with a stomach ache when I got home I really dont recommend this place your simple Baskin Robbins is much better,negative,42,25-50,244,<500
Despite the mediocre reviews and peoples disappointment over the hype of Milk Bar I still have to praise their soft serve People say smell and taste illicit the strongest of memories and thats probably why tasting cereal milk soft serve topped with cornflakes is so nostalgic for me I realize it is probably one of the most overpriced soft serves in the country but I will gladly pay 6 1 cornflakes topping for a piece of my childhood The soft serve is thicker than typical and each spoonful literally reminds me of the bottom of a bowl of cornflakes Outstanding As for the other soft serves I wasnt a big fan of the fruity pebbles soft serve or the crack pie version For me I like it pretty simple They do offer samples for you to try should you want to taste before ordering In terms of the cookies and pies these definitely go into the overpriced and over hyped category Years ago when I first tried their cookies at the original Milk Bar in NYC the cookies were sold in display cases instead of being wrapped in cellophane At that time I thought the compost cookie was the best thing since sliced bread Now I think the cookies taste stale and mass produced The crack pie is also no longer crack to me It was so overtly sweet that I couldnt understand why I liked it before However that isnt to say I wont return for the soft serve Yum,positive,251,250-300,1376,1000-1500
Masons does it again Theyve been doing a test run on these Korean cheese corn dogs literally all over social media and they really hit the nail on the head I believe theyre the only restaurant in the Cleveland area serving these The cold noodles are vegan friendly and the noodles are perfectly chewy and seasoned so well Pro tip get to masons right at opening time to get your hands on the corn dogsthey sell out quick,positive,78,75-100,432,<500
Out of all the places we ate this one was the biggest disappointment because everyone hyped it up I had never tried a cannoli and I am keto so for this trip I was breaking keto to try a cannoli we ordered a box that had two kinds of cannolis a lobster tail a cookie and a piece of rainbow cake only the cookie was edible the rest was hard and stale I expected the cannoli to be creamy and delicious it was not and the worst was the lobster tail it tasted really bitter like bad oil,negative,98,75-100,483,<500
Came here based on 5 STAR YELP reviews I should have just ordered what the reviewers were raving about and I would most likely been pleased with my order The service was great plenty of seating parking and easy to find The two tiny scoops of ice cream on my sundae were a big letdown This is the smallest scoop of ice cream I have ever been served Unlike others YELP reviewers I did not find the ice cream to be anything extra special hence my rating them 2 stars And hot fudge squeezed out of a plastic bottle I went and searched to see sundae reviews and turns out other feel the same but those reviews are not featured Again this was a disappointment Stay away from the sundaes,negative,130,100-150,701,500-1000
I came here in search of delicious macarons and boy did they fail I read so many rave reviews on yelp regarding the macarons Their macarons are DISGUSTING They tasted like gummy crackers gone wrong nothing close to what a macaron should taste like We bought four to split between the two of us my husband and I and we ended up tossing all four in the trash around the corner Yuck,negative,72,50-75,388,<500
Went here to try out their ice cream since theyre highly rated Got half a scoop of the Mackinac fudge ice cream and coconut almond bliss It was so good Very rich and creamy,positive,34,25-50,176,<500
Ice cream here is slightly above average but every other aspect of this experience isnt There could be one person in front of you in line ordering a scoop and you will still wait 20 minutes This place is always understaffed and the service is unfriendly I would suggest putting a larger menu in front of the glass so those in line could make their decision while they wait Not worth it,negative,72,50-75,392,<500
Twice now treats from this joint have given my family food poisoning They have a sign saying to keep everything you purchase refrigerated so I imagine this is an ongoing problem First my husband got sick off a cookie six months ago This morning my daughter is sick after have a cupcake for dessert last night Never again Obviously they have an issue if they expect everyone to eat cold pastries Maybe they need to cook things properly in the first place Have heard from a friend she and her family have become ill after eating here Too bad had hoped it was just my family Feel for people on vacation who get sick here,negative,115,100-150,631,500-1000
We were looking for deserts to take it back to the room because we were so full after dinner and we found this place from Venetian website Unfortunately it was not what we expected This is the store inside Venetian From the look all their baking products there was nothing impressive at all We went ahead and got a slice of chocolate cake that ready packed in a clear plastic container and a white chocolate mousse to take it back to our room The cake was overwhelmingly sweet like a grocery store bought cake There was no quality into it One would expect the store in a nice hotel like this would make high end deserts not this one though Go some place else if you want a high end dessert from a Michelin Chef But if you dont mind just a piece of cake load nothing but sugar this is for you,negative,153,150-200,805,500-1000
Excellent quality goods Would highly recommend the soft serve Cereal Milk for the hot Vegas afternoons The flavors gives you a sense of Saturday morning cartoon nostalgia Dont be afraid to ask for a sample before ordering staff are super friendly Another great find,positive,44,25-50,272,<500
Another highly overrated California transplant comes to Vegas Cupcakes are good but certainly NOT worth the price charged for themLOCALS stick to Freedswe know better Ice Cream was pretty good had Capn Crunch in a waffle Conethe amount of ice cream didnt even come to the rim of the of the cone This for almost 5 bucksonce again go ahead and soak the tourists but locals know better Very confusing when you walk through the door i guess it is a nice place to take someone coming to town but not worth a trip down to the strip specifically,negative,99,75-100,558,500-1000
Got milked for 20 and came up sour Literally threw everything I bought in the garbage Not sure who is handing the awards for this butno The experience was like waking up excited for the last bit of your favorite cereal and pouring some cold clumpy sour milk in the bowl Yeah its that great,negative,55,50-75,304,<500
Back around Thanksgiving 2019 I called around for a carrot cake and this place popped up on my radar What I didnt ask and assumed was that they had carrot cakes available the day of When i arrived i was told its a weekend item and available on weekdays if you call ahead One of the team members did me a solid and whipped one up for me Instructed me to come back later I was more than happy The carrot cake was well received by the birthday person and everyone loved it Theres a white chocolate sheet that runs through the middle of the cake and gives it a crunch That was amazing in texture and flavor I would say the lobster tail pastry was just a tad stale but nothing to stop me from buying more in the future A few days later we stopped in for coffee and dessert All the desserts were on par to the quality of the carrot cake It was unanimous the coffees were not exactly the best Ill keep coming back for their dessert but probably get my coffee fix elsewhere Its street parking,positive,192,150-200,1005,1000-1500
I usually do not write reviews but after having the experience I had with this company i just had to share Ameliess is one of the most unprofessional companies I have ever seen Let me explain why I am having a wedding this August so my fiancÃ contacted the company asking about wedding cakes The email reply she received was very vague and stating that we need to pay 15 to receive a tasting box We could have a consultation after receiving the box They did not tell my fiance that we can not pay at the store So my fiancÃ wrote them back an email saying they should have told her that she could not pay at the store to receive the cake They went on to make her feel like she was the one at fault and that she should have already known that they only take payment over the phone with a card for the tasting box How are your customers supposed to know this information if you do not tell them If we can not pay at the store then you should probably tell us this in the initial email So after we pay for the cake sample box we go to the store to pick it up and then after trying the cake my fiance wrote them another email to set up a consultation So they only do consultations during normal business hours which is fine It is now Tuesday and we told Betonya that we could meet Friday after 2p and she emailed us back setting the meeting time at 3p So we get to the store at 3p and ask for Betonya The gentleman behind the counter goes to the back and comes back up front saying that she was not there today We told him she set a meeting for us at 3p He was nice and went back to find out what was going on He came back and said that she was not feeling well so she is not here today So did Betonya not find the courtesy to let us know that she was not going to be in today or at least let someone know that we are coming We live 45 minutes away from the store and to come to an appointment set by the company and then being stood up is very unprofessional After telling the gentleman that we drove 45 minutes to get there and she had set the date and time he went back again and came out with two ladies They were going to do the consultation for us but said they would have to relay the information we talked about to Betonya before letting us know anything We did the consultation with them and left My major concern is the unprofessionalism displayed by Betonya by not informing her customers that she set a time up with that she would need to reschedule Very disappointed with this experience For this reason I will not return and will tell everyone I know about this awful experience,negative,512,500+,2633,2000+
5 of us had 15 donuts to share between us Every single one was delicious The smores big poppa tart is an amazing creation The lemon pistachio was shockingly our favorite donut Lots of flavor Staff was very friendly The only negative was the limited seating area,positive,47,25-50,269,<500
The worst We purchased two cookies that tasted extremely stale so we went down the next morning to ask if we can return them or exchange them for something else The cashier called the manager Katie who I explained the situation to and she very rudely and quickly snatched the cookies and receipt out of my hands and handed me two of the same cookies I was just dumbfounded by the interaction and how snippy and poormannered she was We are from NYC and we know what the cookies usually taste like I did not want the same ones and didnt appreciate the entire interaction I can see why this spot has poor reviews 1 star for the poor tasting cookies Zero stars for service,negative,125,100-150,679,500-1000
I imagine Prestis is the kind of place you fall in love with as a kid  big lights big glow big pastries big bread big slices  but nostalgia is what keeps you coming back more than the quality of the food We came here for lunch on a rainy Saturday The service is by number at the counter which is a bit chaotic as the counter is long and orders can be taken at any point along the counter assembled and then funneled down to one of the cash registers You might think there is a line but that is not the case Thankfully the staff taking your particular order will call your number LOUDLY and get the process started The food and pastry offerings are longer than the counter if its even remotely Italian they have it for you We ordered chicken piccata broccoli salad pizza sausage and cassata and an apple turnover for dessert Liked the desserts fresh crust on the pizza and the pastapizza sauce all mainly because these items are easy to make ahead and they get a little better with time Not so with the chicken and the sausage  the piccata sauce and pasta were gummy from the steam table and the sausage dry from being reheated The broccoli salad was good but the florets were huge and cutting raw broccoli with a butter knife is awkward at best It is a lot of food though  so we definitely ate our fill on what we did prefer Great place to come with family who have varied tastes andor for a decadent dessert but next time wed just stop in for dessert and an espresso to go,negative,285,250-300,1514,1500-2000
Quite possibly my most favoritest place in Vegas I found it on my last trip in March of 2009 and tasted the best cheese danish I have ever had in my life Flaky pastrydelicious not too sweet sweet cheesein perfect ratio This weekend I revisited only to be completely impressed with the chocolate tart Super chocolately without being overwhelming and the tart was the perfect texture not too thick or chewy with just the right amount of crispness It was so good I brought one back home for my hubby and he loved it I will say though that I did try the huge red velvet cupcake once and that was not perfect It was a little dry on the inside While I wouldnt call the prices affordable they are low by Vegas standards and in line with prices for such things in San Francisco I wont be going back to Vegas anytime soon but in the meantime Ill just dream about this place until Thomas Keller one day realizes that the residents of SF would probably swarm this place,positive,180,150-200,986,500-1000
Absolutely loved this place Drove 20 minutes to get here after hearing about the donut creation It was perfect I worked at a fancy artisan icecream shop for over 2 years and this had them beat by far Our new favorite place,positive,42,25-50,227,<500

HORRIBLE HORRIBLE HORRIBLE service We walk in at 630pm after 20 min walk to this hithole of a place only to have their lone employee say this is all we have when we see 20 pieces of paltry pastries We ask for coffee and she satisfyingly says we dont have that either as if thats satisfying to her Mind you this business says they are open until 9pm and coffee is their main staple yet they are out at 630pm and pastry counter looks abysmally empty Word to Bouchon ownership Learn how to run a business  you do not belong in a world class hotel like the Venetian when you cant even keep your main product stocked for customers nearly 3 hours before your closing time Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else,negative,135,100-150,724,500-1000
Im not sure how any one can give less than 5 stars Delicious rich home made ice cream Get the 4 scoop sampler for 425 and try a few flavors Yum My suggestions are the Graham Central Station Blueberry Cobbler and Banana Cream Pie And its a walk up orderpickup window so sit outside and enjoy,positive,56,50-75,306,<500
Jeeze oh Pete youd thot I brought in a box of lobster tails last Friday morning There werent many people in the office for Good Friday so I grabbed just short of two dozen thinking I would be taking home a few when the office closed Yeah right They saw the label on the box and went all Spider Monkey crazy and NOTHING was left after about an hour Holy crap coworkersSure I got the obligatory thanks buddy and oooh I LOOOOOOOOOOVE Jack Frost But youda thunk that these people hadnt EVER had a doughnut before So now I sit here rethinking putting out extra Easter candy as the Maelstrom might return I think I will be fine though as commercial candy does NOT compare to Jack Frost Donuts Right,positive,130,100-150,731,500-1000
Great atmosphere first time here was on a first date and it was an excellent choice to end a first date Loved the pecan tart Definitely my favorite,positive,28,25-50,151,<500
Extremely underwhelmed The bakery is down a hall where there is only another restaurant It is small and really nothing to look at The icing on my cupcake was hard and the sponge was very dry My friends cookie with sprinkles was dry  hard Neither bakery item tasted good nor was it fresh in my opinion Sorry to say a major letdown this place was Now I see why Buddy was a sore loser when he lost a challenge to Duff Goldman,negative,83,75-100,431,<500
Keep on keepin on I brought my sister in law here for some ice cream she was a first timer and the guy that helped us was WONDERFUL He let her taste test 3 flavors so she could make her decision usually people get annoyed by that request not Churn Our dishes were DELISH and weve been back since Love this place,positive,62,50-75,323,<500
I wouldnt recommend this place for milk tea The wait was ridiculously long and there werent that many people there Additionally they said that it would be a 1520 min wait for tapioca Id understand if it was later in the day but it was around 1130am and no one was there,negative,52,50-75,280,<500
I love the cake boss show and all of their spin off Shows as well Its been a long time that Ive been waiting to try Buddies bakery goods specially their red velvet cupcake as Carlos so many times teaches other bakers how to master it and its staple cream cheese frosting So after 20 minutes in line my husband and I finally got to the ordering panel By the time we got there there was no tiramisu So my husband ordered a strawberry short cake I ordered the oh so famous red velvet cupcake After another 15 minutes waiting for our order we finally got our goods Everything was just ok I was NOT expecting just ok The red velvet cupcake looked like a cupcake I can get at traders joes Tasted ok nothing woow My husbands strawberry short cake was tasty but not tasty enough for that price Even an amazing dessert at a fancy place is slightly cheaper I wanted to love this place But not impressed at all,negative,172,150-200,929,500-1000

I was so disappointed After watching all of his shows for years I was excited to find out he had a location in Vegas The cannolis were not good The filling was dry and left a weird feeling in your mouth The cupcakes were like eating air light with no flavor The cookies were good but can get anywhere We bought a fondant cake and it was 50 We put in the freezer for later use but wont share with anyone because were afraid it would be not up to par Congrats on his success but quality control is needed Ill never go back,negative,104,100-150,538,500-1000
If Im going to burn calories it should be worth my sweat The place is in a remote area and the ice cream was a hair shy above frys Im all for promoting local businesses yet it seems like they just wheeled in a few coolers purchase art work with a Fat Albert look alike decor to spice up the location and this makes this place awesome Invest in your products order enough macaroons to fulfill your weekend crowd and make your ice cream taste less frost bitten and then we can speak awesome,negative,94,75-100,499,<500
Excellent Freezie Salted Carmel Oatmeal cookie freezie was the bomb and the biodegradable spoons are so cute and sturdy,positive,19,<50,126,<500

The best ice cream shop Ive ever been to The good smells hit you walking in Often times there is a line out the door in the summer but it moves fast Behind the huge counter are huge glass windows where you can see the factory where they make the ice cream Very clean and modern inside with plenty of seating making it a comfortable place to hang out with friends Highly recommend,positive,73,50-75,386,<500
Hmmm I did not know that the French Macarons get stale if not refrigerated for some time Boo You are far less crowded if compared to your Colombus Circle counterpart which is a big plus to me,positive,37,25-50,195,<500
This place is adorable and the staff was incredibly friendly I was visiting from out of town and happened to stumble upon this place Im so glad I did I always seek out vegan donuts when I travel and this little shop blew me away Some of the best donuts Ive ever had I tried the cookie dough hibiscus sprinkle cookies and cream and lemon lavender They were all incredible but the cookie dough stole the show Will definitely be back when Im in town again,positive,86,75-100,467,<500
Never be turned off by the line It is worth the wait which is never that bad and goes by fairly quickly My favorite thing to get there is an arctic blast with cookie dough,positive,35,25-50,175,<500

My father and I took a trip to Paris last year with a few other family members Upon our return to the states he found Amelies and has been talking about it ever since Im in Charlotte visiting and finally got to go this morningif I lived in the area full time Id be at Amelies once a week The decor is awesome  French shabby chic  and the food is even better The chocolate croissant was a very good replication of my favorite French breakfast though the chocolate is a bit sweeter than its French counterpart and they have macarons Ill definitely be back soon to try a breakfast sandwhich and more pastries,positive,115,100-150,629,500-1000
Honestly didnt like any of their soft serve flavors I tried all three I also didnt like the cornflake crunch it was pretty salty and I was expecting sweet pretty disappointing considering all the raving reviews I had been hearing from people,negative,42,25-50,248,<500
I really dont care for this place The cookies are ok the Crack Pie is pretty good The soft ice cream is pretty good but nothing is great But its kind of expensive so Ive gotta give it a two,negative,40,25-50,198,<500
Cute place in the cut I was looking for somewhere to get pastries after dinner and Amelies had a very little selection that night so I found this on Yelp and Im glad I did They only allow 2 in at a time so be prepared to stand outside if it is a busy time They move you in and out pretty quickly though I got a cannoli and crumb cake Both were delicious and hit the spot There was a nice selection of goodies so Im sure anyone can find something they like Now I know where I can get something sweet,positive,103,100-150,509,500-1000
A very delicious bakery but I do think its suited best for people with a certain taste I like my cakes and icing very sweet and soft and I find the icing style here to be much more on the buttery and thick side less on the sweet side They have classic flavors and more experimental flavors but nothing too out of the box and I think everything works really well The indoor space is beautiful almost Victorian decorated and they have a small back patio you can sit at,positive,90,75-100,479,<500
Its was yummy  I got salty caramel cupcake  I shouldve get more IF ONLY the price is low but I understand its cost cuz its at the strip  lols,positive,31,25-50,146,<500

If I had not been so busy shoveling blondies covered in butterscotch and the most decadent soft serve Ive tasted I wouldve gotten a photo Though there were limits with supply chain issues no dairy free or caramel the day we went the line moved fast and the staff were quick and offered options Next time were in PGH were heading back,positive,62,50-75,342,<500
HmmIm in shock that I havent reviewed Sweet Republic sooner This place was one of my favorites when I lived in Phoenix so I assumed I had already written a reviewmy apologies SR Good thing I made it out for a visit this past weekend and made sure to stop by for some dessert after dinner This place is so cute and has the greatest flavor combinations ever I would love to sample all of the different flavor creations as they are so intriguing but I always feel bad about holding up the line There is usually always a nice crowd in this shopnot crazy busy but good steady business Who am I to delay people from their yummy goodness that is SRs ice cream In any case I usually end up going with tried and true favorites like I Love Bacon and Salted Caramel This time around they didnt have the bacon ice cream so I went with their Sweet Potato and it was so delicious Definitely put me in the mood for Thanksgiving The quality of their ice cream is really great and you just cant beat some of their exciting flavor combinations Basil Lime is so refreshing When we lived in AZ we would always take our out of town guests here for some treats Dont forget to pick up a pack of Bacon Brittle at the register,positive,231,200-250,1232,1000-1500
Blah stale donuts For 17 I got 3 Donuts 2 coffees Selection was small for 1030 on a Monday so I had to pick what was left or they offered me an ice cream for breakfast apple fritter was rock hard strawberry cheesecake donut tasted like a regular jelly filled donut and birthday donut was a regular sprinkled donut nothing special Very disappointing Used to newer donut shops were donuts are made fresh per hour sidecar dough donuts,negative,78,75-100,450,<500
The cereal ice cream from here is great The ice cream was smooth and not too sweet I added corn flakes which added another level of texture to the ice cream My only problem with milk bar was that it was pretty pricey compared to other ice cream places that serve a similar product but its expected from an ice cream place in the cosmopolitan Definately will try the ice cream with the bun next time Ill be back definately would recommend,positive,82,75-100,446,<500
I was excited to go to Milk Bar as I have been to the one in NY and loved it here I was pretty disappointed The soft serve was salty The texture was spot on to how I remember but the flavors were very flat I remember there being a harmonious play between savory and sweet and instead there was a strange flat salty flavor with almost no sweet Plus the pricing was extremely expensive with miniscule portions The crack pie had great flavor but the serving size was literally the size of a restaurant match book ,negative,98,75-100,530,500-1000
Its a little on the pricy side for ice cream but worth every penny The ice cream is delicious and options well varied the staff friendly everything clean This place is bomb If they have pumpkin spiceGET IT the salted Carmel is made in house as is the phenomenal toffee Worth the drive and expense,positive,55,50-75,310,<500

I FINALLY GOT TO TRY THEIR CEREAL MILK ICE CREAM Sorry for the caps I was just that excited I tried some of their goodies corn cookie cake truffles before but since I havent made it out to NY since before Y2K I had not been able to try the ice cream Until now I love milk flavored ice cream which my fiance finds ironic because I dont like to drink milk Furthermore I love the milk leftover from my cereal bowl The fact that they put it in an ice cream makes me so happy I got the classic cereal milk ice cream with corn flake topping NOTE THIS IS NOT A SUPER SWEET ICE CREAM If youre expecting a lot of sweetness this is not for you I really enjoyed it If youre into the sweeter things they have a fruity cereal milk ice cream which tastes like the milk leftover after Froot Loops or Fruity Pebbles I tried the sample of this one and it was good but I preferred the original cereal milk I also bought a dozen cookies to take home with me There were literally 10 corn cookies and 2 compost cookies Those corn cookies are my favorite cookies of all time Period They almost taste like a sweet cornbread I LOVE them I do want to come back and trie the crack pie next time I come back Its on my list,positive,239,200-250,1234,1000-1500
Update Ghirardelli contacted me regarding our experience and apologized for how we were treated Since they have shown their determination to customer satisfaction I wanted to change my rating to 4 stars I hope that with the changes made people will be treated with respect TERRIBLE SERVICE I walked in ready to buy a bunch of chocolates I had my mask on but my husband had a drink so he wasnt wearing one The guy behind the counter very rudely told my husband to put his mask on When my husband turned around to show him he was drinking the guy told him to either put his mask on his ear or to leave the store meanwhile there were 5 other people eating and drinking that he did not tell this to We have no problem wearing masks but this was ridiculous and no one should be treated like this especially loyal customers We walked out and will not be back here,positive,162,150-200,871,500-1000

Mary Coyle has been around for decades and a fan favorite for the Phoenix veterans Its an ice cream favorite for many and visits usually will bring fond memories of childhood experiences They have moved several times and to be honest this current location isnt great Parking is not in the least bit accommodating Frankly its actually a pain And the fact that it was a Friday evening and very few customers visited while we were there I dont think I am alone in this opinion The ice cream is still great and the menu is not far off years past but the feeling and vibe once present in the past days ice cream parlor are fading It just doesnt feel the same Still its great ice cream and I am glad they are still in existence Like many other historic venues the past feels dissipate and leave you a bit saddened at the reality we are getting OLD Damn that really stinks to get old LOL Be sure to stop by and share some love Its Ice Cream You need it in your life ,positive,186,150-200,997,500-1000
I brought my children along with 2 nephews to Las Vegas for my sons birthday They were excited to go to the bakery On Saturday we got there and got 67 they were on 25 an hour later they were on number 33 The staff was extremely slow and seemed to be in no rush whatsoever Sunday morning we went again at 830am thinking they wouldnt have such a long wait and again we got number 67 This time they were on number 47 This is what I dont understand if they have two people helping the customers and they each take 1015 minutes per customer then the cashier isnt doing anything for 10 minutes at a time After 30 minutes we left they only moved up 4 numbers My son was extremely disappointed and it was a sour end to his birthday A person would think that they would put at least 4 people during peek times,negative,158,150-200,818,500-1000
this review is strictly for this location  the one above Walgreens My husband and i have been long time fans of bouchon bakery so much that we have to stop by each time we leave our must gets are usually the ham and cheese croissant and ham and cheese sandwich  turkey sandwich This past weekend  easter  we stayed at the palazzo and walked to this tucked away location thinking we could beat the line we got there and were the only ones there so here we were thinking yay we scored The girl behind the counter did not greet us right away not that it mattered if she was busy  but she wasnt and when she did she was not very friendly I placed my order of the ham and cheese croissant and waiting for it to be heated up IN the meantime my husband wanted to place an additional order but this girl was just ignoring him It took almost like 2 minutes before she asked if he needed some help or if he wanted to order yeah granted we came together maybe that can be confusing but i thought it was pretty obvious that he needed to place to order Anyways after 2 minutes she finally acknowledged that we wanted more sandwiches Again she was not friendly and almost borderline giving us an attitude But we didnt say anything we just stayed quiet and just waited patiently for our sandwiches At the other locations the staff normally would put the whole sandwich in the panini press but this girl she took the sandwich apart and then heated it  it just seemed so different  but the main reason for this review was bc both my husband and i got food poisoning from these sandwiches we got  I dont know if its bc of the location  that they may not get the most fresh items or if the assembly of these sandwiches went wrong but for now  im definitely staying away from bouchon some may say  maybe its something else we ate or drank that day  but to make it simple those sandwiches were the only thing we ate that day before we headed back home and water was the only thing we drank  bottled we are soo disappointed,negative,392,300- 500,2063,2000+
Do yourself a huge favor and get the Cereal Milk Soft Serve with Cereal toppings the cereal topping is a MUSTTT I love that Milk Bar puts the toppings on top AND on bottom way to think things through and perfectly execute the soft serve I always love the ice cream toppings and get so sad when I reach the bottom and all thats left is ice cream with no crunchies but no fear Milk Bar gives you the perfect solution to this Sober drunk morning night afternoon no matter what time or what condition youre in Milk Bar is delicious,positive,101,100-150,545,500-1000
Best ice cream around Had chocolate birthday cake with a red velvet macaroon and homemade marshmallow Omg I meant to give it 5 stars Not one debbie,negative,27,25-50,151,<500
This little kiosk exists right at the entrance to the Phantom theater They offer paninis and muffins and other assorted treats but the reason to stop is the macaroons There are several flavors including chocolate raspberry and pistachio If you buy five you get the sixth free and you can pick your own flavors you do not have to get the premade sampler packs The coffee brewed here is drinkable so if you need an energy boost the have ice cold Red Bull and even champagne splits which go quite nicely together Only in Vegas can you enjoy a classic French macaroon while sipping champagne and Red Bull and not be the oddest character in sight,positive,116,100-150,654,500-1000

I go to Amelies because of their free Wi Fi even though it is pretty slow and unsecured and delicious bold coffee I dont know how someone cant like Amelies its such an eclectic mix of everythingdecor people pastries smiles hipsters and drinks Of course the one thing that Amelies has that many other places dont is the open 24 hoursfactor That is one of my major gripes about places in this area since I moved from the west where there seemed to be alot more 24 hours places Why dont more businesses in the area see that that right there is a cash cow Plus I believe freaks come out at night so its a fabulous people watching experience Anywho the fact that they are open 24 hours and I actually feel safe walking to and from my car at 1AM or 2AM is a major plus Their chai latte is one of the best Ive had and I keep swearing I am going to try more of their pastries but my booty begs me not to I love Ameliesmore businesses should take after them,positive,186,150-200,988,500-1000
Have been to New York several times but never been able to come here because its been busy and always out of the way We got the lobster tail and the confetti cake The lobster tail is amazing and it is a must if you ever come here It is so crunchy and not burnt and the cream filling is not too sweet at all its the perfect amount of sweet and whippedness not a word I know The way the lobster tail crumbles when you bite into it with the perfect amount of crisp is genius The confetti cake on the other hand was way too sweet I did not like it one single bit I which theyre able to use the same custard  cream filling in the lobster tail as the icing for the cake That would be incredible I truly found the cake way too dense and way too sweet Two pairings that make it overwhelming Overall 10 out of 10 would recommend the lobster tail 510 would recommend the cake and 710 would recommend coming here It is quite over priced,positive,186,150-200,955,500-1000
We were referred here by friends or at least I think they were friends What a disappointment Seriously if you want good ice cream go to the grocery store and buy some pints of Talenti Its much better ice cream at a much more reasonable price And chances are the grocery store clerks will treat you better than the staff at Churn Mediocre ice cream at high prices with lousy staff and very limited seating I see that Mikey R had the same thoughts on 51620 although Mikey was much more generous with his ratings I had coconut gelato and lemon gelato Ive eaten gelato around the world and this was the worst gelato I have ever eaten Never again,negative,120,100-150,661,500-1000
Im doing a late review a year late but o well I think Carlos Bake Shop met all expectations of mine Being a fan of the show I knew what to expect long lines and a variety of pastries The line was actually not too bad for me it was somewhat long but this is a tourist spot so I really didnt mind I went for the infamous lobster tail and regular canoli which I have never tried so I really didnt know what they SHOULD taste like i thought they were good the lobster tail was flaky on the outside and the creamy inside was super sweet The canoli was pretty similar in taste for me The next time I go I wont get the same thing just because there is a lot more sweet goodness I want to try The people writing all these horrendous reviews about Carlos Bake Shop need to not be so criticalIts a famous Bake shop so expect a long line and pick and chose wisely your fault if you dont like what you picked lol all bakers are different so have an open mind gosh lol,positive,193,150-200,986,500-1000

First this is a very small stand with no tables Second the cake I bought was dry and not fresh Maybe it was better on the morning but I could not finish it and threw it away My mom is a professional baker so I am a little spoiled but this one is definitely not a 4star bakery,negative,58,50-75,285,<500
Not sure what the fuck is wrong with the staff here Dont go into the service industry if you cant communicate with customers Was scoffed at treated like a burden and ignored particularly by a taller young lady with a bob haircut and a beret Treated us like trash the entire time and laughed at us while we left the establishment Ive worked in 4 different restaurants so I understand how chaotic it can be however this was just egregious Enjoyed this place the first two times but will not be returning,negative,92,75-100,513,500-1000
We got their croissant focaccia bread with feta cheese and tomatoes and vanilla bean macaron and pistachio maracons Their croissant was OK not great it didnt taste really fresh and the inside wasnt as buttery as I prefer Their focaccia bread was good they warmed it for us and there was a nice pesto soaked into the bread Their vanilla bean macaron was delicious Much better than the pistachio one,positive,70,50-75,411,<500
To be honest it isnt the fault of Bouchon but I thought that this would be a sitdown menu location instead of a small cramped express bakery with outside seating only My group shared the turkey sandwich chocolate croissant and koign aman Sandwich was average Something that you could find anywhere  You can get it toasted though The chocolate almond croissant was pretty good with a chocolate filling and crisp layers of pastry The koign aman was new for me We wanted to try something different but were extremely disappointed It was a chewy sugary eggy bread that had a hint of salt Nothing interesting or revolutionary Wish I had gotten the pain aux rasin instead For the price go to somewhere much nicer and tastier,negative,127,100-150,737,500-1000
Bought extra thick cookies and cream milkshake I couldnt drink it fast enough with a straw Extremely runny from the time it was handed to me Clerks were friendly as they took my money and handed me my liquid shake,negative,40,25-50,218,<500
Cupcake ATM OMG I had to find this I always wanted to go to Sprinkles ever since Ive seen people post photos of their cupcakes and I heard about the place But now that I heard about the ATM the need magnified Sprinkles is located in the outdoor Linq Promenade on the way to the High Roller The ATM is outside by the Sprinkles ice cream side It has a touch screen and is a little more expensive than if you purchase inside the store so buy one for the experience and get the rest inside It was so magical after you pay and you wait for the door to rise and you see that small pink box in the white light Its like heaven opened its doors Yes my heaven will be full of cupcakes We got a red velvet cupcake which was surprisingly pretty moist considering it was probably already boxed and waiting in the ATM lineup to be bought I didnt care for the fondant on their cupcakes but I guess it was more for decoration They have two sides one for cupcake sand one for cookies and ice cream We didnt get to try anything else since we were full but next time we will I finally got my Sprinkles After reading reviews I wish I got to take some home with me since it sounds like they keep pretty well  Sprinkles cupcakes You have a cupcake ATM My dreams have come true,positive,248,200-250,1290,1000-1500
Donut mind if I eat all the donuts here Ive been here a handful of times and each a 5 star experience Their creative donuts like the Big Poppa Tart the size of yo face its a donut w a pop tart in it Smores flavor is delish I love the large backyard a rarity for downtown businesses where I relax w my Vesta coffee or milk Creme brÃlÃe and strawberry split are also inventive and vegan too On this trip I visited with Chef Jeff whom owns the place along w his brother His passion for great service and community involvement has made it a must visit  Open til sold out and sells out quickly on the weekend so get there in the AM,positive,126,100-150,645,500-1000
They are not as good as they were a year ago I didnt see the usual baking crew and there were no vegan donuts left When I went the first time over a year ago the trays were loaded with more on the way Several people walked out without buying anything so I followed themIt just didnt have the same lively upscale vibes as beforeI imagine the former bakers moved onto a different situation Still baking I hope,negative,78,75-100,420,<500
Sadly I had to give this place two stars and thats only because the girls that were working on 35 at 143 had major attitudes We ordered an iced coffee and we received a hot one When we brought it up to their attention they seemed annoyed However the taste was great but they have a lot of improvement to do on their customer service,negative,65,50-75,339,<500

Its macaron not macaroon people So its 11am and Vegas is in the midst of the late morning checkout and breakfast rush Bouchon Bistro upstairs is packed the hotel cafe looks like crap and you just need something to get you going Head to Bouchon Bakery Savoury snacks oversized treats TKOs Yes please and all manner of delectable desserts Theyre open early so you can hook up some delicious baked goods for the flight home or your day out and about and the line moves quickly if there is one One of the most overlooked gems in the Vegas hotels,positive,100,75-100,563,500-1000
Meeeeeh After a tasty and delectable dining experience at Scarpetta I suggested we walk right over to Milk for a post dinner treat All 10 of us ordered something youre welcome Milk Soft Serve was okay but oddly very salty and I am normally a salty cat In fact so were all the cookies we picked up Double Chocolate and Compost cookies I bought 2 Blueberry and Cream cookies but gave them away to friends so I couldnt tell you how those were but also didnt get any feedback from those I gave it to So letdown by Milk and the 80 we spent on Soft Serve and Cookies 80 Even the girl at the register was a little salty too I will say that the Fruity Pebbles Soft Serve was the best because it had more dynamic flavor Otherwise Im happy if we never go back Glad we got to try it though,negative,154,150-200,804,500-1000
Love love Ive been to regular Sprinkles but not Sprinkles ice cream So many different flavors and types to choose from Sprinkles shake sundae cookie sandwich cupcake sandwich etc I decided to get the red velvet cupcake sundae with red velvet ice cream So good I couldnt finish it because it was super sweet with the frosting and ice cream together And I have a big sweet tooth too But overall I enjoyed it Would come again and try more flavors The line was long on a Friday night Service was kinda slow Only like one or two ppl working,positive,100,75-100,555,500-1000
My first time there and I will definitely come again  Everyone was very nice and the lady at the bakery took her time and was patient in describing the different products  I bit into them and was amazed  It was so moist that it melted in my mouth Hmm mmm  Id also like to add that Ive spend 100s on professional cakes for birthdays weddings etc and none of them were as good as just a cupcake at this establishment I hope they cater or make cakes to order  Id love to start getting special made cakes here   Last but not least it is a little pricey as I did spend 12 on a cupcake a small pastry and a drink but it was worth it  Ive spent that and didnt eat all of my food before ,positive,146,100-150,697,500-1000
Delicious as the last few times I cant get enough of Honey Hut Whenever I am in the area I MUST stop by Believe all the 5 star reviews This place is so worth it,positive,35,25-50,167,<500
If youre just driving by this place might be hard to see at first but on a walk through Roosevelt Row the cool front door caught my eye This ice cream shop not only has friendly employees its ice cream is phenomenal The milk is bought from a local dairy and it is yummy Cool flavors that you can sample and they put the ice cream in Chinese take out containers topped with a fortune cookie Cones are also an option If your looking for unique flavorful and friendly this place is for you,positive,94,75-100,498,<500
Visiting from Orlando my family took me to this bakery 20 minutes before closing It was evident that the employees were not happy seeing 10 people come in After we purchased our beveragesdesserts and seated ourselves to indulge within 10 minutes we were approached by a female employee to take away any cups and dishes that we had I was not finished eating my cannoli and she basically hovered like a buzzard until I finished eating it Then to add insult to injury 2 other employees joined her standing in very near proximity waiting for us to finish and depart Extremely disappointed in the lack of customer service inappropriate behavior and made to feel uncomfortable and that our presence was not welcomed,negative,122,100-150,721,500-1000
Ive only been to the one on PinevilleMattews Road Twice I wont be going back This one is quite noisy  LOTS of little kids running around So if youre thinking about sipping your quiet Saturday morning latte while you read the newspaper think again I waited WAY too long for my latte and the prices are outrageously high  as with MOST Charlotte eateries And the pastries are just okay Not terrible  but definitely NOT worth the high prices they charge,negative,83,75-100,468,<500

This is a great local ice cream spot  I really liked the overall vibe and style of the place The flavors are somewhat unusual in a good way and the ice cream is made right here on site Great alternative to the megachains in the area,positive,47,25-50,240,<500
This is honestly my favorite place to get ice cream They make their own ice creams and sorbets Because of this they are able to experiment with new flavors and combinationschipotle bacon anyone Some flavors are out there and some are closer to home but all are rich decadent and delicious Just talking about it is making me crave their Toffee Banoffee Sundae which is a favorite of Alton Brown from the food networkin case you didnt know,positive,78,75-100,457,<500
Nothing much to say here other than its the best Ive cream in Cleveland and in my opinion Ohio From their flavors to consistency Ive had better ice cream here than both Graters or Jennys My only wish was more varied seasonal flavors as theyve had similar yearlong rotations recently,positive,50,25-50,291,<500
We ordered the Cereal Milk Soft Serve with cornflakes and two other shakes I fed my 2 year old son the Cereal Milk Soft Serve at 1230 am He woke up at 5am vomitting He threw up three times since this morning We are on our way back to California to bring him to Urgent Care I also noticed this morning the guy handing out the orders really smell funky Severe bad body odor Should they be putting some attention to their staffs hygiene specially they are handling food Traumatic First time experience here Not coming back for sure,negative,99,75-100,540,500-1000
Just a fun place to visit Really enjoyed the art in the bathroom They are so friendly and have great donuts The milk on tap is pretty cool Would recommend the French toast donut They are very kid friendly as well My son loved his Captain America donut 55 would recommend,positive,51,50-75,279,<500
I dont know who taught yall how to make a cannoli but oh goodness its clear that no one has ever shown you how to strain ricotta cheese so that you dont have to cut it with cream cheese For a cannoli that costs over 6 its pathetic Do better Secondly over 9 for a cake that is no bigger than a chocolate lava cake from dominos Again you can do better Its absolutely shameful that you would charge that amount for that tiny piece of cake Im not discrediting the time effort and cost of ingredients by any means Pictures for comparison with a diet coke can a butter keeper and a McDonalds bbq sauce cup Dont waste your money Youre better off going literally anywhere else,negative,128,100-150,696,500-1000
Just as good as the San Diego location We get a lot of well known eateries from other cities opening in Vegas Not all of them live up to the hype Donut Bar definitely does I came in around 11 am during their soft opening There was a short line that moved quick I was getting donuts for a few people so picked a good variety Caramelized Pineapple Caramel Latte Cake Batter Mud Pie Red Velvet Samoa Chocolate Twix Blueberry Cheesecake Banana Caramel and Apple Fritter Half went to work with Hubby and half came home with me It is hard to pick a favorite but if pressed I would say the Caramel Latte and Samoa were the faves out of the ones I tried They post the next days flavors the night before on social media Check it out before you go so you have an idea of what you want They are listed in store too but the line moves quick so be ready Not all of the varieties fit on the counter so dont miss a flavor because you didnt read the list Dont forget a drink They have Stumptown Cold Brew Nitro Chocolate and Strawberry Milk on tap See you in line,positive,206,200-250,1077,1000-1500
If this is what all of being vegan tastes like sign me up lol its not and dont But these are possibly THE most flavorful doughnuts Ive ever had  as in real fresh natural ingredient flavor not just fried sugar bomb flavor although theres a time and place for that too We visited the first day they reopened after the COVID19 closure  aaaand they were sold out So we returned the next weekend and waited in line for about 30 minutes before finally getting our chance Its a clean and simple interior with lots of big pretty plants a menu board and a counter with all the fresh goodies lined up and waiting to be eaten When we walked in the trays for two of the flavors we wanted most were empty Were so used to this happening see Brewnuts but UNLIKE Brewnuts they had more ready in the back within 2 minutes Its almost like they anticipated which flavors would be popular and planned ahead so that customers wouldnt leave disappointed I appreciate that so much Staff were very friendly and efficient too Way to do business We tried the maple cream lemon lavender blueberry cake strawberry shortcake banana pudding and old fashioned cake There wasnt a bad or even mediocre one in the bunch These are very light and fluffy doughnuts not heavy or dense at all And again the flavors are so fresh and well done that it really put them over the top The maple cream was the sweetest of the bunch and my husband and I both agreed that the strawberry shortcake was our favorite We cant wait to come back and try more of their amazing flavors Support blackowned businesses,positive,288,250-300,1615,1500-2000

Im a local and live in Las Vegas but I rarely go to the strip I was at the Venetian to do some shopping and decided to try Carlos bake shop Ive been wanting to try some pastries from the famous bakery but that excitement was short lived when I had to wait in line for 30 minutes When I FINALLY got to order I only got a chocolate chip and MM cookie and a chocolate cupcake with white frosting Sounds like a home run right NOT The cookie was hard and tasted like it was a couple days old It did taste better after sitting in the car because the chocolate chips and MMS melted but I was disappointed The cupcakeabsolutely DISGUSTING The chocolate cake was dry and stale and didnt even taste like chocolate The frosting tasted like shortening I just threw the whole thing away Its pretty difficult to mess up cookies and cupcakes but Carlos has managed to do so Dont waste your time or money Im a connoisseur of desserts especially cookies and cupcakes but Carlos has it ALL wrong,negative,185,150-200,1010,1000-1500
Very cute little shop in a nondescript location The inside is super cute bright colorful and cheery I love the fact that they sell a lot of their homemade candies marshmallows cookies etc and they are all displayed and packaged very nicely Now on to the ice cream The selection of flavors is varied but not overwhelmingly huge like a lot of places can be They have sorbets on one side of the counter and their ice creams on the other I didnt try any of the sorbets but they looked great While the menu had a ton of great looking sundaes to choose from I ended up creating my own I got a scoop of the espresso and salted butter caramel with salted caramel sauce toffee butter crunch whipped cream and a toasted marshmallow to top it off The blend of flavors all together was excellent Individually the components of the sundae were even better You can tell the ice cream is handmade quality stuff The espresso was smooth and the salted butter caramel my favorite though I didnt quite taste the salted part that much The toffee butter crunch was definitely one of my favorite parts of the sundae and I could have probably just eaten a bag of that The salted caramel sauce complimented the ice cream and was super tasty The grand finale of the toasted marshmallow made for a great presentation though it was difficult to eat in conjunction with the ice cream and I actually ended up taking it off and eating it separately It could have been toasted more but that would obviously have made the ice cream underneath it melt even more than it started to I will definitely be coming back here and trying more things I did also try a sample of the honey blue cheese and it was tasty and unique but not something I could eat a whole scoop of,positive,322,300- 500,1778,1500-2000
Went there on a saturday night Super loud crazy music and people all hovering in front of the flavors Too chaotic Yogurt not particularly good and it does NOT take a particularly good version to please me Dissapointing  just ok,negative,41,25-50,236,<500
Not worth the money The cookies were on the border of being pretty stale  hard They were way too salty  tasted like too much baking soda was added Out of the corn blueberry compost cookies I guess the blueberry was the better one of the 3 But the flavor of all of them was overpowered by baking soda  salt making your tongue dried out  thirsty afterwards A very unpleasant experience The crack pie was just the typical brown sugar butter pie If youve had something like this before then you dont need to try this one It was average at best nothing memorable You will be disappointed I didnt try the ice cream milk shakes or cake so maybe those are Milks better items Those cookies were like eating a salt cube dont do it,negative,139,100-150,747,500-1000

Ummm I had such high expectations of Carlos Bakery Not that a SUPERfan of the show ok more like a minifan but I used to watch on the regular from time to time Now the show will end the same way not only a display of a beautiful cake but also DELICIOUSright Like that one place that starts with a F  and ends with  S I eat the crumbs its so good but this is not a review about that bakery this is about Carlos Bakery Im not saying that it was bad but it wasnt goodto me and yes I had THAT LOOK on my face because I was sadly disappointed We order a canoli and some kind of coconut cookie Lets start off with the COOKIE toasted coconut shortbread cookie toasted coconut and shortbread you cant go wrong Wrong actually you can go very wrong with this A very pretty looking cookie golden brown with a nice dollop of chocolate smack dab in the middle of the cookie Just me personal opinion maybe if it was a chocolate ganache it wouldve helped with the dryness of the cookie Yes shortbread is a dry cookie but you definitely get the butter taste on the palate when you eat it This is a teacoffee type of cookie to me it was just bad all over Super dry we try to break the cooking in half to split cookie so hard that when we finally broke the cookie in half from the force of trying to break the cookie I dropped 1 half on the nasty strip sidewalk No 5second rule here that will just have to sit there Flavor well I could taste the toasted coconut and the chocolate was just there thats all I have for that Traditional Canoli Once again I promise I dont know what was up with yesterdays batch but the 2 items that were purchased were hella overbaked and super hard Canoli should be a light crisp hard enough to maintain structure to absorb the filling and not soften the shell but not where your back molars might be cracked after taking a bite We looked like a hot mess trying to share this canoli on the strip we pretty much just blended in with the other tourists Now the CREAM FILLING now that was DELISH A nice velvet cream with a hint of cinnamon so light  oh I would go back for the cream filling and cream filling only give me a spoon and a bowl As for me going back mehmaybe since the bakery is mainly known for their cakes then maybe I should a slice of cake instead of the other delectable delicatessens in this shop The RED VELVET cake did look good but let me think about this one hmm  Red Velvet Cake huh,negative,477,300- 500,2508,2000+

When you walk into Donut Bar you are a little overwhelmed with all the different donut choices Its super hard to pick just 1 or 2 I tried a few different donuts and I have to admit I was a little disappointed with the taste I think the presentation of the donut out weighs the taste I expected more flavor For example one of the donuts I tried was the snickers donut Now that sounds like it should be wonderful however I didnt taste any hint of snickers flavor it just tasted like a chocolate donut and a little dry too The staff was super friendly and helpful explaining the different flavors But honestly if I lived in Vegas I dont know if Id stop here again,negative,127,100-150,674,500-1000
Went with a friend last night to be treated to a birthday cupcake Thank you Simone Ok now on to the reviewThere were only about 7 flavors left to choose from off their 20 flavors menu Strike 1 While the cupcakes were goodsized they were kind of dry Read not fresh Strike 2 The counter inside the store where we sat to eat our cupcakes as well as the floor underneath said counter was filthy Strike 3 Youre out Dont believe the hype people Ill stick with local favorite The Cupcakery Their Boston Creme cupcake is seriously to die On a side note we stepped over to the ice cream side and got a sample of the Blood Orange sorbet OMFG it was good If I ever go back it will be for that But not if I have to wait in a line outside where a doorman stands and lets you in when hes ready and if youre wearing the proper attire I kid about the attire thing but thats what it felt like Seriously A doorman at an ice cream parlor,negative,183,150-200,962,500-1000

Always heard about Mitchells people raving about it Whenever I pass it by I see lines are out the doors This must be darn good ice creamfrozen yogurt I keep saying to myself Well I finally got my opportunity to try this high demand ice creamno lines straight to the front I decided to try the tasters duomy choices Campfire Smores and Blue Cosmo It was definitely a weird combination mashed together ugh especially when it started to melt I actually thought I was going to be wowedkind of like when I have my Cold Stone Creamery Oreo Overload this is so amazing reaction Nopedidnt happen for me I was just ice creamice cream that I can get at the grocery store Didnt quite understand what the big deal about this place I feel that it is extremely overhyped Price wiseinexpensive which is a good thing I guess when it is not crowded and you are craving for some ice cream while you are out and about in Ohio City I guess you can take 4 bucks and get a frozen treat Otherwise Ill just stop by the store and grab some ice cream and go home,negative,197,150-200,1086,1000-1500
After a night on the town this is a perfect 6am spot Yummy Yummy Yummy The best coffee and pastries Even with the long linewhich went fast the staff was extra friendly and accommodating,positive,34,25-50,191,<500
Dont miss Donut Bar on your next visit to Las Vegas I first heard about it on the YouTube channel SayHiToMatthew and checked it out two days ago over Labor Day weekend The staff is very friendly and helpful and the donuts are amazing The shop is located in the downtown area which I normally try to avoid because of parking issues and vagrants wandering the streets but it was worth the visit I had a donut nearly as big as my head that was topped with chocolate cinnamon and marshmallows and tasted like Mexican hot chocolate So good,positive,99,75-100,543,500-1000
Looks pretty but tastes pretty bad We got the cereal milk ice cream with birthday cake and sprinkles The first bite was extremely unsatisfying and honestly pretty disappointing considering we paid 19 for a pint of it The birthday cake crumbles are super dry and have a distinct salty taste which is so offputting in ice cream The sprinkles are giving everything theyve got to save the entire experience but unfortunately its not enough If I were you Id seriously consider going to one of the extremely overpriced convenience stores in the hotel and getting an overpriced ice cream as itll be better than this and youll still come away spending less money Youve been warned,negative,116,100-150,690,500-1000
My wife and I thought this would be a great place for ice creamwe were wrong The flavors we chose were awful she chose chocolate chip and I chose peanut butter Tasted very bad and we will not be going back Too bad because the staff was really nice and pleasant,negative,51,50-75,268,<500
Pastry was delicious Waiting in line for 30 mins to pay Customer service was horrible 20 people in line to pay with one cashier After 20min they finally opened another register I was disappointedcali bakeries were better as far as services Great bakery but poor service People were leaving due to the line,negative,53,50-75,315,<500

We had the cereal milk boozy shake and the famous crack pie Both were good enough and hit the late night sweet tooth craving Certainly a fun try for one of those things you might not have anywhere else but In Vegas,positive,42,25-50,217,<500
This place was fantastic Well okay I havent actually EATEN there but my boyfriend picked up a slice of pumpkin cheesecake and double chocolate cheesecake from Prestis for my birthday It was FANTASTIC Especially the pumpkin I made him go back and get another slice of pumpkin the following weekend Probably some of the best cheesecake Ive had in my life And Ive had a lot of cheesecake,positive,68,50-75,399,<500
Going into the place the people were nice and the line was long But Since they dont close till 12am wouldnt the amount of cupcakes be replenished There were very few cupcakes left The major issue would be that at checkout while paying I heard an employee ask if she should bring some out from stock So there are more to choose from then 4 different ones Then to my surprise the person whom was asked if she should restock the shelf replied with a not yet A few people in line who were in front of me and behind me were wondering why there were so few and though they seemed a but down about the lack of selection I was disappointed for the lack of customer service in the stocking side of things which VITAL sales and the Las Vegas experience,negative,143,100-150,765,500-1000
Yummy ice cream in a great spot right near quite a few restaurants It is lovely to walk to after a nice dinner The line can definitely get long but its worth it Great flavors and tons of toppings must try the home made cookies,positive,45,25-50,234,<500
My friends and husband brought me here today They had all been here before The friends said we are going for the twice baked almond croissant And it was amazing Yes of course I had to get oneand it was the last one I cant even begin to describe the perfection that I found in this pastry My husband had brought me French macaroons from here before And they were lovely But my god the almond croissant I will have dreams about the almond croissant And thats not all Rebecca was so amazing helping me find the perfect drink I said caffeine hot sweet but not too sweet  salted caramel brownie cafÃ mocha she says without hesitation Ok sounds great No great doesnt even begin to describe how perfect this drink was Milky smooth perfection In the car on the way home we live an hour away I told my husband anytime you want to come here Just say so and we are on our way Thank you Thank you for existing,positive,173,150-200,945,500-1000
This place is awesome The soft serve machine wasnt working so the staff stayed late to make it work so we could get our treats Then they gave us extra truffles Milk Bar Pie and a cookie because we had to wait Such awesome service I was so surprised by how delicious this was Milk Quake was to die for Like everything Tosi creates its different epic and delicious What a crazy fun night,positive,74,50-75,399,<500
Popular matcha place We came here during not so busy hours but took them awhile to make our drinks I got the maikos special with Ube on top I really like the red bean and the chestnut but I ate this after my lunch Didnt really finish cuz I was already so full The ube ice cream was good rich but not too sweet I wanted to try the mix of matcha and ube  but I think the lady misunderstood what I said I probably will get something smaller next time,positive,92,75-100,462,<500
This place is absolutely Amazing and the food was incredible Well def be adding this to our routine,positive,18,<50,102,<500
I loved the whole vibe of this place The street it is on is bumpin right next to the ferris wheel There is loud music outside which made the whole scene outside super cool We all got ice cream instead of the cupcakes and my strawberry shortcake ice cream was freakin amazing It had fresh strawberries and the crunch from the shortcake was too good One of my friends got the red velvet with the velvet cone It was good but I would recommend the strawberry shortcake ice cream It made me forget all of the money I lost in Vegas The lady helping us out was super nice and helpful I DEFINITELY recommend this place,positive,116,100-150,623,500-1000
I had high expectations for this little bakery stand because it has Bouchon attached to it and Ive heard great things about the restaurant However I was a little disappointed with my visit here I decided on the red velvet cupcake and a caramel macchiato For 350 the cupcake was a good deal for it was the size of a muffin Most cupcakes Ive had are for the same price but pretty dinky in size The frosting wasnt overly sweet and the red velvet was nice and moist It was a tad bit doughy though but nonetheless pretty good The coffee however is where things start going downhill Maybe I came on a bad day or maybe it was a new worker but Ive had caramel macchiato before at various coffee places and never had I had one like this For 5 I got their smallest size and when I picked up my cup I was surprised at how light my cup was compared to the other girls that ordered other Lattes and such I opened my cup and found it to be filled halfway with foam barely any coffee so I asked the barista if it was the correct order He just kept saying that thats how its suppose to be It didnt seem right but in any case I didnt make a scene about it 5 for half a cup of bitter coffee and foam is not well worth it They also have a few other things there like sandwiches and such but all were a bit pricey Expected I suppose since it is Vegas,negative,267,250-300,1368,1000-1500
Great place and the ice cream is out of this world I spent 15 for 2 servings of ice cream and cant wait to do it again,positive,27,25-50,122,<500
Everything is SO good here I love this place The fruity popcorn is definitely our number one item from here but the chocolate candies that they make are super good too Get the smores pretzel it they have it so good,positive,41,25-50,219,<500
Got two mochas They were overpriced small and tasted like warm milk I asked for a refund and the cashier got offended Go get your coffee somewhere else There are plenty of places at the Cosmopolitan,negative,36,25-50,203,<500
I dont get it The salted carmel brownie just didnt taste right and it should be something Id love given my usual preferences The sticky buns were tiny and just blah Not at all good Gave it away    The prices are also entirely outrageous,negative,47,25-50,247,<500
Nothing to get excited about Overpriced ice cream with little flavor I paid 5 Reeses Blizzard thats flavorless and tastes old Will not return nor recommend  I see the reviews are either 5 stars or 1 star Youre first or last huh,negative,43,25-50,238,<500
New experience with the ice cream stuffed donut but it was delicious I will be back,positive,16,<50,85,<500

I love this place They have such good Icecream and waffles Right now they are openly doing a to go window but there are several tables outside you can eat at instead,positive,32,25-50,169,<500
I would give this shop 5 stars based on the ice cream alone Id give it 5 more stars if I could for the ice cream donut sandwiches Id give it 100 stars for the staff The dudes that run it are always friendly  seem like they really love what they are doing There are a lot of places out there that sell good ice cream but there are so few that do it so well AND with great unpretentious customer service Love em Just absolutely love em,positive,89,75-100,450,<500
Ordered a gluten free truffle cake and other items When we got back to our hotel and opened the box they had packed the gluten free cake in the same closed box as the non gluten free items Ever heard of cross contamination When I called they apologized and then proceeded to ask if I requested it be packed separate I said no I didnt think it was necessary it should have been a given The manager then states that the cake was in the same case as the other items Nice way to justify the mistake made by her employee I guess it was my fault going there in the first place,negative,113,100-150,581,500-1000
Bathroom Yelp Golden Girls theme was adorable Cute clean and fun bathroom Great for families Full changing table with spares items if you dont have them Citrus spray for freshening when you leave The trash can is near the door so you can use your paper towel to open the door as you exit One person bathroom CoVid Procedures Only 2 patrons allowed in restaurant at a time All staff was wearing masks in the establishment Apple Pay accepted for touchless interactions 6ft distance tape outside Time for the grub The gluten sensitive smores brownie left no gluten to be desired They do a great job of making the brownie too delicious to tell there isnt gluten I wish I wouldve bought a regular one to test it against but Ill definitely be buying this again if they have it Coffee cake muffin was wonderfully soft and not too crumbly of a coffee cake the softness made it seem warm the entire time I was eating it Recommend this Just these two goodies make me want to try everything in the case Guess I better find some more yoga pants ,positive,191,150-200,1064,1000-1500
My family and I made a quick stop Staff was very friendly but the pastries were bad I spent 80 80 I got boxes of pastries I was expecting something delicious and all I got were stale and HARD lobster tails and cannolis that tasted like stale toaster strudel the raspberry cookies tasted like any other raspberry cookie Nothing tasted like it was freshly made,negative,65,50-75,370,<500
Everything LOOKED deliciousI got the strawberry shortcake The only good thing on there was the strawberries and the whip cream Cake was dry My friend got the cheesecake and he needed water to wash it down because it was dry How can cheesecake be dry My other friend got a cupcake and she also said it was dry All the cakes are the same batter Not worth the money We ended up finding a fountain to sit by since there were only 4 stools in the place,negative,87,75-100,460,<500
I finally went to Sprinkles last night and bought a cupcake at the ATM So disappointing It was totally awkward waiting in line it took way too longThe cupcake tasted like it came from a Betty Crocker cake mix I expected way more for 450 It wasnt even very cute The Cupcakery in Henderson has them beaten by a mile go there if you want a spectacular cupcake The ATM idea is cute but I will never go back,negative,79,75-100,420,<500
Beignets were chewy with too sweet a cherry filling that overpowered the dough The danish fruit pastry was crispy and flaky but there was a noticeable lack of fruit I ordered a Dry Cappucino and it came out like a latte I was so excited to try Bouchon but became disappointed The staff was friendly and very helpful,negative,58,50-75,321,<500
This place was HORRIBLE We got the crumb cake cheesecake and nut bar thing The nut bar thing almost broke my teeth The crumb cake was SO DRY and so BLAND The cheesecake was nothing special Cheesecake Factory is 20 times better Too pricey for NOT good quality DO NOT GO HERE Bouchon Bakery is THE BEST bakery in Vegas right now Carlos was the worst disappointment for this local,negative,70,50-75,390,<500
Caffe Bene has a lot of drinks that I would love to try but it is so overpriced The inside of the place is amazing They have a clean and cool atmosphere This is a great place to meet international students If you want coffee go somewhere else I did try their mango smoothie and loved it,negative,57,50-75,292,<500
Ive been a fan of Christina TosiMomofukuMilk Bar for a while I finally got to try it all since Im here in Vegas and its everything I pretty much expected milk bar to be I ordered the greatest hits compost cookie crack pie birthday truffles and cereal milk The cereal milk was okay It didnt really blow my mind Was kind of hoping the ice cream would be more creamier Birthday truffles were probably my favorite just moist birthday cake sprinkled with white chocolate It was so creamy and addicting and the crack pie was amazing Its one of a kind for sure Still havent tried the compost cookie but so far Im excited The staff was extremely informative kind and sweet Im definitely a true fan,positive,127,100-150,721,500-1000
I wanted to try out this place as it looks great Yup it LOOKS great but it is not that great Nice variety of items You take a plateau and pick out what you would like to buy Then wait in line Seven people working of what I see yet the wait is pretty long and the line moves slow I got 2 pastries that I heated up in the oven They were very bland mushroom one and the hot dog one Theres better spots Id say,negative,87,75-100,421,<500
Stop by here around 5pm there was a long line approximately 25 persons at the front of us no sure why the line was so long I decided go to check out what they have when my friends waited in the line I noticed the lobster croissant with cream inside cheese cakeetc If you keep eyes in your calories taken during day you should NOT come here Also their cakes arent cheap End up I didnt buy any because the cakes arent healthy making and too much fat,negative,88,75-100,464,<500
The owner helped us and he was so nice and helpful awesome guy The ice cream flavors are delicious and super creative and he lets you try as many as you want I had the almond macaron and it was awesome Loved the peanut butter ice cream too Fun little spot with friendly help,positive,54,50-75,280,<500
Let me tell you right now you wont find a better donut in life that here at the Donut Bar So many donuts to chose from and some very special options My favorite crazy donut Ive tried so far is the grilled cheese one Its absolutely perfect Get in early to avoid a line Ill be back over and over again,positive,61,50-75,310,<500
The coffee is very good and an alternative to my usual Starbucks morning coffee run but the pastries and cakes were disapointing to say the least For first thing in the morning you would expect fresh and crisp but they were soft and stale The atmosphere of the new downtown location was very nice though and it would be a great place for a meeting over coffee Hope they get the bakery side running properly soon or they will find it difficult to stick around Willing to give their breakfast and lunch food a try So stay tuned,negative,98,75-100,534,500-1000
Very slow customer service The lady wasnt the most pleasant person With the line  you can tell such a high demand however very slow in getting crepe You ll need 4550 min to get your crepe,negative,37,25-50,193,<500
Not only does Amelies have yummy food and desserts but the atmosphere is absolutely amazing It has become my ultimate workhang out space and I always feel inspired when Im there As far as the delicious sweets go they have a little of everything for varying palettes Something light and airy or something sweet and heavy Regardless itll leave your mouth watering If youre looking for something more savory the roast beef on croissant is TO DIE FOR and their soups are excellent especially the french onion This is most definitely a place to hit up as much as possible even if just grabbing a drink I love the orange cream soda and sticking your nose into your laptop,positive,119,100-150,687,500-1000
Fantastic ice cream interesting flavors  too many Hard to choose Extremely friendly staff who really took time with us Wish there was one in Dallas,positive,26,25-50,153,<500

More like so yummy so yummy SomiSomi is a growing chain of dessertcentric locations that just opened this 2nd outpost in the Las Vegas area This one is located toward the middle of Sansone Park Place on the east side of Eastern near Richmar If memory serves it used to be a Rolled Ice Cream which I predicted was due to fail because they just plain sucked Fortunately SomiSomi does not suck If they offered just one of either the soft serve or the taiyaki I would already be happy with them Those who knowstalk me may be aware that Im on a perpetual rant about how this hot desert doesnt seem to sustain dessert places in particular ice cream  gelato The milk tea  thai tea soft serve swirl combinations will rotate according to the menu was delightful though with plenty of flavor and creaminess Free toppings can go a long way too especially the crispy coconut flakes The matcha powder was also nice but be careful because wind or jostling may result in your clothing or car turning green Just as enjoyable was their custardfilled taiyaki which I ended up trying twice due to their free taiyaki w purchase grand opening promo For their ahboong 595 they serve a rounder hollow fish due to COVID policy they merely invert this onto a cup of conical ice cream instead of filling the fish itself To be clear the taiyaki is a star because its pretty much a funshaped waffle and you can even watch them cook these waffles on their proprietary waffle iron Crispy exterior and delightfully chewy interior yes Im sure Ive used that exact phrasing before but it fits are what youll find with the taiyaki as well as a sweet creamy filling of your choice Local dessert lovers or people whove known me will also recall that the Waffle Love food truck was amazing until it was kidnapped and gutted then subsequently retired Fortunately we now we have a waffle that while not in the same style is also awesome in its own way I was silly silly to pass up on SomiSomi when I was near their location on Spring Mountain in Shanghai Plaza but Ill be sure to avoid making that mistake in the future Whether youre in Nevada or another state these guys are worth going out of your way to try,positive,400,300- 500,2240,2000+
We ordered the greatest hits which was perfect it came with a compost cookie 3 pack birthday truffles a crack pie slice and the cereal milk soft serve with cornflake crunch We also ordered a chocolate birthday truffle shake not pictured because we drank that so quick because it was SO good Along with being really good omg the soft serve defiantly tasted like cereal milk lol And is it bad to say that were addicted to the crack pie,positive,80,75-100,440,<500
First time there I made a pick up order through yelp and they notified me when it was ready I walked over and their business was very comfortable All the guidelines were being followed to a T Absolutely lovely little place I ordered off the vegan menu and I will say I was not disappointed I would definitely return Wonderful service safe and sanitary environment The donuts were dope,positive,69,50-75,395,<500
I watch the show I liked the show I thought his commitment to excellence was admirable and I so wanted to try his deserts FAIL This is all media hype and the deserts were bland sub par and very expensive The wait is a min of thirty minutes and the staff were all smug and seemed to be in a bad mood I am Italian American my maternal grandfather came straight from Italy to New York and was a baker That being said I grew up with these pastries and I know how they should taste and believe me this is just CRAP I distinctly remember an episode of the Next Great Baker when Buddy was pissed at the fact that the cup cakes were not filled to capacity The Famous red velvet cupcake I had at Carlos was filled less then 34 of the way to the top of the paper there was a tiny amount of frosting set all the way to one side and it looked like something your kid sister made in Jr High and as far as taste goes is was horribly dry and almost frozen Ive had red velvet cupcakes from Ralphs grocery store that were moist and tastier,negative,205,200-250,1043,1000-1500
If youre expecting something amazing please dont go prices are steep and the quality just isnt there My wife wanted to try it since shes a fan of cake boss and we where both extremely disappointed,negative,36,25-50,201,<500
The worst milkshake Ive ever had I took a single sip and that was enough Too much milk and not enough ice cream resulted in a really watery consistency The shake was so thin that after 5 minutes of sitting the blended cookie pieces all floated up to the top The flavor is okay to mediocre but I wanted a milkshake and not a milkslush,negative,65,50-75,343,<500
It was very delicious if its your first time definitely get the cookie cup because the marshmallow goes very well with the macaron the flavors I would suggest is the captain crunch and fruity pebbles Those two flavors were delicious and true to their names So if you dont like those cereals you can avoid those flavor too,positive,58,50-75,328,<500
Had some time to burn so decided to stop by for an ice cream since I have been wanting to to try this place Overall I loved it My husband got the blueberry cheesecake in a pretzel cone and the ice cream was divine I was told that the butter pecan is the best butter pecan ever by the people who worked there and unfortunately it fell a little short It was over churned and the pecans were a bit over roasted and bitter The reason I am still giving this place 5 stars is because the pretzel cone is one of the best things I have ever tasted with ice cream I wish I would have got a different ice cream but it doesnt matter Anything in that cone would be amazing And I absolutely loved the blueberry cheesecake ice cream ,positive,143,100-150,731,500-1000

Are you kidding me I got the chocolate bacon donut bar and the Nutella Overload Its too bad I didnt eat them right when I bought them so as to have identified the MAJOR problem early on and confronted the shop about it but I saved the donuts for a late afternoon treatyoself after some hours of blackjack This is how it went down I take a few bites of the chocolate baconits aight your typical donut definitely has its work cut out for itself to catch up to the maple bacon bar of Voodoo Donuts in Portland OR Next up I take a big bite of the Nutella Overload expecting a blobby sludgy Nutella infusion Ummm NO Its a plain dry donut Baffled I take another large bite NOTHING I frantically rip apart this stupid donut and THERE IS NO NUTELLA WHATSOEVER IN THE DONUT let alone an OVERLOAD There is not even a swipe dab drop lick or smidgeon to be seen of the signature brown chocolate hazelnut heaven paste anywhere inside of the donut Nada nien niet RIEN If the Nutella Overload cost 1 then Id shrug it off But 4 paired with deceptive advertising of overload is appalling Also their hours are arbitrary and thus suck Just make more donuts Youre a selfproclaimed donut bar Lastly its tiny on the inside and located on a nondescript street Hardly a place that meets the expectations created by way of their largerthanlife website Go to Voodoo Donuts in Portland OR or Psycho Donuts in San Jose CA,negative,259,250-300,1465,1000-1500
This is your classic ice cream shop and one of the best in the Burgh Even though it is only soft serve all homemade with plenty of flavors dont let that stop you from visiting The menu is extensive with every kind of sundae and Arctic swirl combo you could imagine The cookie crumb arctic swirl with Nancy Bs chocolate chip cookies is one of my favorites Also their fall menu with pumpkin ice cream is amazing I highly recommend the pumpkin roll arctic swirl topped with a homemade pumpkin roll The parking here is a bit tricky gravel lot under a bridge and no seating outdoor counter only but absolutely worth the stop and wait can be long lines on the weekends,positive,123,100-150,679,500-1000
This place is absolutely overrated and as long as I have lived in Charlotte I have given it try after try It always manages to be over priced and disappointing There is nothing more annoying than a pastry that taste worse than it looks This is nothing like a real French bakery and isnt worth the time I recommend Renaissance Bakery for anyone looking to get good French baked goods in the Charlotte area NOT AmÃlies,negative,76,75-100,425,<500
Overhyped and not great Order an milk ice cream for 7 The ice cream ran just taste like funky,negative,19,<50,98,<500

My first time here since they took over from the old O face I have to say I am very impressed When first walking in the environment is hip The smell is so amazing and could be smelled from a block away We decided to order a dozen to make sure we all got try everything we wanted We ordered almost every kind or at least the kinds that we wanted to My favorite is the French toast so amazing and super fresh They make it right when you order it That could be breakfast alone Price point was not bad for the size of the donuts you get The staff was friendly and the chefs talked to us as we checked out Check in on Yelp for your free expresso What a wake up call We will be back soon enough,positive,142,100-150,709,500-1000
I am a big fan of Candace Nelson of Cupcake Wars So when I heard this place was opened I made a beeline for Sprinkles The store was very nice  clean They have this awesome Cupcake ATM on the outside My daughter got the Vanilla on Vanilla and I got the Red Velvet The cake was moist but thats where it ends The red Velvet didnt have any taste whatsoeverNONEZEROThe icing was like a hard fondant Not good My 13 yr old daughter loved her vanilla I tasted it after the cashier hyped it up so much Once again nothing special I honestly prefer Nothing Bundt Cakes Big Let Down Try it  see if you like it but if not venture down to CupKates at Container Park they are worth the visit,negative,134,100-150,708,500-1000
After the Yelp Hash House event all my Yelp friends wanted to check out Sprinkles for dessert Im not really a sweets person but I knew Joel would want something Its kinda confusing because they have a separate line for cupcakes and separate line for ice cream Both lines can merge if its busy and its hard to tell whos in what line They also only have certain flavors on certain days when it comes to their ice cream Since it was super hot out we picked a small scoop of Triple Chocolate It set me back about 4 The taste of it wasnt that great For that kind of money Id rather have gone to Yogurtland They do have a cupcake ATM that is a cool feature The staff was friendly and its not their fault they are gouging people for subpar ice cream Do yourself a favor and skip this place and save the money I sure wish I had,negative,162,150-200,842,500-1000
These are hands down the best oldfashioned donuts anywhere in Cleveland In fact we were in Beckers donuts out in Avon this morning and the woman working there said I was in Cleveland the other day and went into Jack Frost They have the best donuts anywhere After a pregnant pause she said except us of course We all know what she really meant Cash only boys and girls although the prices are still ridiculously low,positive,76,75-100,437,<500
Stingy cashier they got a bad attitude I ordered 20 pieces of bread and they shoved it in one small box and it all got crushed If u want to go to 85 degrees I suggest going to a different location The bread is only decent and it even worse that these poorly trained workers crush them into a box,negative,60,50-75,300,<500
Im soooo sad I wanted to like this place so much We ordered the soft serve with cereal It was okay didnt really have taste and was slightly salty for some reason I personally enjoyed the sweet bites i did get but my boyfriend didnt We also got the crack pie i was so disappointed I dont think its something to be eaten cold it was hard to chew the flavor wasnt anything extremely special it just was not what i expected at all,negative,84,75-100,446,<500
Best donuts in Vegas The donuts are balanced with good dough sweet and flavor They are not greasy The staff is very friendly We are regulars here tried everything and find them all enjoyable The grilled cheese donut w Sriracha is phenomenal I also love the lemon pistachio and Samoa when available The menu rotates weekly and a few constants Get here early they close when they sell out Their espresso drinks are great too Joe the owner is a great guy I appreciate his craftsmanship and commitment to downtown Vegas,positive,91,75-100,534,500-1000
Holy heaven From the moment we walked in I was blown away They insisted on a sample of every flavor to help me find my frozen soul mate and then scooped me the best butter pecan ice cream side of the Mississippi plopped it into a specially made warm glazed donut bun and topped it with Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal We didnt stop there though A fresh pressed waffle sandwiched my honey lavender ice cream with fruity pebbles on top Over the top Absolutely Worth every delicious bite You betcha,positive,90,75-100,509,500-1000

MILK is good BUT sometimes its hard to justify the prices of the items Cornflake Chocolate Chip Marshmallow Cookie 45 My favorite cookie they offer Too bad only the name is a mouth full Their cookies are too small for the price IMO But this one is yummy with a good balance of salty cornflake and sweet everything else Compost cookie 25 Im not a fan of pretzels or potato chips in my cookies so its a hard pass for me But it also has a hodgepodge of other ingredients such as chocolate chips toffee chips graham crackers and rolled oats I usually purchase 622  which equals out to about 370 per cookie Birthday Cake truffles 35 Super duper sweet and prices at about 7 for a pack of three or four cant remember Crack pie 35 Also super sweet and priced at about 7 for a slice,negative,149,100-150,812,500-1000

I have a love for cakes cookies pastries and most of all donuts Especially on vacation Because when you are on vacation everyone knows that all the rules of physics go out the door and any calories you consume are offset by all the walking you do truth My first order of business in Las Vegas was to find some delicious donuts other than the Krispy Kreme and Dunkin Donuts variety Located in downtown Vegas I found Donut Bar At the time I didnt know Donut Bar original shop in San Diego was listed as the Number 1 Donut Shop on lists from USA Today a hrefredirurlhttp3A2F2FThrillistcoms2318db7cc9d2a933066949f28dc05a7139148ba530a91c0fa15454d6d09279f9 target_blank relnofollowThrillistcoma MSN and more But as soon as I walked in I knew I had found a gem The donuts they offer are huge over the top and look downright amazing Their most popular is their Big Poppa Tart Donut which is made with a full pop tart and weighs one entire pound I wanted to try everything but I decided on three crÃme brulee blueberry with meyer lemon and maple bacon The crÃme brulee is a yeast donut filled with crÃme topped with a hard candy shell For those with a sweet tooth you will love biting into it For those that like their donuts a little less sweet the blueberry with meyer lemon is perfect The cake donut is topped with a perfectly lemony frosting My favorite was the maple bacon bar The yeast donut is so soft and topped generously with thick and chewy bacon pieces that paired with the sweet maple frosting like a dream Mmmmmm Its a bit of a gamble as they close when they sell out but if you visit Donut Bar after 10am they serve donut ice cream cones I will get one of those one day,positive,303,300- 500,1750,1500-2000
Mitchells is worth the calories I hadnt been to this particular location before so I was surprised by how huge it is I got the tasters duo with the caramel apple and amaretti cookie flavors Both were excellent and had great texture My fiance got one of the sundaes and he was happy with his also Ive never been disappointed by anything Ive gotten at Mitchells and Ill definitely be back,positive,71,50-75,402,<500
I probably would have given a 3 star but my 2 visits left a bitter aftertaste On my first visit it was really packed So I couldnt ask about pricing or how ordering worked My sister and I thought the ice cream was good but really heavy and sweet The service was fast but not really friendly since it felt like they were in training mode and I felt really rushed The cashier making my order also forgot I ordered a second ice cream So I had to remind her On top of that I kept getting weird looks that I couldnt decipher maybe annoyed Plus she also forgot my extra topping which is 50 cents extra I had to remind her yet again It was a really meager amount too She also got chocolate drizzle all over the sides of the cup but she kind of quickly wiped it down when she was instructed to But I still got chocolate all over my hands The ice cream was also really expensive for how small the portion size was I paid about 16 for the two ice creams and the extra topping on both So it ended up being around 6ish for each I had no idea what the pricing would be until after I ordered because the price wasnt listed for the signature items on their wall menu The cashier also didnt give me a receipt until I asked so I had no idea what I paid since I missed what the total was due to the choatic environment On a side note when paying you swipe for debit and insert chip for credit The cashier didnt explain this So my card wouldnt go through when I chose debit and inserted my card She didnt bother explaining why my card wouldnt go through So I just ended up guessing and tried swiping My card finally went through They really need to take the time to communicate no matter how busy it is It left a bad impression I decided to give it another try the next day since I was in the area I didnt know what time they opened so I ended up coming too early and waited close to 30 minutes When I entered I heard the cashier kind of groan or make some sound similiar to a groan I felt unwelcomed but I ignored it since I waited 30 minutes since my sister really wanted a drink I ended up getting two drinks the Matcha Coffee and the Strawberry Matcha Latte The cashier for this second visit also did not tell me about the payment process She chose credit for me and I inserted my card since I remembered the other day that I chose debit and needed to swipe This was annoying because if I had a card without a chip and I tried swiping after she chose credit for me my card wouldnt have gone through Anyway the coffee drink for the price definitely wasnt worth it They add plain cane sugar for the coffee For the price I was hoping for honey or a higher quality sweetener But the strawberry latte was good It just needed more strawberry syrup Although how they make the drinks seem inconsistent I was watching the drink making process and the cashier was using two different brands of almond milk because it must have ran out Anyway my sister noticed that her almond milk was low quality and tasted bad before she mixed her latte I didnt even tell her that it was low quality milk until after she told me her observation They used Great Value almond milk in her drink while they used Simple Truth in mine For the price they should use a good brand of milk substitute The cheap stuff tends to taste bad She liked the matcha though She thought it might have been a high quality matcha I have to agree on that I ended up googling them since I was curious about the reviews because my overall experience was pretty bad When browsing the pictures I noticed that our ice cream was definitely much smaller and it was more of a heavy concrete texture compared to the light swirls in the pictures I took the ice creams togo So I guess they cut the size down to get the lid on They should have told me I would get more than 50 less ice cream if I got a lid They need to get bigger lids or something Although what angered me was that in the pictures the Cookies and Cream ice cream had Cocoa Puffs and Cookie Crisps However my ice cream definitely did not have any of those toppings When I ate it the day before I just assumed they blended it into my ice cream Lastly the Minions Treat was either missing the almonds or it was such a skimpy amount that I couldnt see it or taste it The ice creams in the pictures had a decent amount of toppings for the exact ice creams we got I dont know why we barely had any toppings and some of our toppings were missing We are lactose intolerant This was supposed to be a rare treat worth the stomach pains and other problems The only nice thing about the experience was that the ownermanagertrainer or whatever her position is seemed nice She told the girl making my order to wipe the chocolate drizzle off the sides of my cup because she was about to hand it to me without wiping it She also got me a togo menu when I asked for one,negative,945,500+,4961,2000+
Oh Sloans Your adorable stuffed creatures and fun decor were enticing enough to reel me in but your ice cream though yummy is incredibly overpriced A regular 2scoop cup as pictured contains the smallest scoops known to man and cost me nearly 9 This left me feeling not only disappointed but still hungry If I ever stop by again itll be to hug a giant Squishable Even if Sloans had the most uniquely mesmerizing flavor selection Id ever encountered I just wouldnt be able to justify paying this much for such small serving sizes The other sweets on display seem like they may be more worthwhile but Im unsure of the pricing on those for all I know its 20donut However if youre looking for humorous kitchen decor or soft toys for the tiny humans in your life there might be some value in stopping by after all The choice is yours but be sure to proceed with caution,negative,159,150-200,900,500-1000
Fatty Daddy use to be amazing but the original owners sold around November and everything is on a very bad spiral downwards The new owner Lana Zhou continually has bounced employee checks and then its a fight for the employees to get their money Most recently employees had to explain to her the new minimum wage laws and she since said she would pay them the appropriate rate but take away their tips As youll notice tip jars are still out and its requested when you pay with card FYI thats not going to the employees She will degrade her employees in front of customers to the point where customers will yell at her stand up for employees and vow to never return Its a shame such a great neighborhood ice cream place with so much potential is now on the road to closure because of mismanaged funds and poor management If you support local business this is not the one,negative,161,150-200,889,500-1000
Bummer We love their ice cream probably our favorite in the area but we were horrified at the blatant disregard for healthy and safe standards during Covid19 Less than half of the customers in line had masks on and no one stayed 6 apart People were sticking their unmasked faces into the opening to shout their orders so I fear for the employees We will stay away until things clear up or management insists on masks and social distancing,negative,79,75-100,450,<500

If youre in the area you have to stop by this ice cream shop Even if you have to go a little out of the way its worth stopping by Its seriously good Ive tried the salty caramel It tastes salty but then you are hit with the sweet caramel  the 2 melded together is heavenly The flavors are very prominent and you can actually taste the caramel Ive also tried the brown butter almond It tastes just as it sounds Id have difficulty choosing between the two but luckily you can choose 2 flavors The staff said they stopped giving samples to try but if you dont like the flavor you can let them know and they can exchange it for you,positive,124,100-150,648,500-1000
First time I came here it was amazing 5 stars this time they ruined my sons ice cream by scratching there hair over his open cup of ice cream they then handed both my sons ice cream and my gingerbread pudding with ice cream full of sprinkles and hard balls and hard candies that I did not ask for I hate sprinkles and I do mean hate like they make me vomit so when I see this I ask the girl who took my order and she said its only on top so I figure hey I can scrape it off I waited 20 mins and I know its going to be good I start eating after I threw half ice cream away with sprinkles just to find out the stupid mess was all the way three and she lied about it Will not be back,negative,146,100-150,685,500-1000

After lunch I got that sweet craving for ice cream and decided to venture to sweet republic Walked in and the you g girl behind the counter must have been the most miserable person When they offer so many flavors you have to be able to taste some to decide She made me feel like I was being a bother and I felt pressured and uncomfortable to ask to try more flavors Other guests walked in and we decided this would be our opportunity to leave as the ice cream store should be a happy place to visit We went to Scoop n Joy and had a fabulous time sampling so many flavors,negative,113,100-150,576,500-1000

What a magical treat this place is I have had Somi Somi bookmarked for quite a while Just a couple of locations and all far from where I live I met a friend to try a new pizza place and Somi Somi was only two doors down so we stopped for dessert So easy to find right off of Eastern Avenue Somi Somi is a special Korean dessert that is known is Ah Boong First you decide how you wish to eat your Somi Somi I chose upside down Ah Boong It is served in a fish shape waffle cone Next you select a soft serve flavor I chose Matcha Then you choose a filling I decided on Taro Lastly you may also select a topping of cereal bites coconut strawberry etc I have been back several times now and almost always order my dessert now with Ube soft serve Nutella filling and a different topping each time This is one of the most refreshing and tasty desserts I had all summer Their soft serve is so creamy and packs plenty of flavor The homemade waffle cone is soft and flavorful especially with Nutella Warning the servings are large so you can probably share one with whomever you are with I look forward to returning again and again I am pretty sure that I will be eating this delightful dessert in the winter too Why not,positive,236,200-250,1236,1000-1500
Amelies in NoDa is The OG or as I like to put it My 3rd Shift Savior back in the day when I rolled at night Where else are you going to go to get a chocolate croissant at 230 in the morning Wait why do you want a croissant at that hour None of my business its yours if youre in NoDa Located at the corner of 28th and N Davidson Amelies is everything youve ever wanted in a corner side cafe They make premium coffee tea and desserts as well as many lunch offerings My hands down favorite for lunch is the Chicken Salad croissant chunky texture very little filler just for binding buttery flaky pastry excuse me for a moment I need to take a drive back there now How about sweets Mixed berry Macaron is a crowdpleaser Be sure to ask the counter staff about all of the macarons on display The Salted Caramel Layered Torte is great as long as I didnt have something too filling to eat before because this thing is as rich as it comes If youre familiar with the Salted Caramel Brownie add laters of mousse in between with more chocolate WOW Mad respect where it is due with this being the original location but Im a much more frequent patron of the uptown location Not due to proximity because Im much much closer to the NoDa site but because of the typical crowdedness of the place Forget about sitting anywhere near the service counter unless you want to be brushed up against by dozens of people you dont know Even the back is iffy sometimes if theyre really busy as the line can easily back up 5060 deep Theyre doing the best they can trust me its just a really busy spot Dont even think about going here after a N Charlotte event or a NBA game youre doomed When it comes to crowd control theyre a victim of their tremendous success Yes logic would have you believe that the Uptown location would be busier but its almost always the exact opposite Still sometimes Ill pick a time I know it wont be too bad think very very early on a weekday like 5am just to enjoy the ambiance this location offers knowing that Im sitting in the middle of Charlotte history and wondering where theyll pop up next please be University Mallard Creek even better To all the people who thought a 247 bakery in the middle of NoDa would close down within 3 months look at them now Break bread with your neighbors and join in the pride of watching this great QC brand continue to grow and wow you with enticing treats,positive,455,300- 500,2488,2000+
Ive always stock up at Buchon Bakery when Im in Vegas The most recent Vegas visit we actually stayed at The Venetian so it was perfect to grab some goodies to go as we checkout This location is right by the guest elevators on ground floor Since I dont get to visit Vegas often I always get the same Kouign Amann macaron and almond croissant This time I also got a ham  cheese croissant for the hubby for the road but I also instantly regret not getting more French macaron I guess you live and learn hahaha Husband was oohing and ahhing while eating the ham and cheese croissant which I requested to be heated up He said the egg was soft and the crossiant nice and flaky it was simply delicious The macaron was soft and creamy and Im sad I had to share it with him Honestly I think their macaron its even better than when I had it in LaDuree in France Theres not a bad pastry here and I also had a really nice hot latte Although I want to mentioned that this last visit there was only one line to order on the side And when I had to come around to see what breakfast sandwich they had the worker totally gave me a look and rolled her eyes because I was taking a bit too long Hence the one star knocked off,positive,239,200-250,1234,1000-1500

Disclaimer I want to try this place at the right time and redo this review Came in on a Saturday night and there were literally only 6 flavors in the ice cream freezer all of which were near empty and a lot of other products were sold out My friends sucked it up and got a Peanut Butter  Jealous shake mixed with other flavors I cant remember and the other got two HEAPING scoops of a berry ice cream for himself I must say they looked good So 1 measly star for having so much outofstock but I will visit again and I will have ice cream Hopefully,negative,109,100-150,561,500-1000

When you first walk in you feel aweinspired The decor is crazy cool and very unique definitely a different setting than Starbucks The place is always busy even at 1 am The line does tend to move at a pretty steady rate but if youre impatient its better to check out the local Harris Teeter Ive only been twice so please do read with a grain of salt Ive only had macaroons twice both times here as a new experience and both times they were pretty good from what I could tell although Im not much of a food critic and the small mousse cups are a delicious little bite I would like to see more variety when it comes to macaroons though Ive seen so many flavors online My biggest complaint would have to be the staff they all seem a bit unpleasant The cashiers seem to be less than enthusiastic to be ringing customers up At my last visit a woman behind the counter was helping those waiting in line to get their boxes prepared for the register and after serving us in a mundane manner she quietly asked the folks behind us for their order Being that it was so busy and it was a small group of friends chatting they more than likely didnt here her but she mumbled something under her breath and turned away from them I dont know what she said but Im pretty sure it wasnt very kind I get it it must be exhausting but you have to be aware of the fact that you are working an exhausting job at least TRY to act like youre happy to take 13 for a few pastries,positive,284,250-300,1495,1000-1500

A fun place for a sweet treat on the Strip The place has a very cute vibe and is quite tiny squeezed into a small storefront next to Momofuku in the Cosmo Staff is friendly and takes orders quickly If nothing else the flavors at Milk Bar are out of the box There were lots of items I wanted to try but I was most intrigued by the cereal milk soft serve and the crack pie The cereal milk soft serve really does taste like sugarinfused milk with a starchiness thats quite unique My slice of crack pie was gooey and very delicious Neither item was overly sweet Prices are high  probably too high for the portion size But maybe I shouldnt complain since portion sizes are obscenely huge elsewhere Id be interested in coming back to try the cookies and klossies,positive,143,100-150,777,500-1000

I was initially excited to come here after looking at all the wonderful reviews I ordered the cookie cup being over seven dollars thinking it would all be worth the money I tasted a few flavors and decided to stick with chocolate but the flavor or consistency was nothing special Overall the scoop was rather small considering the price The macaroon and toasted marshmallow on top were the only significant parts but Ive seen many other places where you can get much more for a price like that,negative,88,75-100,504,500-1000

My sisters wanted to try this place out because we are all fans of Cake Boss and Buddy and his family They tell you the line is about 20 minutes ummm you mean over an hour I was able to go all the way to Wynn buy something and the LV store and come back when my sisters where just hitting the counter Good for me bad for them You order then you have to wait to pay They will call you over to confirm your order once they box it up Too bad I didnt notice that two of the rugelach cookies were burntas in you should have dumped these cookies in the trash can rather than putting it out to sell  especially  1299 lb I felt RIPPED OFF They were running out of Lobster tails  and the person behind us was asked when they were confirming her order if she would mind having two lobster tails removed from her order  I think they oversold  theres a lag between taking customers orders and filling them which can create issues like this Skip Carlos and go to another bakery if you are in this area  Hello you are in Vegas and theres LOTS of other places to try Thankfully and Buddy I watch your show Buddys Bakery Rescue and you might want to go to this location and rescue it Im just sayin,negative,239,200-250,1232,1000-1500
I wanted to make custom cakes from them but they have a HORRIBLE response time in replying to Email orders I called and asked to make several custom cakes for friends of mine and they mentioned to email the request I sent out an email request and received one reply out of the 4 emails I sent The response time to that one email was a week later Expect long waits throughout the day with a shortage of staff Workers are all still in training mode and incapable of dealing with large volume orders and dealing with crowds Wait a few more weeks before going here and hopefully theyll get their operation in order Current management is poor and dont bother emailing them Cake requests PreMade cakes on the other hand turned out well I picked up 2 of them for a friends birthday and all thought the cake was delicious one Star for that,negative,155,150-200,849,500-1000
My two stars are for the decor and ambiance which are both quite cool There is an assortment of pastries behind the glass and decided to try a few Major disappointment Pastries seemed stale with no flavor and the prices werent cheap I did enjoy the artistic and unique touches around the place and think it would do much better as a gift shop instead of bakery,negative,67,50-75,367,<500
I wish they had these in every town like McDonalds is Amelies is the bees knees I get a Napoleon every time I come in And its filled with French items such as paintings and other art work I never eat in because theyre always busy and it gets really noisy Staff has always treated me well and very knowledgeable about their products Recommend to anyone who hasnt had it,positive,70,50-75,377,<500
Wow This is no ordinary donut shop omg I walked in and I could not decide what to get I want them all I had the vanilla bean donut which by the way are gigantic and the creme brÃlÃe donut ohhh so yummy a must try,positive,46,25-50,222,<500
I dont understand what the attraction is Its definitely cute but my cappuccino was cold and the cake was dense and not very good My husband had chocolate cream pie that was literally pie crust with a very thin layer of chocolate Not good,negative,44,25-50,243,<500
I dont mind this place but be prepared to wait in line For a one scoop cone on a cake cone is right around 6 bucks 6 bucks for a one scoop of ice cream is really starting to push it Regarding the ice cream its very good They let you sample which is nice They have funky flavors but most are very tasty I had the FrosÃ on a cake cone and wow it was like drinking frozen wine Very very good Cone was stale however not that great They do make their own ice cream cones which I appreciate they are made right in front of you I would suggest going for that over the cake cones I tried the darkest chocolate too which I loved I would give this a try again and sample some more flavors Its a cute store but very crowded right now,positive,149,100-150,745,500-1000
Soooo amazing I got the caramel fudge brownie It was significantly better than I was imagining,positive,16,<50,102,<500
I was so excited to finally try this place out They dont have one where we live so when my husband and I were in Vegas for a weekend we figured why not Unfortunately the experience left much to be desired The compost cookie was far too salty and the bday shake tasted like nothing but straight up sugar I love sweets as much as the next person but too much sugar is a very real thing This in itself caused them to miss the mark on what could of been some really yummy treats Also the price I get that were in Vegas and everything is overpriced but Im a strong believer in getting what you pay for and that was not the case here The idea is cute but just not well executed I honestly cant recommend it,negative,140,100-150,717,500-1000
Good selection of sandwiches The ice cream looked great but I didnt try it Husband and I both had the BLT which was good Nice crisp bacon on some kind of toasted egg bread All very reasonable priced The only reason for the two stars is that we both had some tummy issues about an hour or so later and that was the last thing we ate If it wasnt for that I would give another star I could be encouraged to give this place another go though and hope that its a one off just because the food tasted so good,negative,102,100-150,513,500-1000
This is probably my favorite breakfast location in town Highly suggest the build your own breakfast sandwich you cant go wrong with either the croissant or baguette but I prefer the baguette if forced to chose Also the pastrys and desserts in the case are always fresh and very tasty I have yet to find one I didnt enjoy but the tea cakes are my favorite There is a huge selection of macaroon flavors to chose from and an almost supply at any time of day Cant go wrong morning afternoon or night with a visit here,positive,97,75-100,524,500-1000
After all the hype of watching Cake Boss which I know is a different location we were expecting a lot more from Carlos Bake Shop in the Venetian The look is authentic and the glass kitchen a nice touch but the items we tried were just ok The Peanut Butter  Jelly cookies could be made better in the average kitchen certainly my homemade cookies beat these hands down The best thing we had was the vanilla slice like a mille feuille cant remember what they called it the pastry cream was good and the puff pastry thin and well defined Too many option in Vegas for this to be more than a novelty stop,negative,115,100-150,612,500-1000
Only two stars because the fact is that yes I have experienced better than the pastries at the Las Vegas Bouchon Bakery The best of what I sampled was the chocolate croissant it had two ribbons of chocolate in it which was quite nice However the pastry was just a bit too tough when it should have been tender and it was too greasy I also took tastes of four different macaron flavors chocolate vanilla raspberry and lemon The chocolate was far and away the best of the four but it was more like a brownie than a macaron The weakest were the raspberry and lemon which had too much oozy filling Worst of what I tried the pain au raisin Pain au raisin is supposed to be a custard raisin roll not a raisin danish Flat extremely greasy I will only grudgingly acknowledge that there were enough raisins and that they were soft and tender but that couldnt salvage the thing I dont know maybe Im holding this place to unfairly high standards but I know that pastry can be better,negative,182,150-200,1004,1000-1500
Sugar overload Just had a glazed donut it was delicious soft yet satisfyingly doughy at the same time with a nice amount of glaze As a first timer it was a bit overwhelming to have to keep asking what each donut was but hang in there and order what looks good for your dozen to take home They have serve yourself togo coffee and assorted bottled beverages Cash only although their sign states they will accept a check with proper ID,positive,81,75-100,445,<500
Seriously People in AZ must be hard up for good ice cream Just because they put unique combinations together doesnt mean that its good ice cream Maybe Im biased because Im from San Francisco and have been spoiled with BiRite ice cream I do know good ice cream when I eat it and sweet republic is all hype The salted caramel started out good but then just tasted like flavored whipped cream It left a rotten milk after taste in my mouth that made me keep saying ew I tried the honey blue cheese Very strong flavor but nothing special I get what they were trying to do and its a good thing theyre in Arizona because in California they wouldnt be as successful Not to mention the staff was rude We were the only ones in there on a hot Saturday afternoon which should tell you something and there were three people behind the counter but it still took a few minutes before we were acknowledged Then the lady was simply cold and annoyed Ok point taken we wont be back Not a loss Well at least not for us,negative,191,150-200,1026,1000-1500
Needless to say the ice cream is amazing The reason as to why I gave it one star primarily deals with the fact that the managementownership treat their employees in a completely unprofessional manner For example on multiple occasions I have seen employees scolded for overscooping With regards to the price the portions are not proportional to what you pay I suggest you go to Whole Foods they have the same ice cream without the lack of professionalism and skimpy portions,negative,81,75-100,490,<500
Bought my friend some birthday cupcakes from here and she loved them They also have vegan options which are also delicious,positive,21,<50,125,<500
We ordered a custom cake for a family celebration It was beautiful and tasted great The cake here is not overwhelmingly sweet like you get at a grocery store but it has intense flavors which we prefer The 8 inch cake easily served 13 with some leftovers My one recommendation is that the business set it up so that you receive an automated email confirmation when you submit an order online The shop is really nice too if you want to sit and enjoy a coffee,positive,86,75-100,464,<500
I had several items 5 items and they were only so so Most of the items were thrown away 12 finished by the people I was with Nothing we ordered was great I dont think I will be back I had several cupcakes peanut butter Much better food to be found in Vegas,negative,53,50-75,270,<500
I love this place What a cute little gem to enjoy Im a simple ice cream girl so this place is overwhelming for me but the simple flavors like cookies and cream are to die for cause they make them The ice cream sandwich with the lightly salted warm chocolate chip cookie is ridic Lemon cake was my favorite flavor so unique and fresh Come check this place out they do movie nights in the summer,positive,76,75-100,408,<500
Oh goodness where do I begin So when we arrived there was a bit of the line  I could hear the people ordering talking to the employee asking about the types of options they had but I couldnt hear all the info cause ya know social distancing so when we got to the window to order I was hesitant to ask because she might be sick of explaining the same damn thing over and over lol but noo she was so sweet and explained everything to us Eventually ended up getting the Cookie Monster dough melt and OMG After each bite of it I was getting sadder and sadder I DIDNT WANT IT TO BE OVER insert hysterically crying face the doughnut was warm and delicious as was the ice cream ugh loved it and the area was cute nice little sitting area loved everything about it ,positive,149,100-150,770,500-1000
Its a small space but great ice cream and amazing ideas They also have gifts you can buy,positive,18,<50,90,<500
Probably one of the best macarons that Ive ever tasted Huge chewy and sweet what more could you ask for I got a box of macarons 1500 for 6 pistachio chocolate salted caramel coffee I highly recommend the pistachio macarons Definitely worth it,positive,43,25-50,259,<500
Love the donuts way off the beam on calories BUT hey if ur eating a donut why care about calories I am only giving 4 stars cause they dont have their nutrition info on the donuts,positive,36,25-50,181,<500
Not at all impressed with the cookie I got The flavor was pretty bland and the dried blueberries were just odd Definitely an overhyped placed,negative,25,<50,144,<500
Ive read so much about their salted butter caramel and it was soyawntasteless I found nothing exciting about it and I will never go back I found a much much better place in Scottsdale that just opened called Cream City CafÃ and there is NO comparison Sweet Republic is not so sweet,negative,52,50-75,305,<500
Amelies is the perfect cafe to meet with friends go on a date or simply get some work done in a peaceful homey environment They offer a great selection of sweets salads sandwiches and cold and hot drinks Their coffees and lattes are very tasty I had the pumpkin clove latte and I really enjoyed it This is my go to place if I need to get out of the house to focus on work Open 247 FREE WIFI and seating in multiple areas My life saver Also the decor is so unique Whoever decorated their locations is very talented,positive,100,75-100,534,500-1000
I tried 6 different pastry items and a coffee drink and the only good thing was the coffee For the 30 I spent it was horrible the portions were small and it was a complete waste of time DO NOT go there just go to Nonas Much better,negative,48,25-50,239,<500
This is one of my cheat meal places Creamy ice cream of flavors to tempt and make you verrrrrrry happy I had a regular waffle cone with mint chip ice cream and chocolate shots or sprinkles how you folks call it out here in the west They scooped my 1st scoop then did something amazing  covered the scoop in chocolate shots  THEN scooped the next scoop on top and covered it with more chocolate shots OMG I almost hugged him when he handed me my cone of layered goodness My hubby had one of their milkshakes which is his weakness and Churn does not disappoint Many flavors  many confection combos and the best way to beat the heat and reward yourself with this creamy goodness Minimal parking but once you find a spot  its worth it Much love to Churn,positive,144,100-150,769,500-1000
I hardly ever splurge on dessert or buy cupcakes but we saved room for dessert after dinner to stop by Sprinkles We were so disappointed when both of our cupcakes were on the stale side like they had been sitting out too long I had the pumkpin one and it was sadly bland My husband had the black and white which was not much better The service was great and everyone was very friendly I just wish we would have visited when some of the cupcakes were fresh out of the oven,negative,92,75-100,480,<500
MILK BAR IN WEST COAST finally I got the fruity pebble ice cream with corn flakes and the corn flake chocolate chip marshmallow cookie The fruity pebble ice cream was a bit sweet to my taste but the corn flake had a hint of saltyness to it so it balanced out For the hype and talk that everyone had I think this place was not as amazing as everyone says It was 6 for a scoop of ice cream Its worth trying if youre a huge fan of sweets As for the cookie it was different Super chewy and like the ice cream the corn flake had a hint of saltyness which was different I would try more of their other cookies next time,positive,124,100-150,630,500-1000
Went to Somisomi in Henderson and counter asked where my mask was So I walked out I watched from the window four feet from her was a crowd of unmasked customers eating ice cream Why in the hell do I need a mask for when the rest of the restaurant is unmasked Do germs stay away from the left side of the restaurant Idiots,negative,64,50-75,327,<500

One of the best little hidden treasures in Champaign I have never had anything I didnt like here The drinks are all really good and the treats oh man the treats They always have a great variety to choose from and if you have a sweet tooth then this is the place for you The shop also has some really great little unique items whether for gifts or just yourself Ive never had a bad experience here the girls are all so sweet and helpful Anytime anyone comes to town to visit I make sure to bring them to Hopscotch for a goodie This business is just one great example of why you should support local businesses,positive,117,100-150,622,500-1000
I loved their food They know their food well The chocolate almond croissant was heavenly and so was my coffee Im definitely coming back for more Price was very reasonable for the quality of the fresh food Well done guys,positive,40,25-50,229,<500
Want to know how to make a childs dream come true Then youve come to the right place The name of the store is misleading They dont JUST sell ice cream they pretty much sell ALL the sweets you can think of candy apples cookies candies donuts and more Youll recognize this place FIRST by smelling it rather than by seeing it Youll smell the irresistible sweet bakery scent a long ways off and before you know it you have arrived at this heavenly place Once you get here you cant help but check out what this shop has got You might even be tempted to make a purchase yourself I know I was But do watch out for the prices since they are sort of expensive Ordered a candy apple and it was around 67,positive,136,100-150,724,500-1000
We got the 5 pack of cannoli and 4 pack of lobster tails variety pack each It was very delicious The price was a little steep we paid 4700 for both I can say i ate at carlos bakery and had the cannoli for 47 dollars No line we were in and out very quickly I enjoyed the experience can i find cheaper cannoli somewhere else Maybe Will it be as good as carlos  But for my first Cannoli at least i have a good starting point for what i know is a good cannoli,positive,96,75-100,467,<500
My friend brought me here while I was visiting from out of town and Im so glad she did This place is amazing The ice cream is so fresh They have so many unique flavors it was so hard to choose I loved how they have the option for half scoops so I could try more flavors It also smells so good from the fresh waffle cones,positive,67,50-75,327,<500
Trust issues man Got the Grandmas Cookies and my sample tasted like snickerdoodle and I saw it had something else in it but I wasnt sure what it was And it ended up being You guessed it oatmeal raisin The descriptions should say what they actually are My wife loved it so that was nice,negative,55,50-75,302,<500
This place has such great reviews and I really dont want to put in a bad review but my experience here was beyond horrible Bought 60 worth of bakery and everything tasted old Maybe because we came late at night Im not sure the reason why but the lines were long and I didnt mind because the atmosphere and decor there was absolutely one of a kind I wished I couldve said the same with their bakery I would update this bad review when or if I would ever go back,negative,91,75-100,473,<500
My new favorite bakerysweet treat place Everything I have tried here has been amazing The espresso is good too A little pricy but thats expected for the location and quality of the pastries,positive,33,25-50,196,<500
This place was great My husband and I split the meatball sub with chips and picked out several dessert options The place wasnt busy when we first got there so pulling a number tab wasnt necessary but within 5 minutes after ordering the place was packed They have an adequate amount of seating between the inside and outside If we end up going back we live in Louisville KY and stopped here on a road trip and order the meatball sub again I will ask for an additional cup of tomato sauce it was incredible and would be very tasty on the kettle chips served with the sub Great spot and I recommend it highly,positive,115,100-150,619,500-1000
Ive been to the Bouchon Bakery in Yountville which I give a rating of 3 and its much better than this Vegas kiosk When I went last time my cupcake was overly sweet that I could only eat a couple bites the macarons lacked a crispy shell and tasted more like whoopie pies and my cookie was a little too hard Overall the baked goods at this location do not taste very fresh Its always crowded too so the staff isnt very friendly and rushes people in line,negative,88,75-100,464,<500
If you havent been to Masons Creamery drop what youre doing and go now Best ice cream in Cleveland The employees are cool and fun Try everything,positive,27,25-50,152,<500

Ive ordered the vegan caramel popcorn at the melt the last 3 times Ive been The first time the popcorn was so chewy It got all stuck in my teeth and so hard to chew I considered maybe it was just a bad bag So I gave it another chance and ordered it a second time because the melt doesnt have any other vegan desserts and it was delicious Exactly what you would expect for caramel popcorn sweet caramel glaze crunchy Ordered it a third time and another disappointment I dont want to blame the company maybe its the way the melt stores it  but 13 not good odds I did mention this to the melt they shrugged Still not sure if its supposed to be chewy Also it was from different locations bummer,negative,134,100-150,729,500-1000
The donuts were good but there is no sitting area I little disappointed drove from San Diego to try it,negative,20,<50,104,<500
Worth all the hype I got vanilla ice cream with Fruity pebbles infused with cheese cake bites on top and i couldnt stop eating it Little bit of a drive for me from my house but it was worth it Hopefully they open a location closer 1010 would recommend going,positive,50,25-50,264,<500
This place is awesome I had a glazed twist doughnut and it was served to me warm It was like going to Krispy Kreme when the light is on but better The dough is chewy and soft and perfectly flavored I dont normally eat sweets but Id driven by and wondered about this place The indulgence was well worth it The person I visited with is not a vegan and felt just as satisfied as I was Its always nice when choosing a vegan option doesnt require a sacrifice of taste or quality Two thumbs up Vegan Doughnut Company,positive,99,75-100,528,500-1000
In summer this place is always bustling and you can tell why They have a ton of super delicious flavors but my absolute favorite is the Zanzibar chocolate Its the richest most chocolatey chocolate ice cream Ive ever had and I go out of my way to get it whenever Im in the area or in a few Milwaukee grocery stores where its sold The storefront is small and can get crowded during busy times but the service is efficient and you really cant beat the ice cream,positive,88,75-100,469,<500
Tried this place after hearing about the hype Had to wake up extra early so try all the flavors before they sold out This was not worth the hype we got a dozen doughnuts since we dont live in Vegas The special doughnuts werent anything special The creme brulee didnt have enough filling nor did the other flavors All the doughnuts tasted normal flavors werent special or wow about them compared to most normal doughnut shops Ive had better doughnuts in the east coast This was such a disappointment,negative,89,75-100,515,500-1000
Ordered a crack pie milk shake and a side expresso I was going to sip the espresso and follow it with the milkshake but laziness got the better of me so I just dumped it in there to form a super powerful flavorful milk shake Im sure the caffeine content was much higher than your standard coffee milkshake because Im wired as fuck The milk shake itself had a nice consistency to it I couldnt put my finger on what the flavor was never had crack pie before but after mixing it with the expresso I could definitely taste a buttery creaminess to it that was artery clogging satisfaction Order up,positive,111,100-150,605,500-1000
Kid in a candy shop Thats the nostalgia Sloans gave me upon walking in I forgot to count how many flavors but my oh my its a several dozen We all found our ice creams to be delicious Employees were attentive and available Prices were up there but considering its in the Venetian what else would one except They also had a wall lined with candy Yup you heard me Ill be back with my local friends and tourists Literally cant wait,positive,82,75-100,444,<500
I find this place to be over rated and service is always poor Slow internet,negative,15,<50,77,<500
Not worthy at all I waited more than 30 minutes in line the service is veeeery bad the whole crew doesnt know how to treat their customers The crÃªpe is good and not that expensive but the tradeoff wasnt good to me,negative,42,25-50,222,<500
Tried to order a cheesecake for my bfs bday I was told to go on their postmates app if I wanted delivery Went through their whole menu pretty long and didnt see any cheesecake Called back to ask if they offer cheesecake because I didnt see it on the app menu  the girl said they definitely do Went back to the postmates app and checked again and did not see the cheesecake ANYWHERE Im kinda bummed cause I really had my heart set on this place for my bfs cake Hopefully the manager sees this so they can fix their menu Or maybe the girl is just mistaken  needs to know their inventory better,negative,116,100-150,609,500-1000
Very friendly atmosphere and owners They have a great selection of ice cream flavors and their halo halo tastes amazing Definitely will be visiting this place often,positive,27,25-50,168,<500

Prestis is my favorite place in Little Italy Offering up stromboli pizza sandwiches and salads Prestis is a one stop shop for lunch in Little Italy They have the absolute best variety of desserts including gelato The cassata cake and chocolate eclairs are MUST tries The restaurant is bathed in natural light and the decor is just so darn modern and pretty Topnotch people watching is an added bonus Come here You wont regret it,positive,75,50-75,445,<500
With all the bakeriespastry shops in Las Vegas with their extravagant display ie Jean Philippe Patisserie youd think a small behind the escalator counter would be flounderingbut not Bouchon Obviously this little boulangerie isnt just a mom and pop shopits owned by the famous Thomas Keller Need I speak more But who cares about the backgroundon to the goods The selection is pretty small but decent for the shops size There are macarons of course cupcakes tartsetc I had a couple macarons raspberry and chocolate both of which are aahhhhhmazingcouldnt ask for anything else Really macarons just make you feel like you should be living like royalty Ã la Marie Antoinette without the headgettingchoppedoff part GASP Wished they had friendlier servicethough maybe my server was just having a bad day you never know Also wished they had a one or two tableschairs to sit on Other than that Yumz,positive,149,100-150,945,500-1000
I love this place so it is hard to write a bad review It was only my second time going to Amelies I have finals this week so I have already been once Today I had been there about an hour studying for my final and a lady was complaining that the meeting room that she scheduled for her group was too small so we were kicked out of our first come first serve room People were complaining about this and not one of the staff members said sorry for what happened There were no other open tables to sit at and Amelies wouldnt open up her original meeting room for us so we were forced to leave In the rain I must add Amelies I had higher expectations for you Obviously your regular customers that were in the room with me dont come first Sorry but definitely wont be going there to sit and study Maybe I will go to Starbucks or Panera where I know I wont be forced to leave,negative,173,150-200,897,500-1000

We tried Churn on our recent visit to Phoenix My son ordered a scoop with two flavors  strawberry and mint chip My husband and I shared a double scoop We were told we could pick up to six flavors but we opted for four We had the toasted coconut chocolate hazelnut strawberry and sweet cream All of the flavors were delicious My favorites were the chocolate hazelnut which had big chunks of nuts and the sweet cream The portions were big A double scoop was enough for two adults to share My son enjoyed his ice cream so much that he asked me to find out if they had a Churn in Los Angeles Unfortunately not The prices were reasonable at about 3 for a scoop a big scoop with 2 flavors and 4 and change for double scoop up to 6 flavors The staff was also friendly and helpful We will definitely return when were in town,positive,159,150-200,842,500-1000
There is a reason why Donut Bar was voted best donut in Las Vegas let alone in the country by numerous sites Donut Bar has a wide variety of donuts that can meet everyones needs All of their donuts are made to perfection They are light fluffy gooey and any other adjective you can think of The french toast donut is the go to donut Just imagine a massive circular french toast covered in powered sugar and then the drizzle of the warm maple syrup Other donuts to consider would be the Big Pappa Donut which has a whole pop tart inside the donut This thing weights 1lb Next you have to get the creme brulee donut which is a soft yeast round filled with creme brulee and topped with caramelized sugar The next must have would be the Oh My Birthday Cake Oreo which is Birthday Cake Oreo stuffed donut topped with cake batter glaze pastel sequins and cookie crumbs This place is also very welcoming The staff is super friendly and the head Chef Jeff is one of the nicest people you will ever meet So if you are in Vegas and you are craving Donuts and coffee They Serve Nitro Cold Brew Too stop by Donut Bar Donut miss out BrandonFitFoodie,positive,214,200-250,1157,1000-1500

Really Seriously This is what all the hype is about Let me just say I was very disapointed Aside from the cannoli the desserts that I got were disgusting They tasted almost rancid or as if they had spoiled I was shocked at the taste Again the canoli was good but the red velvet cake  Duncan Hines in a box taste better and especislly the chocolate mouse cheesecake were rancid tasting and horrible We ended up throwing both away barely touched Hey Buddy here is a tip Before you go across the country rating other peoples bakeries for tv entertainment please take a closer look at your own establishment I have no doubt you have the skill and probdo better than what is presented at your vegas location I dont know who is in charge there but you need to visit and start randomly tasting I have alot if chocolate mousse in my life and alot of cheesecake but none have tasted bitter and rancid I am convinced a step was missed by mistake in the baking process cuz there is no way that could be considered quality or even eatable Get it together I am bothered because this stuff wasnt cheap We wanted to go back and complain because again we thought it had to be a mistake but we had to catch our flight out,negative,228,200-250,1229,1000-1500
To start off the ice cream and desserts are all very great hence for 2 stars but the staff and the how the store is run is very disorganized The last 2 times we came and had to wait about 40 minutes to get order and today we decided to walk in at 1020 for them to tell us they are closed and not letting anyone else in Why advertise that youre open to 11 if youre going to deny people this early Advertise that you close at 1030 then not 11 Definitely needs to have more staff on hand to help,negative,102,100-150,502,500-1000
So happy to see Novel is doing so well The first time I came here it was fairly new and with only a few reviews on Yelp Decided to test the waters since it was the closest place that sold doughnut icecream sandwiches oh and waffle icecream sandwicheswellI actually ended up getting a one scoop in a cone without any toppings because I really just loved the flavor of the icecream itself I believe the flavor was lavender honey Delicious and not overbearing at all A friendly couple owns this shop and one of the owners informed me that their icecream is made locally by an awesome chef He let me sample my heart out until I fell in love with the honey lavender  which is made with real lavender flakes and none of the extract crap  you can taste the difference Overall wonderful experience nice crowd and a small cute shop with lots of icecream to choose from,positive,161,150-200,880,500-1000
I love the pastries here Ive never had to complain about them but the customer service is horrible I bought my dog inside and I was holding him and they told me I had to leave immediately because they do not allow pets inside I understand that but they could have let me order first and then go outside with my dog But no they said I had to leave I couldnt even order what I wanted There should be a sign saying no pets allowed instead of them kicking me out the place I honestly wanted to say something about it but Im not the type of person to create a scene in front of a lot of customers Im very disappointed Never coming to that location again,negative,129,100-150,666,500-1000
I really wanted to like this nostalgic place but the service was terrible The line we had been forewarned was long but quick We got to the window and my partner ordered a medium cake batter shake I ordered a Yintzer sundae and we stepped away to wait The male who took my order called me back over and said they were no longer serving the Yintzer I asked if they had anything similar and he said the chocolate chip cookie sundae was basically the same thing but with a chocolate chip cookie instead of a blonde brownie No biggieI ordered it When we picked up our order at the window the sundae had chocolate sauce instead of caramel I told him I didnt care for chocolate and that I thought it was supposed to be like the Yintzer He said yes you CAN get caramel sauce but its a special request Huh I asked for a Yintzerlike sundae you affirm one exists then play semantics He offered to remake it but I declined and asked for a simple cone with sprinkles He returned several minutes later with a plain cone I asked again if he could put sprinkles on it He did begrudgingly If I wanted to pull teeth Id have gone to dental school Pass this gem upits a cubic zirconia 2 stars because the cake batter shake tasted just like cake batter and the building is pretty cool,negative,241,200-250,1307,1000-1500
This place is retail at its lowest Saturday night here with a huge line They had one person behind the bakery desk who was singing along while 20 guests are waiting Clearly nobody understands the importance of expediting the long line Terrible Where is the manager on duty,negative,48,25-50,279,<500
They do an incredible job at making you feel welcomed and are very proud and passionate about their product which all around makes for an amazing experience This treat was unlike any other and I look forward to going back many many times Also the patio area out front is perfect for relaxing or for someone like me who always has her dog with her  Also  if you do bring your dog they even give your dog its own special little treat So sweet,positive,86,75-100,451,<500
This is the third location we have visited and it was excellent as always We got there a bit late in the morning and the selection was a bit kicked over but the quality was still there,positive,37,25-50,187,<500
I have watched Cake Boss for years since I am a cake decorator and baker as well Buddy has always awed me with his creativity which made me want to try his products I had the chance when we were at LV last week there was no line and they had tons of pastries to choose from But there are no sign or price as to what the items were So its hard to choose more so We opted to just try the cookies mm and chocolate chips and a Christmas sugar cookies Got 3 of each and 1 cheese danish I was so surprised though that all of it rang to more than 40 The kids liked the cookies but they were like any other cookies that you can buy from bakeries that costs less I didnt like the cheese danish because it was too sweet and the pastry itself was a bit hard Id prefer the ones from Panera bread Maybe next time when I get the chance Ill try the cakes We didnt get any at the time since we had some cakes already from another bakeshop,negative,190,150-200,944,500-1000
We were excited to come check it out being Cake Boss fans and all We were staying at the Palazzo I have to say we were very disappointed Its super expensive and the pastries were not good at all We bought a leclare cupcake sized cheesecake and of course the cannoli They were dry cold tasteless and too hard Too bad wont be shopping there to say the least Id rather pay 27 for a nice meal,negative,77,75-100,403,<500
This place used to be my favorite soft serve place But the portions have gotten super small And even the pulling is not as good Usually they take great care into making it look good Of late Its been lopsided uneven and ugly The guy behind the counter needs to be retrained,negative,52,50-75,280,<500
I go here at least once a week The owners and staff here go out of there way to treat you with kindness and respect The want you to be satisfied Highly recommend this place Hidden gem in central Phoenix,positive,40,25-50,207,<500
My gf brought me home a box of donuts while she was working They looked very appealing looks can be deceiving They honestly were probably some of the worst donuts Ive ever had They were very dry and super doughy The donuts at Smiths are wayyyy better than this place I will deft not be returning,negative,56,50-75,303,<500
I have had very mixed experiences with this place but it is the only food french inspired bakery despite the horrendous decor 90 of the time I come the line takes at least 15 minutes because they only have ONE person on the register who is also packing the pastries Not only that but if you manage to get to the front of the line and order your food will take 20 minutes to get I ordered a sandwich Twice now Ive had an awful experience with two of the employees when I was ordering and they gave me attitude If you dont like working in customer service then find another job Idk what to tell you I only gave it two stars because I like the sandwich I get but these experience make me think twice of coming here,negative,140,100-150,731,500-1000
This was by far the best donut ice cream sandwich on the planet The donut was light and complimented the fat Elvis Vanilla ice cream that was stuffed into the donutHeavenly Smack your mamma Delicious,positive,35,25-50,211,<500
We happened upon this epic little spot during a minivacation to visit Phoenix and what a lucky find I felt like I was stepping back into the 50s  or at least what I think it would be like From the employees rolling fresh waffle cones for real to the adorable young women who took our order the place was just incredible Their ice cream was amazing and the most incredible part  as we were waiting for our order the owner stopped by to ask how long wed be waiting It had maybe been a total of 2 minutes they were very busy on a Saturday night He just wanted to make sure it hadnt been too long I cannot remember the last time I have experienced excellent product great ambiance and phenomenal customer service all in one visit Wish we lived there so I could visit more often,positive,150,100-150,796,500-1000
Great place to grab some coffee and a beignets before heading to the pool be warned the chocolate beignets sell out early,positive,22,<50,123,<500
I finally decided to give Milkbar a try and realized why I was avoiding it in the first place You are paying for a name and something that has trended on Instagram Perhaps at her original Bakery when she was making the products herself they were balanced and delicious but here I have some person shoving a cold pie in my hand and my first bite was nothing but the taste of sugar and then my second bite was more sugar and then on the third I finally got hints of butter but for the most part its fairly flavorless and for 7 thats just ridiculous The overall texture is nice but feels like its missing something Theres no contrast or balance at all It tastes like something a twoyearold would make Save your 7 and go buy a pack of gummy bears thats what I ended up doing and the gummies were tastier,negative,154,150-200,818,500-1000
Love this place cool options and good options for those not too adventurous Tasty ice cream so fresh and I had the coffee float with sesame ice cream DELICIOUS,positive,29,25-50,162,<500
Great ice cream but mask policy is non existent Outside or not there are often a lot of massless customers in line not social distancing I mostly wont go because its so unsafe The owner needs to put a mandate in place and enforce it No mask no shoes no service,negative,51,50-75,267,<500
Woohoo What a treat by UIUC They feature a new custard flavor every week and last week it was cake batter although the sample I tried of it tasted like french vanilla The custard texture is smooth and creamy and not too sweet Their menu houses a variety of frozen treats from custard to snowstorms to floats and cakes I got the coffee oreo snowstorm and it was delish Dont underestimate the sizes I got a 12oz and it was more than I anticipated The snowstorm wasnt as thick as a DQ blizzard but it was light and creamy easy to finish They also have a drive thru The building itself looks like a diner bringing with it an old school charm Jarlings you are darling If youre looking for a cool treat in the humidity think no more and come to Jarlings,positive,143,100-150,778,500-1000
Bought 70 worth of coffee and pastries For Bouchons brand and pricing of products I would expect service to be with the brand There was nothing special when it came to their service Felt like fast food type  got your orders pushed food products out No smiles or warmth of service Sad coz I was very excited about experiencing Bouchon If first impressions last sad that this was my first impression,negative,72,50-75,411,<500
What is the hype about I have been want to try this place for a while and I was so disappointed Got there at 1140 on a Friday so there were only three types of donuts left Crete brÃlÃe strawberry cheesecake and Nutella overload I wasnt disappointed with the lack of selection as I would have chose two if the three anyway They were dry and all disappointing in flavor The brÃlÃe topping tasted burnt and not sweet and the cream was almost tasteless The strawberry cheese cake was a jelly filled with cheesecake icing I guess Not enough filling  couldnt taste anything like cheesecake and the filling tasted cheap The Nutella overload an underload with not enough filling It was straight Nutella which was the only saving grace of the donut experience They did have nitro cold brew which I tried and it was good but their cold brew was bitter and not smooth Will not try this place again,negative,162,150-200,910,500-1000
I am SOOOOOO excited about this new Sprinkles location Ive been telling all my Las Vegas friends how much I miss living in the Bay Area near the Palo Alto sprinkles and now I dont have to anymore Also very excited about the ice cream situation here and the Cupcake ATM The Linq is definitely worth walking through and make sure you save time for a cupcake,positive,67,50-75,361,<500
What a horrible experience when they decide to LOCK the doors at 852 and they close at 900 I was horrified when the staff chose to LOCK the doors early at 852 when they close at 900 and 2 customers were waiting to enter Im Italian and Im shocked at the behavior of the employees that felt the need to lock the doors 8 minutes before it was officially closed I dont understand why this unacceptable behavior is now commonplace in our society today I really feel like they should be ashamed of themselves for their selfish behavior,negative,98,75-100,543,500-1000
Fatty Daddys is the new ice cream spot in my neighborhood so i had to give it a try DANGEROUSLY GOOD Ive been craving a cookie cup since Friday After trying every single flavor because they have so many I got a vanilla macaroon with the coffee ice cream The cookies are soft but so chewy at the same time and the ice cream has so much flavors The marshmallow on top is what makes the entire cookie cup Everyone who works there is so nice and helpful Hands down best dessert stop in Scottsdale,positive,95,75-100,504,500-1000
The most mediocre place ever smelled like chemicals when we walked in A SMALL ass scoop for 5 And 1 for every topping Gee thanks for my 4 sprinkles Never coming back here again,negative,34,25-50,189,<500

Ahh freaking mazing Walked in greeted right away The staff made recommendations for which donuts to try They had so many options They also had drip coffee or made to order coffee drinks The prices were reasonable and well worth it I wish I lived close to this but Im also happy I dont ,positive,55,50-75,296,<500
Yum I have only tried a handful of goodies from here and they were all very good However I think its the ambiance of the bakery that really does it for me It is so pretty and romantic in there The perfect spot to take a date to for a sweet treat after 10pm  they are open till 11pm  They even have vegan offerings I cant say much for service because both times I was there it was empty and everyone working seem pleasant,positive,86,75-100,432,<500
Strike 1 The dry confetti cake Strike 2 The desecration of an already perfect classic chess pie Gummy and one note served ice cold Strike 3The prices I should have known better when I saw everything being mass produced in a commissary on Netflixs Chefs Table Frosting the outside of a cake does serve a purpose to keep it from drying out,negative,62,50-75,352,<500
Delicious creations and great variety of flavors Decided to finally give this place a try and safe to say we will be back I tried almond butter toffee and milk  cookies in a waffle bowl and my husband had a salted butter caramel milkshake His shake was amazingly delicious Both of my flavors were greatId hold off on the waffle next time not totally worthy This place is worth a trip to Very clean wellstaffed and not too pricy,positive,80,75-100,446,<500
Once a quaint little house Now a cart Owners mixed it up from buying the restraint where it sits outside A little disappointed they were still selling ice cream worh the freezing machine broken down It meant melted icecream Was still good but killed the experience,negative,46,25-50,270,<500
Im a pastry chef by trade and have to say that this is the BEST place in town if you want pastry and breads from people who know what theyre doing Cash only though Minute drawback but makes sense when you consider how much it costs to run credit cards,positive,50,25-50,260,<500

I honestly wish we had Handels in Denver CO I was in the Summerlin area and wanted to try some new desserts It was between ice cream and boba It was a tough decision but honestly the reviews at Handels interested me How is this place getting consistent 5 stars I checked out the menu and saw all the raves about Graham Central Station whoneycomb and Graham Canyon wbutter toffee and decided I needed to go and try it out for myself No walkin ice cream shop but theres plenty of seats and benches The long lines can be quite a bit of a deterrence BUT DONT LET THAT STOP YOU This ice cream is so worth it Our server was patient and allowed us to try 4 samples before we settled on a flavor This company does not lie when they say they dont skimp on the cones and the ice cream I was thrilled to see how far my 5 goes get the waffle cone its worth it The ice cream is so smooth and contains so much flavor I would say though for the Graham Canyon my scoop had a bit too much butter toffee in it and it was rather sweet by the time I reached the waffle Other than that amazing ice cream worth the money worth the wait I cant wait to come back to Las Vegas and try more flavors,positive,237,200-250,1217,1000-1500
I was so excited to try this place but my entire experience was brought down by one employee He was so rude and unwelcoming He wouldnt even answer our questions when we needed clarification I wasnt able to get his name because they dont have name tags He wasnt able to hear me through my mask so he looked at me with a stank face and continued to speak to us with a negative attitude So mean and unprofessional I would have rather gone elsewhere if I had known about the poor service,negative,93,75-100,494,<500
Delicious pastries and lunch Love the atmosphere too,positive,8,<50,55,<500
The ice cream here is amazing Easily the top ice cream Ive had in vegas so far They have tons of flavors My husband and I both got a four scoop sampler I tried the salted caramel truffle my favorite the cookie dough the banana cream pie which really tastes like its name and the chocolate marshmallow My only suggestion would be to make the chocolate marshmallow more marshmallowy its just the chocolate ice cream with marshmallows in it and I was expecting more throughout My husband got plain chocolate and vanilla cotton candy and the watermelon ice Usually ice has no taste but this one was so tasty I cant wait to go back and try more They also gave my toddler a free baby cone of vanilla The prices are really great we spent 9 and change and I gave the girl a 10 and told her to keep it and she was super grateful just for that little tip I highly recommend this place it was perfect to sit outside at nice with my family and enjoy a treat,positive,182,150-200,978,500-1000

We came here last week for the first time and there was quite a line we waited patiently with our two dogs and a good 20 mins later got to the window Well no wonder there was such a wait the guy took our order one at a time Made mine came back to give it to me and then asked what my girlfriend wanted Ive been to many other walk up ice cream spots different cities mind you and they take your order as a whole There would also be more than three people working Annoying So whatever The ice cream was really only okay Id rather Coldstone or Smiths brand for that matter But we come back a few days later on Wednesday for a second try and the line was still so long We stood in it for 7 minutes and it didnt even move So we left and went to Coldstone I cant imagine what the wait timelines are going to be like when Summer actually hits No thank you,negative,174,150-200,875,500-1000

Been here several times every time the service has been terrible My last visit here the guy working didnt acknowledge us when we walked in acted rude and made it seem like we were a burden for being there I asked to try two flavors and ended up ordering the taro after I tried it I wanted to try another flavor but I didnt want to ruin this guys night any more than I already had by asking to try a third My friend also pointed out to me that there had been a fly in the mango sorbet while we were there and the guy had simply scooped it out Other reviewers have said the ice cream was icy but that hasnt been my experience I enjoyed it enough to give it several tries but it isnt worth the consistently awful service Ive received here The ice cream itself deserves 4 stars They have good flavors that are fun and it has a good consistency to it However even the best ice cream would be ruined by a dirty shop with flies and bad service,negative,186,150-200,961,500-1000

I wish I was giving this place just 2 stars because of the kind of terrible service I hadbut the ice cream just isnt that great either The flavors are not creative and the ice cream is just mediocre Absolutely nothing special here The last time I was there the service was very slow and it seemed obvious that the employees did not enjoy their jobs I ordered a one scoop in a sugar cone and she dropped half of the scoop into the freezer then plopped the half of a scoop lopsided on the cone I tried to ask her for a bowl to put it in but I was clearly bothering her I got the attention of another employee who gave me a bowl then asked her to clean up the mess yet didnt offer me an apology  or the other half of my scoop I probably will not be visiting again Dont mess with my ice cream,negative,161,150-200,809,500-1000

Im totally disappointed ExteriorLocation Small red building in Clevelands south side Interior red and white interior bakery shelves and cases VibeAmbiance I was under the impression I would be eating the most fabulous doughnut ever Staff there were 2 people working at the time An older women who was cleaning and a younger girl working the counter The younger girl basically asked us if we wanted a dozen doughnuts No enthusiasm or affect I was even more confused because she was offering me a dozen of chocolate doughnuts which was all that was left Clientele could be anyone I saw young and older people pulling in after we left Price I dont know I only bought 3 doughnuts Must get items Krispy Kreme doughnuts that are 6 miles away Why I love or hate it not a fan Final thoughts this was a total disappointment I drove out the this place after reading so much about it on Yelp As a lover of doughnuts and an aficionado I was so excited to try what I wanted to be the best doughnut ever I walked in greeted by a teenage girl who wanted to know if I wanted a dozen doughnuts I looked at the cases and they were empty How could the shelves be empty It was 400 pm and this place is open until 800 pm There was one small baking sheet left with only three kinds of doughnuts I told her I would try one of each My daughter and I eagerly ran to the car to eat our doughnuts Upon first bite I was annoyedthey were so average I was embarrassed that I even drove out My daughter and I decided that we would take a short ride to Krispy Kreme a few miles away for what we found to be food nirvana I dont need to come back to Jack Frosts Totally not worth the calories,negative,320,300- 500,1713,1500-2000
Decided to stop by and check it out because Im craving for the chocolate creme cheese bread Since its still soft opening they have very limited items No mocha bread no taro bread all my faves were out Stopped by 1127 and got a couple of breads and a chocolate hot tea At that time there was a long line inside and out and they were only letting a couple of people in It was utterly sweet There was curds of chocolate I ended up having to toss it out I know they are on training but come on when you stir it you can see the curds of chocolate I cant understand why they would serve it Hopefully with this review theyll take it to account and make their items the correct way I love 85 degrees and I cant wait for it to fully be operational and be up to the same consistency as the ones in Cali,negative,160,150-200,811,500-1000

I am so happy that they finally brought 85 into the Las Vegas area The pastries and cakes here are so delicious and bring a hint of Asia to our little tourist town From their jalapeno cream cheese bread to the taro bread to the milk buns and egg tarts You cant really go wrong when you come here If you like salt then maybe you want to try the sea salt coffee but I normally go with an iced Americano Whats even better is that they box everything up and put them in individual little bags which allow them to stay fresher and keeps the taste If you have a birthday coming up they have some pretty sweet cakes too and delicious tiramisu Its kind of loud and packed here normally because its so good so I would caution you that you might find all the tables occupied if youre looking to sit down If you havent been here you probably should and its in the new Shanghai plaza with some cool little restaurants nearby Obviously with whats going on now everything is pretty much take out and youll still be happy leaving this delicious establishment,positive,197,150-200,1063,1000-1500
Yepthese donuts are definitely mainly for Instagram Grabbed a dozen different donuts for the fam preordered online and despite the interestingsounding flavors none of them really stood out Donuts were really dry and bready I picked up the donuts at 9 am Some of them were surprisingly bland The only redeeming quality is the staff super friendly people,negative,58,50-75,369,<500
Hey Buddy F You When you charge 11 for a tiny slice of cheesecake you better be giving people the best cheesecake they had in their lives That ship was the consistency of cottage cheese flavored like lemon The cannoli barely had five or six chocolate chips in it you cheap bastard Save your money and go get anything from the supermarket at least that way they dont laugh behind your back as youre walking out,negative,76,75-100,421,<500

I seriously felt like shedding a tear once I heard Milk Bar was moving closer to me Its a must stop when I am in NYC The Cosmopolitan is a great match for location choice The quality of Ingredients is apparent in each yummy item I got their Greatest Hits Crack Pie is crack Its so decadent without being sweet Compost cookie is amazing as are the other cookie offerings Bday and Chocolate Malt truffles are so good Wish they offered the chocolate chip passionfruit ones in LV though Cereal Milk ice cream and all of its shootoffs are so good There is a place near me called Afters that had a cereal milk ice cream which came AFTER Milk Bar and it fills a need when I get the craving but in no way is it on the same level Prices are super high but at least the quality matches Bring Milk Bar or Orange County or LA please,positive,160,150-200,837,500-1000

Be prepared to wait in line and look at the menu while you are waiting in line I had a large cannoli and a hazelnut cream puff It was my last day in Vegas and I was trying to be good Everything in the glass looks inviting Staff was super friendly and speedy loved that this bakery was at the Venetian which I was also staying at,positive,67,50-75,341,<500

The baked items looked nice and tasted okay but they are on the same level as baked goods from Costco I wouldnt recommend this place plan on coming back here The coffee was okay too,negative,35,25-50,185,<500
I wish I loved you I wish we would have worked out Maybe Ill give you another go when Im in the area The workers there were friendly so I gave two stars WHY I DIDNT LIKE IT Donuts dry I tried several too The creme brulee which I thought I would love but the sugary top made it hard for me to eat The birthday cake one with the oreo in it was super dry The blueberry donut was the saving grace out of the donuts Pretty moist and flavorful but not enough for me to want to go back there WHY I NEED TO GO BACK I came late maybe thats why the donuts were dry I dont know I want that strawberry whipped cream one It looks good so Ill go early to try it Everyone needs a second chance,negative,143,100-150,706,500-1000

A quintessential Italian bakery with a very tasty albeit limited lunch menu Everything in the bakery cases is delicious so just go hogwild Everytime I come here I buy an entire box of baked items because theyre just that good The staff are friendly although not admittedly speedy as has been mentioned before the person preparing your stuff kind of does everything themselves so heated orders or complex orders slow down the line And parking is Little Italy so mentally prepare for that That said any time I have a free afternoon I find any reason that I can to come by this place Thanks Prestis,positive,106,100-150,617,500-1000

I came here for one thing and one thing only the big poppa tart They had a strawberry one I think and a smores one so I went the smores route It was a good donut Soft dough with a chocolate and graham cracker filling I appreciated that it wasnt too sweet despite all the things on it and how big it was Im not sure if its a 5 star donut shop since while the big poppa tart is unique the flavors and quality is about the same as other donut shops Ive been to not a bad thing so I guess Ill have to come back and try more donuts and see how those are,positive,117,100-150,568,500-1000

Ill never understand what all the hype is about Jack Frost I feel really bad for giving a negative review about such a historic local business but theyre just not that good First off theyre cashonly which is just utterly ridiculous in 2019 for a business with a storefront ie nonmobile location Second their donuts are extremely cosmetically appealing but dont actually taste good and are not very good quality The dough itself is very bland and not sweet and is always somewhat stiff and staletasting no matter what time of day that you go Their toppings are slightly below average tastewise and they are unfortunately notorious for NEVER putting filling in any of their donuts They just put everything on top This usually means that theres about half a teaspoon of filling sitting in the dimple on top the donut with the rest of the stuff being just whipped cream or other toppings This leads to their flavored donuts just tasting like crappy dough with only one or two bites where you can actually taste the intended flavor Also the donuts that they recently brought to the vending booth at the Cleveland Zoos Asian Lantern Festival were even worse than the ones at the regular location They were so stale that they were crunchycrispy despite being in a temperaturecontrolled case That did not reflect well on their business at all and I overheard numerous other people complaining while they were walking around and eating their donuts Overall Im getting really tired of giving them chance after chance and always having the donuts suck every single time If you want fancy donuts that are highquality just go to your local familyowned bakery instead If you want cheap but highquality dounuts quickly then just go to Giant Eagle Heinens or Drug Mart who all have excellent donuts for great prices Theres absolutely no reason to go to Jack Frost with all the other better options that are around the Greater Cleveland area,negative,331,300- 500,1985,1500-2000
My daughter brought me a cupcake from the atm yesterday from a recent visit to vegas since i never had one It was cinnamon It started as delicious treat until i found a long curly hair in it Yuk Never again,negative,41,25-50,211,<500
The Neopolitan  simply phenomenal A little surprised at the toughness of the top layer Breaking through with a fork resulted in largely collapsing the structure expelling the filling out all sides The top layer is really the key to the flavor profile but the filling provides a textural element that enhances the overall experience by contrasting with the crunch of the pastry Also had the salty caramel brownie It was quite good The caramel had a soft texture,positive,79,75-100,469,<500
The Butterwood Bake Consortium is a gem of a place and exactly the sort of spot Upper Lawrenceville was lacking Only a year ago there werent any good places to grab coffee or tea and pastries past 52nd street With this covering desserts coffee and tea and the nearby B52 cafe the area is lacking no longer I came here with a friend who had been wanting to try it with me I arrived a bit earlier than she did and was greeted by the lovely woman behind the counter I ordered a vegan blackberry vanilla cake and inquired about the tea options She let me smell the different types of tea and I chose the peppermint which I thought would be light enough to pair with the cake The chestnut tea smelled excellent and I will be back to try some with a dark chocolate dessert I sat at one of the Victorian garden style tables and my order was brought out to me in under five minutes The cake had been warmed up and the tea came with a little timer for steeping Everything tasted delicious By this time my friend had arrived and selected chocolate mouse and an espresso She felt much the same about the quality of her dessert I was offered more water for a second cup of tea and we sat and chatted for over an hour as the place became progressively more full and lively There was even a book club I loved seeing how much people were enjoying themselves Dessert here is going to be a regular occurrence,positive,266,250-300,1418,1000-1500
Not what I would expect from a French bakery Have been there several times and its always slammed line around the corner and takes forever and cant find a table or a chair Very hectic and chaotic atmosphere definitely not welcoming or relaxing ,negative,44,25-50,255,<500
I was super excited to try the pastries here but I was so disappointed The pastries look ok and taste like the typical grocery store pastries I was hoping to try new flavors Nothing special just waste of money Wont ever go back,negative,43,25-50,233,<500
Great ice cream at a cute shop This ice cream store is located in a small wooden house as a part of a group of other small houses surrounding a small patiolike area The area has an overall kitschy vibe to it as the decorations on the patio are eclectic and each house is painted a different color You order your ice cream at a windowfront with the menu posted next to the window The workers are very sweet friendly and ready to explain the menu for any firsttimers My personal favorite here is the honey lavender as Im a sucker for floral flavors and its sweet and light You can order a pint to take home for the classic flavors which is perfect when you dont want to make the drive over to just get ice cream Your order also comes with a mini stroopwafel which is a nice addition of texture and sweetness to the ice cream As a heads up parking can be kind of difficult as theres only residential and some sparse meter parking I once came here in the nighttime and there happened to be a car show going on and it was near impossible to find any parking Nevertheless if I ever get the chance I always stop by to have their ice cream,positive,220,200-250,1159,1000-1500
I did not like the canoli and the the tiramisu tasted like a lot of whip cream We tried the red velvet and it was just okay The brownie with walnuts were good but basically with what we got I wasnt wowed enough to really go back Carlos really must be a favorite on the east coast but at the prices of the bakery items I just wasnt impressed,negative,69,50-75,347,<500
I sooo love their milk chocolate cupcake Its heaven in your mouth I think they are open until 1am but dont you worry because its Vegas baby Almost everything is open 247 in The Strip so they have a 247 cupcake atm at The Linq near the High Roller Its too expensive for a cupcake though I paid 450 for a piece of cupcake when I used their cupcake atm the other night,positive,73,50-75,384,<500
Paid 18 for 2 tiny sandwich cookies I was expecting to get a warm cookie ice cream sandwich at least the size of the palm of my hand the cookie ice cream sandwiches were advertised as big Cookie ice cream sandwiches turned out to be tiny practically frozen and hard to eat,negative,52,50-75,280,<500
The only reason this place got 2 stars instead of 1 is because of the great raw clams and oysters Unfortunately they werent even served with a mignonette What kind of place serves a raw bar with cocktail sauce Geez The shrimp and grits were yucky The beignets were heavy and hard and crusty Not light and fluffy at all Definitely will not be going to any other Bouchons,negative,69,50-75,378,<500

If this is what you called service than I guess I should never have tipped The service is definitely hitandmiss at this location I am a regular here when I stay at the Venetian the cashier was taking my order and in the middle of my order taking she turned over to the two baristas askingdiscussing about something  possibly about an order she took for the person in front of me FINE She continues to take my order I asked is your latte sweet She said no So I said great I will take a large iced latte I will also have an iced tea easy on the ice please And a double shots of espresso Got my order I was a bit confused why I got a hot latte opposed to an iced latte So I told the barista as seen in the photo that I ordered an iced latte OMG here comes the condescending remark  well did you tell her that With her big eyes eyeballing at me I responded yes I did The barista turned around askingtelling the cashier The cashier came toward me telling me you told me you wanted iced coffee you said latte you didnt say iced latte I responded first I asked you if the latte was sweet or not you said unsweetened and thats when I said Id like an iced latte I also said iced tea easy on the iced me thinking to myself how many times do I have to say iced mine you they are not even busy After speaking with the cashier she took away the hot latte and she told to the barista just make a new one The barista took the hot latte and threw it right in the trash with FAT CHIP ON HER SHOULDER as if the world is coming to an end and that she needs to sacrifice her life to make me an iced latte well maybe I was exaggerating but seriously that was the attitude I got I mean gesh She could just put the ice in a new cup and pour the hot latte over I would have been fine but no she wants to make it even harder on herself,negative,373,300- 500,1911,1500-2000

Not worth the hype unless your getting something Made to order like the milk ice cream The cookies and milk bar are pre made and packaged For the price you would expect a warm cookie and something tasting freshly made instead your getting a cold cookie and milk bar slice Disappointed especially for price,negative,54,50-75,309,<500

STOP This is what I observed during my visit tonight Saturday March 20 2021 at 915 PM The same staff member that takes your order and money goes to the dipping case to scoop your ice cream without washing his hands or wearing a pair of gloves At best this is not sanitary and worst they could be spreading COVID19 We all know that money is filthy and we should wash our hands after handling it The unsafe practices at the establishment should be criminal God know just how many unsuspecting customers caught the COVID19 virus from this place,negative,99,75-100,555,500-1000
I think Batch is one of my favorite bakery in Madison They got me with the Chocolate Croissants and I stayed for well everything else You cant go wrong from their artisanal bread pies or pastries The chocolate croissant will always have a place in my heart The croissant is so flaky buttery and golden and the chocolate inside taste like very high quality chocolate They do large orders for special events and cater weddings Check their website for their bread rotations Closed Mondays,positive,84,75-100,502,500-1000

This place is a cool concept for sure Donuts and beer This makes sense to me Every day their vegan selection changes and you take your chances if you dont get there early But since they do change out their vegan selection you might be able to try a variety of flavors in just a few visits The service has been great the two times Ive been in Sadly I havent even paired a donut with a beer just yet Im slacking on my day drinking apparently All the donuts look awesome and Im sure are good Ive heard good things about the samoa Girl Scout style donut Ive had the creme brÃlÃe I wish it had more filling Had to eat the whole donut before finding any filling until the last bite I am anticipating some flavors like the spiced chai for sure I will definitely be back and you should swing by if you havent yet They close at 1pm and happy hour is just before You could score two for one,positive,174,150-200,909,500-1000

When Carlos opened several years ago it was extremely good Good selection great flavor The past few years the selection is terrible but occasionally Ive found a tasty cupcake or something minor to eat The last time the cupcake was terrible so this past week I decided on just cookies Three different kinds of cookies from chocolate to sugar to chocolate chip to snickerdoodlethey all tasted the same 1800 for four cookies and my husband and I wound up throwing most of them away I cant believe that thiishment to go down hill the way that it has Simply putthe only reason it stays open in my opinion is because people who visit Vegas may never go again Ive finally learned my lessonI will never waste my money on another Carlos item,negative,132,100-150,761,500-1000

Not too impressed with the prices or quality of this semi new ice cream place The lone asian women behind the counter was nice but this shop immediately reminded me of one of those asian donut shops you see in every city The donuts in those places are not usually good and the ice cream here was less than memorable as well First off make the size of the sundae bigger or lower the 650 price of that sundae Its not even a sundae technically because it has no syrup You get two small scoops of bad ice cream i needed to try 5 flavors to find decent one two stale macaroons and that famous toasted marshmallow One person with me had a bad aftertaste for at least an hour after the nutella My flavor was cinnamon toast crunch which like many flavors are just vanilla with cereal tossed inside If your gonna overpay for ice cream go to creamistry BTW  If you go non sundae prices are normal,negative,170,150-200,911,500-1000

Ive visited this establishment on February 8 2020 along with my three family members We ordered three small ice cream cups a large milkshake and a small milkshake The small milkshake cup was only halffull as it was the leftover amount from the container from making the large milkshake I didnt mind too much that I was charged fullprice for half a cup but then we sat down to eat The milkshakes were so watery that they couldnt really pass for a milkshake but the store had become busy so it wasnt worth going back and have her add more ice cream At age 66 I cant recall having such a poorly made milkshake in my life It was just watery milk with an ice cream taste It was so blatantly obvious so the only reasonable explanation is that she simply didnt care Likewise she wasnt friendly and I didnt want to make a scene The price of the order was 2687 which was markedly high for the subpar quality of the product and crappy service In summary I wont be visiting this establishment ever again and if youre looking for a nice ice cream shop in this area you may want to look around for alternate choice Regards,negative,209,200-250,1151,1000-1500
Ive been to Bouchon bakery in Yountville and the one at the Venetian casino pales in comparison We ordered an epi bead which was stale we ordered the chocolate bouchons which were dry and 2 cinnamon rolls which were also very dry I dont know if these pastries were old but it is not even close to the scale of deliciousness of the food you get from Yountville I hope they do something to fix this becasue it would be ashame to have such a fantastic bakery become mediocre,negative,89,75-100,478,<500
Ive been coming here since this place opened im a local and i work on the strip so this place is usually where i go to get my dessert fix I went in ordered cannolis and other cookies The guy helping me didnt move around to grab my stuff this time so i was wondering when he was going to put my desserts in the box Then he said to go to the register and they would have my goodies in a bit I went over to the register and the cashier said the order back to me and it was completely wrong So i told her my actual order and she looked confused then she rang my card Almost 70 bucks Later the guy comes back with my bag and one box and a horrible attitude and i said thank you and left I get to my car open the box and see half the items i ordered are missing So i walk all the way back go to the register talk to the lady that rang me and she once again looks super confused She gets who seems to be her supervisor and he brings me my receipt and tells me he isnt going to charge me extra because the computer didnt charge me tax Then i told him that i was up there because i was missing half the stuff in my order so he goes and talks to the dude that took my order They start gathering my stuff and then get handed my stuff with a less than pleasant attitude he likely thought i was lying even though the first box was already full and i never got my second box for my other stuff Anyway I get in my car and its still the WRONG COOKIES I was so mad lolSo i just went home Sorry for the rant everyone but im so tired of dealing with their nasty attitudes They always look so annoyed when people order So I wont be back if youre looking for a good place try Freeds Bakery ,negative,350,300- 500,1714,1500-2000
Everytime Ive come there has been a line all the way past Hawkers Standing there you can overhear people laugh at you for waiting so long just for ice cream Little do they know that this is the best and most consistent ice cream in Charlotte I have tried several samples but I always end up ordering some variation of scoops with the Milkiest and Darkest Chocolate The Milkiest chocolate is simple and delightful and most certainly can be appreciated by all ages It isnt chalky or malty or fake like some other ice creams I love to start off with this simple and sweet flavor then have others follow The Darkest Chocolate it silky smooth and rich Theres so much coco that if they added any more to it theyd have to call it fudge I noticed it doesnt melt as fast as the Milkiest so I usually have them put it on the bottom of my cone They make their waffle cones and waffle bowls and with the line moving as fast as it does you can expect it to be fresh It really adds to the already wonderful ice cream I love Jenis 3,positive,197,150-200,1037,1000-1500
I lived in Cleveland from August 2011  Feb 2018 I am not exactly sure when I discovered Mitchells  likely when they opened in Ohio City at this location  but I consider all previous years totally wasted Mitchells is the best ice cream I have since moved away from the Land and withe the exception of my friends I miss only 2 things  my jacuzzi tub and Mitchells Favorite flavors include  Wild Berry Crumble Butter Pecan Toasted Pistachio and Praline Pecan I often took pints togo but protip  they will give you 3 cones cake or sugar with your pint as well as complimentary topping sides  i suggest the shaved chocolate Also  make sure to get a pretzel stick  pretty sure they are complimentary And then buy a brownie,positive,137,100-150,744,500-1000

Three stars because their cupcakes are delicious but spending 375 for one regular sized cupcake is ridiculous I had bought one of each to try them over a few days My favorite was the lemon meringue My least favorite was the cinnamon sugar The lemon meringue was worth the 375 It took a lot of effort and creativity to come up with that one The cinnamon sugar was basically a muffin Dont be fooled when you look at this one it does not have frosting A cupcake has frosting This highly disappointing muffin is nothing special at all Ill be back but not often,negative,104,100-150,575,500-1000

Alright because I wanted to find out what Bouchon bakery had to offer I decided to plead with my husband on heading over to the Venetian and grabbing some macarons With much hesitation he finally agreed This is going to be a short review but definitely to the point 1 Chocolate Eclair ugh Disgusting The chocolate filling was too bitter and it left that made yesterday taste Which it probably was 2 Macaron Im sorry but macarons are not suppose to be more chewy than a stick of gum And it was chewy I lost faith in Bouchons macarons here I thought they may blow LaDuree or even Lette macarons out of the water but they did not Even my husband whos not big into sweets even thought Lette macarons were good 3 Carrot Cake Cookie didnt taste bad but Id still settle for the Trader Joes Karat cake Will I come back Most likely not I dont think its worth it Thank goodness the restaurant is a whole other thing,negative,171,150-200,945,500-1000

Delicious home made icecream There was a line when we went in November but the line moves fast I had their strawberry icecream and normally I cant finish my own but I devoured their strawberry icecream You can also add fluff to your icecream toppings and itll make it taste all the better,positive,53,50-75,294,<500
I scrolled through Google to find the closest Boba place and found Rewind It was so worth the 15 minutes I LOVED EVERYTHING I ORDERED The staff was so kind and friendly the atmosphere was so calming A good place to sit down and enjoy your boba The decor is so aesthetically pleasing It was so delicious I almost cried it was gone The rose milk latte was so fresh and sweet which is how I love my boba I also tried the house coffee with rose cream not pictured was so good and refreshing It was Literal perfection I cannot wait to come back,positive,105,100-150,554,500-1000

Good icecream Sometimes Very inconsistent Sometimes the ice cream is soft like pudding other times hard I mentioned this and was told I would get a gift card for my pudding for ice cream and never received it Bad follow through considering a cup of ice cream is 800,negative,49,25-50,277,<500
I had talked up the soft serve here because in my memory the cereal milk soft serve was amazing Alas that was not the case when I brought a couple people here in December 2019 We tried all the soft serves they had and they were all too sweet and tbh the cereal milk has a tinge of vomit taste we didnt even finish the samples The texture was also more custardy than traditional soft serves I spent the rest of the trip trying to redeem my reputation surrounding food In short do not recommend the soft serve here Nope,negative,100,75-100,532,500-1000
My husband took my son and me here on our last trip to Cleveland and we all enjoyed our ice cream I loved their honey pecan ice cream which was recommended by the employee who was helping us My son and husband loved the cookies and cream They have a few picnic tables to enjoy your treats I would definitely come back the next time we visit,positive,67,50-75,346,<500
got a crack pie soft serve and a slice of crack pie You get a pretty huge serving of ice cream Its way to sweet however and I have the ultimate sweet tooth I was disappointed in the options available I suppose Pinterest hyped it up a bit to much great service also,negative,53,50-75,269,<500
A pleasant Spring afternoon brought us to Little Italy last Saturday After walking up and down Mayfield and Murray Hill we stopped at Prestis a charming Italian bakerycafe for lunch Pizza Stromboli Antipasti Italian Wedding Soup Panetone Gelato Tiramisu Macaroons Biscotti Cannoli Cassata Cake Espresso Cappuccino  more This place has it all I ordered a slice of sausage  pepper pizza The sausage wasnt cut into little medallions or arranged in a nice neat fashion either Envision an entire sausage link smothered with red and green peppers on top of the pizza Eating it involved folding up the pizza like a hotdog bun and digging in The idea was pure genius They also boast a charming outdoor seating area right outside the cafe and overlooking Mayfield Road Serves as a great location for people watching,positive,136,100-150,836,500-1000

Sprinkles is my goto place to get cupcakes I love all the flavors Ive tried so far my favorite is the peanut butter chocolate cupcake Right here is the mini sundae which is one of their classic flavored cupcakes cut in half with one scoop of any flavored ice cream for 350 I did the red velvet cupcake with coconut fudge almond ice cream You can add scoops is youd like the regular sized sundaes are 7 for any flavored cupcake and one full scoop of ice cream which you can too add more scoops to The workers at the Linq location always bring my desserts out quickly and are bubbly and nice leaving me with an awesome experience every time Most of all I love the quality flavor and freshness of Sprinkles cupcakes and Ice cream,positive,137,100-150,744,500-1000
I have to say that this is one of my favorite places to go period The atmosphere and decor are very unique and that is one of the reasons I love it so much It is a great place to go for a cute date with your honey and a fun place to hang with your friends I love that they are open 247 The coffee is great and all of the bakery items are top of the line The sandwiches and soups are a bit pricey and small portioned however they taste incredible and are worth getting every so often Definitely worth checking out if you have never been here,positive,111,100-150,550,500-1000
What is not to like On a day where the sun starts to sizzle taking away the crisp dew that was there the morning before Mitchells hits the spot Courteous staff homemade beautifully crafted ice cream and the ambiance make for a stupendous way to cool down A must stop for visitors to Cleveland,positive,54,50-75,301,<500
I was very disappointed to see that the lobster tails are twice as small now I was here two years ago and they were a great size that I didnt care paying seven dollars for it Now they are very very small and not worth paying almost six dollars for it at all They were to hard the flakes of the pastry were not crunchy they seemed staled and I had to be careful not to poke the roof of my mouth with every bite I am so disappointed as I am a huge fan of his show but if they continue to not care for the quality of he product I dont think It will be coming back I am so sad I really loved their lobster tail,negative,129,100-150,620,500-1000
Stopped by and picked out a variety of pastries There are many choices in the glass cases and if youre a first time visitor you will need some extra time to decide what suits you We filled up a box with eight relatively small pastries Items included were cupcake brownie shorties galette macaroon and muffinlike lemon berry baby The shorties are bite sized fancifully frosted shortbread cookie stacks in a variety of flavors Each shortie is about the size of a 25 cent coin They were tasty but not exactly satisfying due to the tiny size The coconut macaroon was flavorful as was the dark chocolate brownie The sunny baby with berries was quite dense and a bit light on flavor The box of pastries cost about 21 and we paid between 150 macaroon to 4 cupcake per item Heartier options like the delicious looking pretzel and the gruyere croissant would be my choices on a future visit I think certain bread items are available on only certain days so Id visit on pretzel day,positive,175,150-200,1008,1000-1500

Its ice cream I mean come on lets be honest here the pricing is a bit out of control,negative,19,<50,89,<500
I do love the Bouchon Bakery macaroons However what I did not enjoylove was watching the young lady start to package the ones I ordered and not change her gloves after handling the other pastries I did ask her to do so she did but then apparently proceeded to package the wrong macaroons I did not notice until I opened the box to enjoy during the drive home Management please educate your team about cross contamination as well as double checking orders to make sure the correct orders are being gathered,negative,91,75-100,513,500-1000
Well it was 46F when I decided I needed to have ice cream Cant let the opportunity pass and went in to get me some espresso oreo The shop was practically empty I wasnt surprised because it was freezing then The ice cream was really good I especially like coffee flavored ice cream and this one didnt disappoint I failed to take a pic of it just because I was hurrying to go back to my hotel I will definitely come back and get the other coffee flavored ice cream they have,positive,92,75-100,489,<500
We are frequent patrons of this place and we like to try the variety of flavors we are four of family and this takes a little time  this Tiara cashier not friendly and apparently had a bad day nothing friendly  In the 4 times we have been here shes had a bad day   The ice cream is great,negative,61,50-75,300,<500
This place is SO SO SO good So glad they reopened The parking is behind the building but there is a back door for ease of access to the building,positive,30,25-50,147,<500
We waited in line for forever just so I could get two scoops of ice cream When we got to the front I realized it was taking so long because they literally have someone write down your ice cream order Whats the point of writing down that I want two scoops in a cone Wouldnt it just be faster to scoop it and hand it over Anyways this stupid process was causing a huge backup When I finally got my ice cream I was v disappointed It had barely any flavor and just tasted like heavy whipping cream the kind that leaves a layer of fat in your mouth My scoop of chocolate tasted no different than the peanut butter cup just oily The waffle cone wasnt good either I threw it away in less time than I waited to get it Would have rather gambled those 8,negative,148,100-150,760,500-1000
Came here because I really wanted to try their donuts Its in downtown and parking wasnt that convenient but thanks for the meters I got in and out Its a cute donut shop Its small inside and you go in and get in line to order I got 2 creme brÃlÃe donuts and I also got the Nutella donut The Nutella donut was 4 and the creme brÃlÃe was 2 Definitely reasonable prices I would have to say I love love love the creme brÃlÃe donut Its my favorite and I loved the Nutella one too but creme brÃlÃe definitely has my heart I will definitely come back here for sure,positive,111,100-150,581,500-1000
None of the employees are wearing any kind of masks gloves our any thing to prevent them from infecting the ice cream will they lean over the freezer and scoop multiple times in a row the kid say there inches from my daughters ice cream taking to us through the window 3 different times I made her scoop the top scoop off and throw away the spoon before she ate half of what she order Im not going back and risking eating uncooked food with no precautions to keep from contaminating everything Not just what that are Scooping but every container in every freezer they lean over and drool on If you arent going to do it right DONT REOPEN The ice cream is always great but good me a goddamn break How do you not even Provide a way to safely serve n uncooked food item You are not essential and shouldnt be able to remain open,negative,158,150-200,842,500-1000
Dear Milk Bar My daughter was so excited to get a Milk Bar cookie She loves Chef Christina Tolsi from Master Chef Junior She inspired my daughter to bake Now the person behind the counter had a terrible attitude and really ruined a happy experience My girl just ate all her veggies at dinner so this was a real treat and its been a tradition to get a Milk Bar cookie after dinner at the Cosmo So we are very familiar except they dont display the cookies anymore I told the young lady if we may know what cookies they had this evening as we cant see them anymore and dont know what they had at the moment She just gave us a stare I asked again what cookies they had She just what do you want I again asked what do you have She asked what do you like I asked again what do you have Then she mentions two cookies At this point my daughter is confused I then asked if we can see She then shows us two cookies I asked if thats all they had She said no their are more At this point REALLY We ended up getting getting a couple of cookies but it wasnt pleasant I could not believe since we had great experiences in the past And for some reason because the customer service was awful the cookies didnt taste that great It didnt have a happy taste this evening A good attitude goes a long way,negative,255,250-300,1322,1000-1500
This place is worth finding Up an escalator and down a hallway that leads outside is where youll find Carlos Small Yes its very small but kust the right size to get in and out A little pricey IMO but everything was fantastic I would go again but ill leave a trail of breadcrumbs to find my way back to the casino,positive,62,50-75,326,<500
Awesome fun place  Music was playing the the staff was friendly Donuts were sooo yummy and full of flavor and the size was huge ,positive,26,25-50,134,<500
I just came here for macarons They are a good monetary value but the taste is just meh Salted Caramel was a sugar bomb too heavy too sweet too meh 25 Pistachio was a little better 355 They didnt taste very fresh,negative,42,25-50,223,<500
Meh not impressed about average donut place I got almost every donut they had and none of them blew me away except the price of them Nice staff Quik service but sad to say I wont be back to this place,negative,41,25-50,204,<500
Lack of covid compliance Owner refused to put on a mask and told me to mind my own business until I pay his bills Wont return,negative,26,25-50,129,<500
Absolutely the worst service Ive ever received The main manager there was freaking out that we had even entered the building which we didnt know wasnt allowed the doors were wide open Then we didnt have a mask which I understand theres pandemic but when we are about 30 feet away theres no reason to freak out and immediately call a building manager to get us out Just the rudeness from the staff makes me never want to visit the ice cream shop again,negative,84,75-100,468,<500
I have been here 3 times and each time was an unfriendly experience The girl with dark hair and glasses is the rudest person I have ever been in contact with Miserable would describe her best she should not work with the general public Lawrenceville is a great community with some pretty awesome local businesses Please dont support this bakery they are not appreciative of your business and will likely treat you like an inconvenience for even stepping foot into the Butterwood Also the cake is overpriced and really doesnt taste that good,negative,93,75-100,553,500-1000
Cake was frozen and thawed terribly dry Was so pumped to eat here Dont bother 30 for two terrible slices,negative,20,<50,111,<500
Love it Its an odd place to put a bakery at the back of an escalator Line wasnt that long and it moves fast Strawberry Croissant pretty sweet and jammy Love the top crumbs on the top Its interesting and not a lot of places sell strawberry croissant Chocolate Croissant Very buttery and flaky It was so delicious and flakes were everywhere Chocolate wasnt overwhelming Bacon Egg Croissant Such a good togo breakfast The eggs texture was pretty off and rubbery though Macarons Bigger than the usual size but the price matches it No extraordinary flavors just the basics vanilla chocolate caramel espresso pistachio and strawberry Each were good and had the right texture,positive,114,100-150,700,500-1000
Was looking forward to a variety of delicious cupcakes my daughter saw it on Cupcake wars so we assumed they had to be amazing Very disappointed They were very dry all of them I tried the German chocolate sprinkles and the red velvet I am assuming we were sold old cupcakes unless they were over cooked,negative,56,50-75,313,<500
Anything attached to the Bouchon name gets 5 stars in my book We ate at the restaurant the morning prior and knew we HAD to stop by the bakery on our way back to the airport before we left Its located kind of hidden behind the escalators on the casino level of the Venetian We trekked back with a chocolate croissant and a sticky bun on a 2hour flight and enjoyed them with a glass of milk at home Perfect way to end the day that once began in Vegas,positive,90,75-100,460,<500
This place is delicious The only reason I didnt give it 5 Stars was the seating situation If there was indoor seating it would be an easy 5 Stars The staff was friendly and patient as it took a while to read through all of the flavors I look forward to going back,positive,53,50-75,269,<500
A good way to start down the road of decadence Donut Bar offers many varieties of donuts I must say the creme brulee donut was delicious while the other donuts were pretty good as well I got a cappuccino to accompany my donuts although a regular coffee would have fitted better The space is pretty small the glass window allows too much sun joking and there is a nice patio out back Pretty cool place,positive,75,50-75,414,<500
Wow after 2 hours waiting finally they open another line for cashier  this is a last time to come here  really bad management and services are bad  people be aware dont go this time yet  wait 34 months after the crow get tired ,negative,48,25-50,245,<500
So disappointing The pain is chocolate and croissant beurre were overdone a crumbly mess Nothing at all like Paris or Montreal jean talon,negative,23,<50,141,<500
I was very excited to try these donuts I finally made time to go to this donut shop on my day off I purchased 4 donuts  was given an additional 4 donuts for free The customer service was good but the donuts were not I was sadly disappointed in these donuts I will most likely choose another place to buy donuts whenever I get a craving,negative,67,50-75,343,<500
The manager was working on a Friday night and he was so friendly let us try anyflavors and gave us extra sized portions above what we ordered I love the old fashioned real ice cream,positive,35,25-50,184,<500
Love the ice cream here would Recommend to any one who loves ice cream Its a great date night snack or if your just out with friends,positive,27,25-50,134,<500
A very addictive place to have ice cream The Toffee Banofi is better than any thing I have eaten in Arizona I sampled the Bleau Cheese ice cream  thought I found heaven I also purchased some Bacon BrittleThe bacon is something that needs to tried out  stored in packages for disaster prepareness Forget about the essentials You need the Bcaon Brittle,positive,63,50-75,363,<500
Although the shop itself and baked goods are very aesthetically pleasing Im sad to say I was disappointed I paid 7 for their specialty drinks I do have to pay extra for dairy free milk to be fair and it has been lukewarm on 2 separate occasions It is also freezing in the building Myself and everyone around me are wearing their winter coats I rarely bring up complaints but asked an employee if there was something that could be done and was pretty much brushed off I thought seeing everyone wear their winter coats inside should have been a sufficient hint itself For 7 I was hoping to escape the cold to settle in a cozy shop  warm up with a latte but that is just not the experience you will get here I also do not recommend going there to study or work There is not much seating and I dont get the vibe that they want you to stay long Its more for grabbing a treat enjoying it and then leaving,negative,175,150-200,923,500-1000
I dont get the hype over this place Maybe the flagship store is better We went twice in one week hoping that maybe we just didnt get the right thing but the experience wasnt great each time The birthday cake is a big piece recommend sharing pretty tasty but its definitely not fresh Cold crunchy and a little dry 14 for a slice of cake and its just famous because of the branding  its not actually good We tried the cereal milk soft serve with rainbow sprinkles and even that was sour and salty  not very good 2 stars because they have an amazing brand and excellent cold brew The coffee is the only good thing Even the service was bad,negative,123,100-150,661,500-1000
Well what can I say about Handels some few years later Not good  As I left my review all those years ago it remains the exact same in regards to the Graham Central Station Now i will say over the past few months I have given them numerous occasions to come thru for me only to fail The owner years ago told me it only has to clumps of sugar when he makes it as the kids dont make it right So I decide to call and ask for him to give him my opinion on the failed GCS I get another person In charge who tells me oh its the supply chain shortage I am thinking hmmm brown sugar is in low supply  Sugar Needless to say the 2 she made me were still lacking  Basically you get one of three kind of GCS  1 Solid plain ice cream no brown sugar Graham crackers I assume and no black balls 2 Solid ice cream with several black balls and zero brown sugar  Graham 3 Tiny bit of brown sugar  Graham and some black balls All of the above is so lackluster You new people do not know what you are actually missing when it is made right and that has just never going to happen Too bad but also I dont need to get fat so keep making it poorly and use the excuse of the shortage when you were making it crappy years before pandemic and supply chain  Ha,negative,258,250-300,1273,1000-1500
Ive been craving for taho for so long that I randomly searched it here on Yelp Pleasantly surprised to learn about Scooptopia and so happy to finally get my taho fix after years It was still warm the tapioca was freshly made and it wasnt too sweet We also got halohalo sago drink and ice cream Everything was exceptional Also worth mentioning are the very nice people behind the counter who were so helpful and accomodating,positive,76,75-100,434,<500
Hong Kong or should I say I think the Asians make the worst deserts unless theyre copying the West The Europeans make the best deserts on the planet FACT Still This bakery isnt any better than the deserts you buy in Little Italy or Commercial Drive or Broadway Greek area in Vancouver BC Canada so its not worth the wait in the line along with hipsters and those who dont know,negative,71,50-75,390,<500
I love love love this place I miss it The donuts are phenomenal Its well worth the drive out of the way theres a Krispy Kreme around the corner where I stay when I visit I pass by a Dunkin Donut or two on the way Theyre that delicious,positive,49,25-50,247,<500
This place is living on a name only When you go expect a long wait in line mostly because the staff is not set up right and does not know how to process a long line They do not have any dedicated stations for the staff One register person and she is floating between taking orders filling orders and checking people out It is a mess The food we had was mediocre at best I have been to MUCH better Italian bakeries I think since the boss is away  in NJ the mice will play and all I can say is the quality of what we ordered was not great The only decent item was the Lobster roll but that is not enough to get me to go back here and endure the long lines,negative,136,100-150,666,500-1000
Not sure what the hype is about Im a diehard ice cream and sweets lover but I just couldnt put my finger on anything that wowed me  Compost cookie almost too sweet Texture was not my cup of tea Have had better cookies  Soft serve with the corn flakes you could recreate this at home with some softened vanilla ice cream and cereal  Birthday cake balls probably the best thing I tried At least it was moist But have also had better cake pops It left me wondering why there was a line at opening but perhaps we just didnt try the right thing,negative,107,100-150,563,500-1000
super rich super creamy super delicious they let you sample and there are quite a variety of flavors there has to be something for everyone here they even have soy icecream and cookie bowls i didnt know that was a thing but it is,positive,44,25-50,239,<500
I loved this place but theyve moved to being a pop up shop out front of Jobot Coffee right down the street FridaySunday only the sign out front of their original location right now is a little misleading I watched three other groups of customers walk into Jobot and ask where melt went tonight hopefully the actual store comes back soon  not sure if its closed or just under construction,positive,71,50-75,398,<500
Even though they only have one vegan option it is totally worth it to stop in if you are down this way I thought I had saw Sprinkles listed on HappyCow so when I walked by I had to run in and check I asked the friendly cashier and he told me they have a vegan red velvet cupcake I got one for my friend and I to share They told us it would be a couple minutes as they were freshly frosting one for us It came out in a cute paperbag with an adorable Sprinkles sticker on it My friend and I pulled it out and immediately got excited because they add a candy V on the top for the vegan ones The added touch of that was enough to sell me as a lifetime customer haha Now to get to the good stuff the cupcake was moist sweet and absolutely delicious The frosting had a cream cheese taste to it that was absolutely perfect And honestly probably the best vegan cupcake Ive ever had and that says a lot because Ive had a lot of vegan cupcakes in my day haha The building also needs mention The outside has the most adorable flashing lights of course its Vegas which in itself entices you to go in The sidewalks outside have adorable Hollywood stars that say things like dark chocolate What a cute touch Inside is not overly big but it was comfortable for us and they have a line of chairs looking out the window so you can gorge on your cupcake right there,positive,267,250-300,1377,1000-1500
What else can I say that hasnt already been said Churn makes really great old fashioned ice cream with some unique modern flavors Love the cute shop with all the nostalgic candy and the little patio oasis out back Since I live in the burbs the parking stresses me out but I love that they have the 15 minute parking right up front so if you are just stopping in to get a cone rather than having dinner at Windsor you can get in and out easily,positive,87,75-100,451,<500
This is my friends and Is favorite place to get dessert while we are out There is a big parking lot behind Mitchells with the first hour and a half of parking free making it a pretty easy place to get to downtown My personal favorites are the raspberry sorbet mango sorbet and the butter pecan The interior of the W 25th location is very neat with seating both downstairs and upstairs with glass walls allowing you to watch the ice cream being made I also love to go here with my family as everyone loves the treat and being able to watch ice cream being made,positive,107,100-150,571,500-1000
Was extremely disappointed in this place The gelato flavors were not unique and the texture was more on the watery side I was hoping for a nice creamy texture but nope not here I got the cookie cup of course because why not since thats what they are known for Thought it was a little on the pricier side and the marshmallow was way too salty did not expect that at all So if youre not the type that likes sweet and salty youre in for a huge shock like me Pros  youll get a nice picture for instagram  the macaroon cookie was nice and chewy Cons parking was not the best expensive  SALTY,negative,117,100-150,607,500-1000
After sampling their ice cream at the new location and comparing the taste and texture of what I remember at the old 7th location the conclusion is this cant be the exact same recipe they claim it is Besides the fact that some of my favorites are gone Lemon Custard the Butter Pecan was very strange Instead of being the usual ice cream in a frozen form or in a melty form it was gummy and more like a gelato than their 20 butterfat or whatever it is they claim it is The Burgundy Cherry also had that same gelatogummy texture and the taste was some sort of fake pungently sweet cherry Maybe it has to do with equipment maybe it has to do with the person putting it together from the supposed exact recipes maybe both maybe they really didnt get the rights to the recipes I dont knowIve never made ice cream and I dont know what really went on beyond what was published in the media But I do know it is NOT the same as before Baskin Robbins cherry and Lemon Custard were very close to the original Mary Coyles and seeing how Marys not up to my expected standard Baskins is getting my business now Current business owners take note,negative,215,200-250,1165,1000-1500
Okay what the heck happened This place used to be my go to place for a quick snack when I stayed at the Venetian Now everything is mediocre at best The macarons were stale and the croissant was meh Very very disappointing Probably wont be coming here for a quick snack again,negative,52,50-75,283,<500
Just picked up a cake I ordered for my girlfriends birthday It was supposed to be a white cake with a toasted buttercream icing but it was the most odd cake Ive ever had Lets start with the high points the icing was AMAZING and it was decorated beautifully Now the lowAs soon as we took our first bite we both said it tastes like shrimp Yes shrimp I have no idea what in the world would make a cake taste like that but it doesits inedible It smells odd too and completely crumbles apart I had such high hopes but was completely disappointed I might try again in the future but not anytime soon,negative,115,100-150,616,500-1000
I have watched many episodes of cake boss and have wanted to go to the cake shop for 3 years I finally got to go there this Summer and was very disappointed with the deserts I tried the brownie which was really hard and the chocolate covered cheesecake was just OK and the chocolate eclair didnt taste as good either Overall i would not recommend this place I just think it is over hyped,negative,74,50-75,393,<500
so reading the reviews for this shop I was expecting some deliciousness some extraordinary some awesomeness and all I got was another wtf moment and a feeling of should I call and complain and ask for my money backI mean I dropped 25 for 8 donutsya lets get to the review so I found myself in the downtown area recently and remember hearing about a donut that crunched on top looked it up and was happy it was there so I drove over to the spot in downtown and checked it out walked into the shop its small narrow but it gets right to the point the display of donuts was very nice they all look delicious and in my mind I was excited to finally try the assortment I was putting together I went for 2 of the creme brulee donuts one that I think had a velvet cake inside one of the poptart donuts a white sprinkle and a chocolate top one and some others total was 25 price shock hits its donuts but ok I paid it drove home and dove in with wifey this is where it just went wrong now I usually dont take photos but recently I have been of the meals and stuff Im eating or places Im going to and this place got the picture every single donut we ate was dry they were all over cooked I guess the batter used had no flavor or sweetness the flavors were not there it was like trying to enjoy it but notI only took a bite or 2 of each donut and trashed it throughout the day just picked at them all when I got the one that crunches the creme brulee one I was just SO let down the taste was honestly gross that mixture of the crunch on the top of your mouth then mixing it with a softdry donut that has no flavor was just really gross and Im not picky especially when it comes to what should have been sweet and delicious was a major fail again every donut was dry and they all had no flavor or bland flavoring even the pop tart donut was a bust the cake mix they use is just no good I dont know if it was that day or what but no go for me now Ive tried pink box donuts which was ok the only donut shop here in town that seems to be excellent every time is Winchells on Meadows Lane with the subway that place is 5 star superb I understand though this donut bar place it made it on tv or whatever and people want to see it but all these 5 star reviews is just not possible if its consistently like my experience when quality comes in check out my photosyoull see what I mean,negative,478,300- 500,2465,2000+

I had three kinds because I could not decide on one Handcrafted creamy deliciousness Amazing customer service the owner greets you by name and answers any questions never rushes you despite the line encourages you to sample them all and thanks you for coming in An experience far beyond a cup or cone Id absolutely recommend this place to anybody and everybody Ill be thinking about this place when I leave Arizona and I already cannot wait to return,positive,79,75-100,461,<500
My husband friends and I were super excited when visiting Vegas and stumbled up the escalator at The Cosmopolitan to the Milk Bar I am a HUGE Tosi fan and was expecting to be wowed My husband and I ordered a full Birthday Cake togo We waited 30 minutes for the cake They boxed it up for us as we wanted to enjoy the cake back in our hotel room I was so disappointed once we dug in The cake tasted sour mainly the frosting It really had this spoiled sour taste This has left me questioning their quality control Did they make the frosting with spoiled milk We dont live in Vegas so maybe Ill have to give the LA store a try someday Or maybe well get one in San Francisco someday,negative,134,100-150,698,500-1000
